    az disk : Manage Azure Managed Disks.
        Azure Virtual Machines use disks as a place to store an operating system, applications, and
        data. All Azure virtual machines have at least two disks: An operating system disk, and a
        temporary disk. The operating system disk is created from an image, and both the operating
        system disk and the image are actually virtual hard disks (VHDs) stored in an Azure storage
        account. Virtual machines also can have one or more data disks, that are also stored as
        VHDs.
        Azure Unmanaged Data Disks have a maximum size of 4095 GB. To use didks larger than 4095 GB
        use [Azure Managed Disks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/managed-disks-
        overview).

Commands:
    create        : Create a managed disk.
    delete        : Delete a managed disk.
    grant-access  : Grant a resource access to a managed disk.
    list          : List managed disks.
