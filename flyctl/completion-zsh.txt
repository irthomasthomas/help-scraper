Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

$ echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

To load completions for every new session, execute once:
# Linux:
$ flyctl completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_flyctl"
# macOS:
$ flyctl completion zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_flyctl

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

Usage:
  flyctl completion zsh [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help              help for zsh
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions

Global Flags:
  -t, --access-token string   Fly API Access Token
      --verbose               Verbose output
