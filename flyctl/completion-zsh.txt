Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.  If shell completion
is not already enabled in your environment you will need to enable it.  You
can execute the following once:  	echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >>
~/.zshrc  To load completions in your current shell session:  	source <(flyctl
completion zsh)  To load completions for every new session, execute once:  ####
Linux:  	flyctl completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_flyctl"  #### macOS:  	flyctl
completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_flyctl  You will
need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

Usage:
  flyctl completion zsh [flags]

  -h, --help              help for zsh
