Generate the autocompletion script for the bash shell.

This script depends on the 'bash-completion' package.
If it is not installed already, you can install it via your OS's package manager.

To load completions in your current shell session:
$ source <(flyctl completion bash)

To load completions for every new session, execute once:
Linux:
  $ flyctl completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/flyctl
MacOS:
  $ flyctl completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/flyctl

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

Usage:
  flyctl completion bash

Flags:
  -h, --help              help for bash
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions

Global Flags:
  -t, --access-token string   Fly API Access Token
      --verbose               Verbose output
