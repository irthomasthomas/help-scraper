DESCRIPTION
       Welcome to the Entity Resolution API Reference .

       Entity  Resolution  is  an  Amazon  Web  Services service that provides
       pre-configured entity resolution capabilities  that  enable  developers
       and  analysts  at advertising and marketing companies to build an accu-
       rate and complete view of their consumers.

       With Entity Resolution, you can match source  records  containing  con-
       sumer  identifiers, such as name, email address, and phone number. This
       is true even when these records have incomplete or conflicting  identi-
       fiers.  For  example,  Entity Resolution can effectively match a source
       record from a customer relationship  management  (CRM)  system  with  a
       source record from a marketing system containing campaign information.

       To  learn  more  about Entity Resolution concepts, procedures, and best
       practices, see the Entity Resolution User Guide .
