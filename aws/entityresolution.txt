DESCRIPTION
       Welcome to the AWS Entity Resolution API Reference .

       AWS  Entity  Resolution  is an AWS service that provides pre-configured
       entity resolution capabilities that enable developers and  analysts  at
       advertising  and  marketing companies to build an accurate and complete
       view of their consumers.

       With AWS Entity Resolution,  you  have  the  ability  to  match  source
       records  containing  consumer identifiers, such as name, email address,
       and phone number. This holds true even when these records  have  incom-
       plete  or  conflicting  identifiers. For example, AWS Entity Resolution
       can effectively match a source record from a customer relationship man-
       agement  (CRM)  system,  which  includes account information like first
       name, last name, postal address, phone number, and email address,  with
       a  source  record  from a marketing system containing campaign informa-
       tion, such as username and email address.

       To learn more about AWS Entity  Resolution  concepts,  procedures,  and
       best practices, see the AWS Entity Resolution User Guide .
