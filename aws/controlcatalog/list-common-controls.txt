LIST-COMMON-CONTROLS()                                  LIST-COMMON-CONTROLS()



NAME
       list-common-controls -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  paginated  list of common controls from the Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Control Catalog.

       You can apply an optional filter to see common  controls  that  have  a
       specific objective. If you dont provide a filter, the operation returns
       all common controls.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-common-controls is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: CommonControls

OPTIONS
       --common-control-filter (structure)
          An optional filter that narrows the results to a specific objective.

          This filter allows you to specify one objective ARN at a time. Pass-
          ing multiple ARNs in the  CommonControlFilter  isnt  currently  sup-
          ported.

          Objectives -> (list)
              The objective that's used as filter criteria.

              You  can  use  this  parameter to specify one objective ARN at a
              time. Passing multiple ARNs in the CommonControlFilter isnt cur-
              rently supported.

              (structure)
                 The objective resource that's being used as a filter.

                 Arn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the objective.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Objectives=[{Arn=string},{Arn=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Objectives": [
              {
                "Arn": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
