DESCRIBE-TAGS()                                                DESCRIBE-TAGS()



NAME
       describe-tags -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of tags. You can return tags from a specific resource by
       specifying an ARN, or you can return all tags for a given type  of  re-
       source, such as clusters, snapshots, and so on.

       The following are limitations for DescribeTags :

       o You  cannot  specify an ARN and a resource-type value together in the
         same request.

       o You cannot use the MaxRecords and Marker parameters together with the
         ARN parameter.

       o The  MaxRecords parameter can be a range from 10 to 50 results to re-
         turn in a request.

       If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon
       Redshift returns all resources that match any combination of the speci-
       fied keys and values. For example, if you have  owner  and  environment
       for  tag  keys,  and  admin and test for tag values, all resources that
       have any combination of those values are returned.

       If both tag keys and values are omitted from the request, resources are
       returned  regardless of whether they have tag keys or values associated
       with them.

       describe-tags is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: TaggedResources

OPTIONS
       --resource-name (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) for which you want to describe the
          tag or tags. For example, arn:aws:redshift:us-east-2:123456789:clus-
          ter:t1 .

       --resource-type (string)
          The  type  of  resource  with which you want to view tags. Valid re-
          source types are:

          o Cluster

          o CIDR/IP

          o EC2 security group

          o Snapshot

          o Cluster security group

          o Subnet group

          o HSM connection

          o HSM certificate

          o Parameter group

          o Snapshot copy grant

          o Integration (zero-ETL integration or S3 event integration)

          NOTE:
              To describe the tags associated  with  an  integration  ,  don't
              specify  ResourceType  , instead specify the ResourceName of the
              integration.

          For more information about Amazon Redshift resource types  and  con-
          structing  ARNs, go to Specifying Policy Elements: Actions, Effects,
          Resources, and Principals in the Amazon Redshift Cluster  Management
          Guide.

       --tag-keys (list)
          A  tag  key  or  keys  for which you want to return all matching re-
          sources that are associated with the specified key or keys. For  ex-
          ample, suppose that you have resources tagged with keys called owner
          and environment . If you specify both of these tag keys in  the  re-
          quest,  Amazon  Redshift  returns a response with all resources that
          have either or both of these tag keys associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tag-values (list)
          A tag value or values for which you want to return all matching  re-
          sources  that are associated with the specified value or values. For
          example, suppose that you have resources tagged with  values  called
          admin  and test . If you specify both of these tag values in the re-
          quest, Amazon Redshift returns a response with  all  resources  that
          have either or both of these tag values associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe tags

       The  following  describe-tags example displays the resources the speci-
       fied cluster associated with the specified tag names and values.

          aws redshift describe-tags \
              --resource-name arn:aws:redshift:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:mycluster \
              --tag-keys clustertagkey \
              --tag-values clustertagvalue

       Output:

          {
              "TaggedResources": [
                              {
                      "Tag": {
                          "Key": "clustertagkey",
                          "Value": "clustertagvalue"
                      },
                      "ResourceName": "arn:aws:redshift:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:mycluster",
                      "ResourceType": "cluster"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Marker -> (string)
          A  value  that  indicates the starting point for the next set of re-
          sponse records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in  a
          response, you can retrieve the next set of records by providing this
          returned marker value in the Marker parameter and retrying the  com-
          mand.  If  the Marker field is empty, all response records have been
          retrieved for the request.
