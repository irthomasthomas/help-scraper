DELETE-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()                            DELETE-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       delete-cluster-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  specified  manual  snapshot.  The snapshot must be in the
       available state, with no other users authorized to access the snapshot.

       Unlike automated snapshots, manual snapshots are  retained  even  after
       you  delete  your  cluster. Amazon Redshift does not delete your manual
       snapshots. You must delete manual snapshot explicitly to avoid  getting
       charged.  If  other accounts are authorized to access the snapshot, you
       must revoke all of the authorizations before you can delete  the  snap-
       shot.

OPTIONS
       --snapshot-identifier (string)
          The unique identifier of the manual snapshot to be deleted.

          Constraints: Must be the name of an existing snapshot that is in the
          available , failed , or cancelled state.

       --snapshot-cluster-identifier (string)
          The unique identifier of the cluster the snapshot was created  from.
          This  parameter is required if your IAM user has a policy containing
          a snapshot resource element that specifies anything other than * for
          the cluster name.

          Constraints: Must be the name of valid cluster.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                as "creating".

              o DescribeClusterSnapshots returns status as "creating", "avail-
                able", "final snapshot", or "failed".

              o DeleteClusterSnapshot returns status as "deleted".

              For  manual  snapshots,  the Amazon Web Services account used to
              create or copy the snapshot. For automatic snapshots, the  owner
              of the cluster. The owner can perform all snapshot actions, such
              as sharing a manual snapshot.

          TotalBackupSizeInMegaBytes -> (double)

              An  option that specifies whether to create the cluster with en-
              hanced VPC routing enabled. To create a cluster  that  uses  en-
              hanced  VPC  routing, the cluster must be in a VPC. For more in-
              formation, see Enhanced VPC Routing in the Amazon Redshift Clus-
              ter Management Guide.

              If this option is true , enhanced VPC routing is enabled.
