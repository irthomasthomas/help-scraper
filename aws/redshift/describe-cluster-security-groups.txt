DESCRIBE-CLUSTER-SECURITY-GROUPS()          DESCRIBE-CLUSTER-SECURITY-GROUPS()



NAME
       describe-cluster-security-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about Amazon Redshift security groups. If the name
       of a security group is specified, the response will contain only infor-
       mation about only that security group.

       For  information  about managing security groups, go to Amazon Redshift
       Cluster Security Groups in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide
       .

       If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon
       Redshift returns all security groups that match any combination of  the
       specified  keys and values. For example, if you have owner and environ-
       ment for tag keys, and admin and test  for  tag  values,  all  security
       groups that have any combination of those values are returned.

       If  both  tag  keys  and  values are omitted from the request, security
       groups are returned regardless of whether they have tag keys or  values
       associated with them.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-cluster-security-groups is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: ClusterSecurityGroups

OPTIONS
       --cluster-security-group-name (string)
          The name of a cluster security group for which  you  are  requesting
          details.  You must specify either the Marker parameter or a Cluster-
          SecurityGroupName parameter, but not both.

          Example: securitygroup1

       --tag-keys (list)
          A tag key or keys for which you want to return all matching  cluster
          security  groups that are associated with the specified key or keys.
          For example, suppose that you have security groups that  are  tagged
          with  keys  called  owner  and  environment . If you specify both of
          these tag keys in the request, Amazon Redshift  returns  a  response
          with  the security groups that have either or both of these tag keys
          associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tag-values (list)
          A tag value or values for which you  want  to  return  all  matching
          cluster  security  groups that are associated with the specified tag
          value or values. For example, suppose that you have security  groups
          that  are  tagged with values called admin and test . If you specify
          both of these tag values in the request, Amazon Redshift  returns  a
          response  with the security groups that have either or both of these
          tag values associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

   Get a Description of All Cluster Security Groups
       This  example  returns a description of all cluster security groups for
       the account.  By default, the output is in JSON format.

          aws redshift describe-cluster-security-groups

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          A value that indicates the starting point for the next  set  of  re-
          sponse  records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in a
          response, you can retrieve the next set of records by providing this
          returned  marker value in the Marker parameter and retrying the com-
          mand. If the Marker field is empty, all response records  have  been
          retrieved for the request.
