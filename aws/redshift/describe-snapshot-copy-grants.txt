NAME
       describe-snapshot-copy-grants -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of snapshot copy grants owned by the Amazon Web Services
       account in the destination region.

       For more information about managing snapshot copy grants, go to  Amazon
       Redshift  Database Encryption in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management
       Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-snapshot-copy-grants is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: SnapshotCopyGrants

SYNOPSIS
            describe-snapshot-copy-grants
          [--snapshot-copy-grant-name <value>]
          [--tag-keys <value>]
          [--tag-values <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --snapshot-copy-grant-name (string)
          The name of the snapshot copy grant.

       --tag-keys (list)
          A  tag  key  or  keys  for which you want to return all matching re-
          sources that are associated with the specified key or keys. For  ex-
          ample, suppose that you have resources tagged with keys called owner
          and environment . If you specify both of these tag keys in  the  re-
          quest,  Amazon  Redshift  returns a response with all resources that
          have either or both of these tag keys associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tag-values (list)
          A tag value or values for which you want to return all matching  re-
          sources  that are associated with the specified value or values. For
          example, suppose that you have resources tagged with  values  called
          admin  and test . If you specify both of these tag values in the re-
          quest, Amazon Redshift returns a response with  all  resources  that
          have either or both of these tag values associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe snapshot copy grants

       The following describe-snapshot-copy-grants  example  displays  details
       for the specified cluster snapshot copy grant.

          aws redshift describe-snapshot-copy-grants \
              --snapshot-copy-grant-name mysnapshotcopygrantname

       Output:

          {
              "SnapshotCopyGrants": [
                  {
                      "SnapshotCopyGrantName": "mysnapshotcopygrantname",
                      "KmsKeyId": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/bPxRfih3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY",
                      "Tags": []
                  }
              ]
          }

       Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An optional parameter that specifies the starting point to return  a
          set of response records. When the results of a DescribeSnapshotCopy-
          Grant request exceed the value specified in MaxRecords , Amazon  Web
          Services  returns  a  value in the Marker field of the response. You
          can retrieve the next set of response records by providing  the  re-
          turned  marker  value  in  the Marker parameter and retrying the re-
          quest.

          Constraints: You can specify either the SnapshotCopyGrantName param-
          eter or the Marker parameter, but not both.

       SnapshotCopyGrants -> (list)
          The list of SnapshotCopyGrant objects.

          (structure)
              The  snapshot  copy grant that grants Amazon Redshift permission
              to encrypt copied snapshots with the specified encrypted symmet-
              ric key from Amazon Web Services KMS in the destination region.

              Amazon Redshift Database Encryption in the Amazon Redshift Clus-
              ter Management Guide .

              SnapshotCopyGrantName -> (string)
                 The name of the snapshot copy grant.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The  unique identifier of the encrypted symmetric key in Ama-
                 zon Web Services KMS to which Amazon Redshift is granted per-
                 mission.

              Tags -> (list)
                 A list of tag instances.

                 (structure)
                     A tag consisting of a name/value pair for a resource.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key, or name, for the resource tag.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value for the resource tag.
