NAME
       revoke-snapshot-access -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes the ability of the specified Amazon Web Services account to re-
       store the specified snapshot. If the account is currently restoring the
       snapshot, the restore will run to completion.

       For  more  information  about working with snapshots, go to Amazon Red-
       shift Snapshots in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide .

OPTIONS
       --snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the snapshot that the account can  no  longer  ac-
          cess.

       --snapshot-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the snapshot associated with the
          message to revoke access.

       --snapshot-cluster-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the cluster the snapshot was  created  from.  This
          parameter  is  required  if  your IAM user has a policy containing a
          snapshot resource element that specifies anything other than  *  for
          the cluster name.

       --account-with-restore-access (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Web Services account that can no longer
          restore the specified snapshot.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       This example revokes the authorization of the AWS account  444455556666
       to  restore  the  snapshot my-snapshot-id. By default, the output is in
       JSON format.

              An option that specifies whether to create the cluster with  en-
              hanced  VPC  routing  enabled. To create a cluster that uses en-
              hanced VPC routing, the cluster must be in a VPC. For  more  in-
              formation, see Enhanced VPC Routing in the Amazon Redshift Clus-
              ter Management Guide.

              If this option is true , enhanced VPC routing is enabled.

          ManualSnapshotRemainingDays -> (integer)
              The  number of days until a manual snapshot will pass its reten-
              tion period.
