OPTIONS
       --data-share-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the datashare to  remove  associa-
          tion for.

       --disassociate-entire-account | --no-disassociate-entire-account (bool-
       ean)
          A value that specifies whether association for the datashare is  re-
          moved from the entire account.

       --consumer-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the consumer namespace that asso-
          ciation for the datashare is removed from.

       --consumer-region (string)
          From  a  datashare  consumer  account,  removes  association  of   a
          datashare  from all the existing and future namespaces in the speci-
          fied Amazon Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
