CREATE-HSM-CONFIGURATION()                          CREATE-HSM-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       create-hsm-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an HSM configuration that contains the information required by
       an Amazon Redshift cluster to store and use database encryption keys in
       a Hardware Security Module (HSM). After creating the HSM configuration,
       you can specify it as a parameter when creating a cluster. The  cluster
       will then store its encryption keys in the HSM.

       In  addition  to creating an HSM configuration, you must also create an
       HSM client certificate. For more information, go to  Hardware  Security
       Modules in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --hsm-configuration-identifier (string)
          The identifier to be assigned to the new Amazon Redshift HSM config-
          uration.

       --description (string)
          A text description of the HSM configuration to be created.

       --hsm-ip-address (string)
          The IP address that the Amazon Redshift cluster must use  to  access
          the HSM.

       --hsm-partition-name (string)
          The name of the partition in the HSM where the Amazon Redshift clus-
          ters will store their database encryption keys.

       --hsm-partition-password (string)
          The password required to access the HSM partition.

       --hsm-server-public-certificate (string)
          The HSMs public certificate file. When using  Cloud  HSM,  the  file
          name is server.pem.

       --tags (list)
          A list of tag instances.

          (structure)
              A tag consisting of a name/value pair for a resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key, or name, for the resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an HSM configuration

       The  following  create-hsm-configuration  example creates the specified
       HSM configuration that contains information required by  a  cluster  to
       store  and  use  database encryption keys in a hardware security module
       (HSM).

          aws redshift create-hsm-configuration /
              --hsm-configuration-identifier myhsmconnection
              --description "My HSM connection"
              --hsm-ip-address 192.0.2.09
              --hsm-partition-name myhsmpartition /
              --hsm-partition-password A1b2c3d4 /
              --hsm-server-public-certificate myhsmclientcert

       Output:

          {
              "HsmConfiguration": {
                  "HsmConfigurationIdentifier": "myhsmconnection",
                  "Description": "My HSM connection",
                  "HsmIpAddress": "192.0.2.09",
                  "HsmPartitionName": "myhsmpartition",
                  "Tags": []

          }

              cess the HSM.
