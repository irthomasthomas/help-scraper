DESCRIBE-SNAPSHOT-SCHEDULES()                    DESCRIBE-SNAPSHOT-SCHEDULES()



NAME
       describe-snapshot-schedules -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of snapshot schedules.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-snapshot-schedules  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: SnapshotSchedules

SYNOPSIS
            describe-snapshot-schedules
          [--cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--schedule-identifier <value>]
          [--tag-keys <value>]
          [--tag-values <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The unique identifier for the cluster whose snapshot  schedules  you
          want to view.

       --schedule-identifier (string)
          A unique identifier for a snapshot schedule.

       --tag-keys (list)
          The key value for a snapshot schedule tag.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tag-values (list)
          The value corresponding to the key of the snapshot schedule tag.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe snapshot schedules

       The following describe-snapshot-schedules example displays details  for
       the specified cluster snapshot schedule.

          aws redshift describe-snapshot-schedules \
              --cluster-identifier mycluster \
              --schedule-identifier mysnapshotschedule

       Output:

          {
              "SnapshotSchedules": [
                  {
                      "ScheduleDefinitions": [
                          "rate(12 hours)"
                      ],
                      "ScheduleIdentifier": "mysnapshotschedule",
                      "ScheduleDescription": "My schedule description",
                      "Tags": [],
                      "AssociatedClusterCount": 1,
                      "AssociatedClusters": [
                          {
                              "ClusterIdentifier": "mycluster",
                              "ScheduleAssociationState": "ACTIVE"
                          }
                      ]
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       SnapshotSchedules -> (list)
          A list of SnapshotSchedules.

          (structure)
              Describes a snapshot schedule. You can set  a  regular  interval
              for creating snapshots of a cluster. You can also schedule snap-
              shots for specific dates.

              ScheduleDefinitions -> (list)
                 A list of ScheduleDefinitions.

                 (string)

              ScheduleIdentifier -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the schedule.

              ScheduleDescription -> (string)
                 The description of the schedule.

              Tags -> (list)
                 An optional set of tags describing the schedule.

                 (structure)
                     A tag consisting of a name/value pair for a resource.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key, or name, for the resource tag.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value for the resource tag.

              NextInvocations -> (list)
                 (timestamp)

              AssociatedClusterCount -> (integer)
                 The number of clusters associated with the schedule.

              AssociatedClusters -> (list)
                 A list of clusters associated with the schedule. A maximum of
                 100 clusters is returned.

                 (structure)
                     ClusterIdentifier -> (string)

                     ScheduleAssociationState -> (string)

       Marker -> (string)
          A  value  that  indicates the starting point for the next set of re-
          sponse records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in  a
          response, you can retrieve the next set of records by providing this
          returned marker value in the marker parameter and retrying the  com-
          mand.  If  the marker field is empty, all response records have been
          retrieved for the request.
