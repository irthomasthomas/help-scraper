MODIFY-SNAPSHOT-SCHEDULE()                          MODIFY-SNAPSHOT-SCHEDULE()



NAME
       modify-snapshot-schedule -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies a snapshot schedule. Any schedule associated with a cluster is
       modified asynchronously.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-snapshot-schedule
          --schedule-identifier <value>
          --schedule-definitions <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --schedule-identifier (string)
          A unique alphanumeric identifier of the schedule to modify.

       --schedule-definitions (list)
          An updated list of schedule definitions. A  schedule  definition  is
          made up of schedule expressions, for example, "cron(30 12
          *
          )" or "rate(12 hours)".

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 56)
                 Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

                 (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To modify snapshot schedule

       The following modify-snapshot-schedule example modifies the rate of the
       specified snapshot schedule to every 10 hours.

          aws redshift modify-snapshot-schedule \
              --schedule-identifier mysnapshotschedule \
              --schedule-definitions "rate(10 hours)"

       Output:

          {
              "ScheduleDefinitions": [
                  "rate(10 hours)"
              ],
              "ScheduleIdentifier": "mysnapshotschedule",
              "ScheduleDescription": "My schedule description",
              "Tags": []
          }

       For more information, see Snapshot Schedule Format in the  Amazon  Red-
       shift Cluster Management Guide.
