GET-CLUSTER-CREDENTIALS()                            GET-CLUSTER-CREDENTIALS()



NAME
       get-cluster-credentials -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a database user name and temporary password with temporary au-
       thorization to log on to an Amazon Redshift database.  The  action  re-
       turns  the database user name prefixed with IAM: if AutoCreate is False
       or IAMA: if AutoCreate is True . You can optionally specify one or more
       database user groups that the user will join at log on. By default, the
       temporary credentials expire in 900 seconds. You can optionally specify
       a  duration  between 900 seconds (15 minutes) and 3600 seconds (60 min-
       utes). For more information, see Using IAM Authentication  to  Generate
       Database  User  Credentials  in  the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management
       Guide.

       The Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role  that  runs  Get-
       ClusterCredentials  must have an IAM policy attached that allows access
       to all necessary actions and resources. For more information about per-
       missions, see Resource Policies for GetClusterCredentials in the Amazon
       Redshift Cluster Management Guide.

       If the DbGroups parameter is specified, the IAM policy must  allow  the
       redshift:JoinGroup action with access to the listed dbgroups .

       In addition, if the AutoCreate parameter is set to True , then the pol-
       icy must include the redshift:CreateClusterUser permission.

       If the DbName parameter is specified, the IAM policy must allow  access
       to the resource dbname for the specified database name.

OPTIONS
       --db-user (string)
          The  name  of a database user. If a user name matching DbUser exists
          in the database, the temporary user credentials have the  same  per-
          missions  as the existing user. If DbUser doesn't exist in the data-
          base and Autocreate is True , a new user is created using the  value
          for  DbUser with PUBLIC permissions. If a database user matching the
          value for DbUser doesn't exist and Autocreate is False  ,  then  the
          command  succeeds  but  the connection attempt will fail because the
          user doesn't exist in the database.

          For more information, see CREATE USER in the Amazon  Redshift  Data-
          base Developer Guide.

          Constraints:

          o Must  be 1 to 64 alphanumeric characters or hyphens. The user name
            can't be PUBLIC .

          o Cannot  be  a reserved word. A list of reserved words can be found
            in Reserved Words in the Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide.

       --db-name (string)
          The name of a database that DbUser is authorized to log  on  to.  If
          DbName is not specified, DbUser can log on to any existing database.

          Constraints:

          o Must be 1 to 64 alphanumeric characters or hyphens

          o Must not contain a colon ( : ) or slash ( / ).

          o Cannot be a reserved word. A list of reserved words can  be  found

       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The  unique identifier of the cluster that contains the database for
          which you are requesting credentials. This parameter is case  sensi-
          tive.

          DbUser if one does not exist.

       --db-groups (list)
          A list of the names of existing database groups that the user  named
          in  DbUser  will  join  for  the current session, in addition to any
          group memberships for an existing user. If not specified, a new user
          is added only to PUBLIC.

          Database group name constraints

          o Must be 1 to 64 alphanumeric characters or hyphens

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get cluster credentials for an AWS account

       The  following get-cluster-credentials example retrieves temporary cre-
       dentials that enable access to an Amazon Redshift database.

          aws redshift get-cluster-credentials \
              --db-user adminuser --db-name dev \
              --cluster-identifier mycluster

       Output:

          {

              "DbPassword": "AMAFUyyuros/QjxPTtgzcsuQsqzIasdzJEN04aCtWDzXx1O9d6UmpkBtvEeqFly/EXAMPLE==",
              "Expiration": "2019-12-10T17:25:05.770Z"
          }

       Amazon  Redshift  CLI  or API in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       DbUser -> (string)
          A database user name that is authorized to log on  to  the  database
          DbName  using  the password DbPassword . If the specified DbUser ex-
          ists in the database, the new user name has the same  database  per-
          missions  as  the  the user named in DbUser. By default, the user is
          added to PUBLIC. If the DbGroups parameter is  specifed,  DbUser  is
          added to the listed groups for any sessions created using these cre-
          dentials.

       DbPassword -> (string)
          A temporary password that  authorizes  the  user  name  returned  by
          DbUser to log on to the database DbName .

       Expiration -> (timestamp)
          The date and time the password in DbPassword expires.
