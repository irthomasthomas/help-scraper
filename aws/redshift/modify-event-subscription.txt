OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  modified Amazon Redshift event notification sub-
          scription.

       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SNS topic to be  used  by  the
          event notification subscription.

       --source-type (string)
          The  type of source that will be generating the events. For example,
          if you want to be notified of events generated  by  a  cluster,  you
          would set this parameter to cluster. If this value is not specified,
          events are returned for all Amazon Redshift objects in  your  Amazon
          Web  Services  account.  You  must specify a source type in order to
          specify source IDs.

          Valid  values:   cluster,   cluster-parameter-group,   cluster-secu-
          rity-group, cluster-snapshot, and scheduled-action.

       --source-ids (list)
          A list of one or more identifiers of Amazon Redshift source objects.
          All of the objects must be of the same type as was specified in  the
          source  type  parameter.  The  event  subscription  will return only
          events generated by the specified objects. If  not  specified,  then
          events  are  returned  for all objects within the source type speci-
          fied.

          Example: my-cluster-1, my-cluster-2

          Example: my-snapshot-20131010

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --event-categories (list)
          Specifies the Amazon Redshift event categories to  be  published  by
          the event notification subscription.

          Values: configuration, management, monitoring, security, pending

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --severity (string)
          Specifies  the Amazon Redshift event severity to be published by the
          event notification subscription.

          Values: ERROR, INFO

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          A Boolean value indicating if the subscription is enabled. true  in-
          dicates the subscription is enabled

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
