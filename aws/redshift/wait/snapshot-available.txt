SNAPSHOT-AVAILABLE()                                      SNAPSHOT-AVAILABLE()



NAME
       snapshot-available -

DESCRIPTION
       Wait  until JMESPath query Snapshots[].Status returns available for all
       elements when polling with describe-cluster-snapshots. It will poll ev-
       ery  15  seconds  until  a successful state has been reached. This will
       exit with a return code of 255 after 20 failed checks.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       snapshot-available is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Snapshots

OPTIONS
       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  of  the cluster which generated the requested snap-
          shots.

       --snapshot-identifier (string)
          The snapshot identifier of the snapshot about which to return infor-
          mation.

       --snapshot-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the snapshot associated with the
          message to describe cluster snapshots.

       --snapshot-type (string)
          The type of snapshots for which you are requesting  information.  By
          default, snapshots of all types are returned.

          Valid Values: automated | manual

       --start-time (timestamp)
          A  value that requests only snapshots created at or after the speci-
          fied time. The time value is specified in ISO 8601 format. For  more
          information about ISO 8601, go to the ISO8601 Wikipedia page.

          Example: 2012-07-16T18:00:00Z

       --end-time (timestamp)
          A  time  value that requests only snapshots created at or before the
          specified time. The time value is specified in ISO 8601 format.  For
          more information about ISO 8601, go to the ISO8601 Wikipedia page.

          Example: 2012-07-16T18:00:00Z

       --owner-account (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account used to create or copy the snapshot.
          Use this field to filter the results to snapshots owned by a partic-
          ular  account.  To  describe  snapshots you own, either specify your
          Amazon Web Services account, or do not specify the parameter.

       --tag-keys (list)
          A tag key or keys for which you want to return all matching  cluster
          snapshots  that  are  associated with the specified key or keys. For
          example, suppose that you have snapshots that are tagged  with  keys
          called owner and environment . If you specify both of these tag keys
          in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response  with  the  snap-
          shots  that  have  either  or both of these tag keys associated with
          them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tag-values (list)
          A tag value or values for which you  want  to  return  all  matching
          cluster  snapshots  that are associated with the specified tag value
          or values. For example, suppose that you  have  snapshots  that  are
          tagged  with  values  called admin and test . If you specify both of
          these tag values in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a  response
          with  the snapshots that have either or both of these tag values as-
          sociated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cluster-exists | --no-cluster-exists (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to return snapshots only for  an  ex-
          isting  cluster. You can perform table-level restore only by using a
          snapshot of an existing cluster, that is, a  cluster  that  has  not
          been deleted. Values for this parameter work as follows:

          o If ClusterExists is set to true , ClusterIdentifier is required.

          o If ClusterExists is set to false and ClusterIdentifier isn't spec-
            ified, all snapshots associated with  deleted  clusters  (orphaned
            snapshots) are returned.

          o If  ClusterExists  is set to false and ClusterIdentifier is speci-
            fied for a deleted cluster, snapshots associated with that cluster
            are returned.

          o If  ClusterExists  is set to false and ClusterIdentifier is speci-
            fied for an existing cluster, no snapshots are returned.

       --sorting-entities (list)
          (structure)
              Describes a sorting entity

              Attribute -> (string)
                 The category for sorting the snapshots.

              SortOrder -> (string)
                 The order for listing the attributes.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Attribute=string,SortOrder=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Attribute": "SOURCE_TYPE"|"TOTAL_SIZE"|"CREATE_TIME",
              "SortOrder": "ASC"|"DESC"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To wait for snapshot to become available

       The following wait snapshot-available example pauses and continues only
       after it can confirm that the specified snapshot is available.

          aws redshift wait snapshot-available \
              --snapshot-identifier mycluster-2019-11-06-16-31

       This command does not produce any output.

OUTPUT
       None
