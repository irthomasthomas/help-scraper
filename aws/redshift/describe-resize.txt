DESCRIBE-RESIZE()                                            DESCRIBE-RESIZE()



NAME
       describe-resize -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about the last resize operation for the specified
       cluster. If no resize operation has ever been initiated for the  speci-
       fied  cluster,  a HTTP 404 error is returned. If a resize operation was
       initiated and completed, the status of the resize remains as  SUCCEEDED
       until the next resize.

       A resize operation can be requested using  ModifyCluster and specifying
       a different number or type of nodes for the cluster.

OPTIONS
       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The unique identifier of a cluster whose resize progress you are re-
          questing. This parameter is case-sensitive.

          By default, resize operations for all clusters defined for an Amazon
          Web Services account are returned.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

   Describe Resize
       This  example describes the latest resize of a cluster. The request was
       for 3 nodes of type dw.hs1.8xlarge.

       Command:

          aws redshift describe-resize --cluster-identifier mycluster

       Result:

          {
             "Status": "NONE",
             "TargetClusterType": "multi-node",
             "TargetNodeType": "dw.hs1.8xlarge",
             "ResponseMetadata": {
                "RequestId": "9f52b0b4-7733-11e2-aa9b-318b2909bd27"
             },
             "TargetNumberOfNodes": "3"
          }

OUTPUT
       TargetNodeType -> (string)
          The node type that the cluster will have after the resize  operation
          is complete.

       TargetNumberOfNodes -> (integer)
          The  number of nodes that the cluster will have after the resize op-
          eration is complete.

       TargetClusterType -> (string)
          The cluster type after the resize operation is complete.

          Valid Values: multi-node | single-node

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the resize operation.

          Valid Values: NONE | IN_PROGRESS | FAILED | SUCCEEDED | CANCELLING

       ImportTablesCompleted -> (list)
          The names of tables that have been completely imported .

          Valid Values: List of table names.

          (string)

       ImportTablesInProgress -> (list)
          The names of tables that are being currently imported.

          Valid Values: List of table names.

          (string)

       ImportTablesNotStarted -> (list)
          The names of tables that have not been yet imported.

          Valid Values: List of table names

          (string)

       AvgResizeRateInMegaBytesPerSecond -> (double)
          The average rate of the resize operation over the last few  minutes,
          measured  in  megabytes  per second. After the resize operation com-
          pletes, this value shows the average rate of the entire resize oper-
          ation.

       TotalResizeDataInMegaBytes -> (long)
          The estimated total amount of data, in megabytes, on the cluster be-
          fore the resize operation began.

       ProgressInMegaBytes -> (long)
          While the resize operation is in progress, this value shows the cur-
          rent  amount  of data, in megabytes, that has been processed so far.
          When the resize operation is complete, this value  shows  the  total
          amount  of  data, in megabytes, on the cluster, which may be more or
          less than TotalResizeDataInMegaBytes (the estimated total amount  of
          data before resize).

       ElapsedTimeInSeconds -> (long)
          The  amount  of seconds that have elapsed since the resize operation
          began. After the resize operation completes, this  value  shows  the
          total actual time, in seconds, for the resize operation.

       EstimatedTimeToCompletionInSeconds -> (long)
          The estimated time remaining, in seconds, until the resize operation
          is complete. This value is calculated based on  the  average  resize
          rate  and  the  estimated  amount of data remaining to be processed.
          Once the resize operation is complete, this value will be 0.

       ResizeType -> (string)
          An enum with possible values of ClassicResize  and  ElasticResize  .
          These values describe the type of resize operation being performed.

       Message -> (string)
          An  optional  string  to provide additional details about the resize
          action.

       TargetEncryptionType -> (string)
          The type of encryption for the cluster after the resize is complete.

          Possible values are KMS and None .

       DataTransferProgressPercent -> (double)
          The percent of data transferred from source cluster to target  clus-
          ter.
