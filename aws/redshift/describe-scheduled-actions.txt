NAME
       describe-scheduled-actions -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes properties of scheduled actions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-scheduled-actions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: ScheduledActions

OPTIONS
       --scheduled-action-name (string)
          The name of the scheduled action to retrieve.

       --target-action-type (string)
          The type of the scheduled actions to retrieve.

          Possible values:

          o ResizeCluster

          o PauseCluster

          o ResumeCluster

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start time in UTC of the scheduled actions to retrieve. Only ac-
          tive scheduled actions that have invocations after this time are re-
          trieved.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end time in UTC of the scheduled action to retrieve. Only active
          scheduled  actions  that  have  invocations before this time are re-
          trieved.

       --active | --no-active (boolean)
          If true, retrieve only active scheduled actions. If false,  retrieve
          only disabled scheduled actions.

       --filters (list)
          List of scheduled action filters.

          (structure)
              A set of elements to filter the returned scheduled actions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The type of element to filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 List of values. Compare if the value (of type defined by Name
                 ) equals an item in the list of scheduled actions.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "cluster-identifier"|"iam-role",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe scheduled actions

       The following describe-scheduled-actions example displays  details  for
       any currently scheduled actions.

          aws redshift describe-scheduled-actions

       Output:

          {
              "ScheduledActions": [
                  {
                      "ScheduledActionName": "resizecluster",
                      "TargetAction": {
                          "ResizeCluster": {
                              "ClusterIdentifier": "mycluster",
                              "NumberOfNodes": 4,
                              "Classic": false
                          }
                      },
                      "Schedule": "at(2019-12-10T00:07:00)",
                      "IamRole": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/myRedshiftRole",
                      "State": "ACTIVE",
                      "NextInvocations": [
                          "2019-12-10T00:07:00Z"
                      ]
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An  optional parameter that specifies the starting point to return a
          set of response records. When the results of a  DescribeScheduledAc-
          tions  request exceed the value specified in MaxRecords , Amazon Web
          Services returns a value in the Marker field of  the  response.  You
          can  retrieve  the next set of response records by providing the re-
          turned marker value in the Marker parameter  and  retrying  the  re-
          quest.

       ScheduledActions -> (list)
          List of retrieved scheduled actions.

          (structure)
              Describes  a scheduled action. You can use a scheduled action to
              trigger some Amazon Redshift API operations on a  schedule.  For
              information  about  which  API  operations can be scheduled, see
              ScheduledActionType .

                 The name of the scheduled action.

              TargetAction -> (structure)
                 A JSON format string of the  Amazon  Redshift  API  operation
                 with input parameters.

                 "{\"ResizeCluster\":{\"NodeType\":\"ra3.4xlarge\",\"ClusterI-

                     ClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                        The unique identifier for the cluster to resize.

                     ClusterType -> (string)
                        The new cluster type for the specified cluster.

                     NodeType -> (string)
                        The new node type for the nodes you are adding. If not
                        specified, the cluster's current node type is used.

                     NumberOfNodes -> (integer)
                        The new number of nodes for the cluster. If not speci-
                        fied, the cluster's current number of nodes is used.

                     Classic -> (boolean)
                        A boolean value indicating whether the  resize  opera-
                        tion is using the classic resize process. If you don't
                        provide this parameter or set the value to false , the
                        resize type is elastic.

                     ReservedNodeId -> (string)
                        The identifier of the reserved node.

                     TargetReservedNodeOfferingId -> (string)

                 The  schedule  for  a one-time (at format) or recurring (cron
                 format) scheduled action. Schedule invocations must be  sepa-
                 rated by at least one hour.

                 Format  of  at expressions is "at(yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss) ". For
                 example, "at(2016-03-04T17:27:00) ".

                 Format   of   cron   expressions   is   "cron(Minutes   Hours
                 Day-of-month  Month Day-of-week Year) ". For example, "cron(0

                 role must have permission to run the Amazon Redshift API  op-
                 eration in the scheduled action. This IAM role must allow the
                 Amazon Redshift scheduler (Principal  scheduler.redshift.ama-
                 zonaws.com)  to  assume  permissions on your behalf. For more
                 information about the IAM role to use with  the  Amazon  Red-
                 shift scheduler, see Using Identity-Based Policies for Amazon
                 Redshift in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide .

                 (timestamp)

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The start time in UTC when the  schedule  is  active.  Before
                 this time, the scheduled action does not trigger.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  end  time  in UTC when the schedule is no longer active.
                 After this time, the scheduled action does not trigger.
