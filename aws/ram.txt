DESCRIPTION
       This  is the Resource Access Manager API Reference . This documentation
       provides descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types
       in  RAM. RAM is a service that helps you securely share your Amazon Web
       Services resources to other Amazon Web Services accounts.  If  you  use
       Organizations  to  manage  your  accounts,  then you can share your re-
       sources with your entire organization or to organizational units (OUs).
       For  supported  resource types, you can also share resources with indi-
       vidual Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and users.
