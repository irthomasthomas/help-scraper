CREATE-SLOT-TYPE-VERSION()                          CREATE-SLOT-TYPE-VERSION()



NAME
       create-slot-type-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new  version of a slot type based on the $LATEST version of
       the specified slot type. If the $LATEST version of  this  resource  has
       not changed since the last version that you created, Amazon Lex doesn't
       create a new version. It returns the last version that you created.

       NOTE:
          You can update only the $LATEST version of a slot  type.  You  can't
          update  the  numbered  versions that you create with the CreateSlot-
          TypeVersion operation.

       When you create a version of a slot type, Amazon Lex sets  the  version
       to  1.  Subsequent  versions  increment by 1. For more information, see
       versioning-intro .

       This operation requires permissions for  the  lex:CreateSlotTypeVersion
       action.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the slot type that you want to create a new version for.
          The name is case sensitive.

       --checksum (string)
          Checksum for the $LATEST version of the slot type that you  want  to
          publish.  If  you  specify a checksum and the $LATEST version of the
          slot type has a different checksum, Amazon Lex returns  a  Precondi-
          tionFailedException  exception  and doesn't publish the new version.
          If you don't specify a checksum, Amazon Lex  publishes  the  $LATEST
          version.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       name -> (string)
          The name of the slot type.

       description -> (string)
          A description of the slot type.

       enumerationValues -> (list)
          A  list of EnumerationValue objects that defines the values that the
          slot type can take.

          (structure)
              Each slot type can have a set of values. Each enumeration  value
              represents a value the slot type can take.

              For  example,  a  pizza ordering bot could have a slot type that
              specifies the type of crust that the pizza should have. The slot
              type could include the values

              o thick

              o thin

              o stuffed

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the slot type.

              synonyms -> (list)
                 Additional values related to the slot type value.

                 (string)

       lastUpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
          The date that the slot type was updated. When you create a resource,
          the creation date and last update date are the same.

       createdDate -> (timestamp)
          The date that the slot type was created.

       version -> (string)
          The version assigned to the new slot type version.

          The built-in slot type used a the parent of the slot type.

       slotTypeConfigurations -> (list)
          Configuration  information  that  extends  the  parent built-in slot
          type.

          (structure)
              Provides configuration information for a slot type.

              regexConfiguration -> (structure)
                 A regular expression used to validate the value of a slot.

                 pattern -> (string)
                     A regular expression used to  validate  the  value  of  a
                     slot.

                     the following characters in the regular expression:

                     o A-Z, a-z

                     o 0-9

                     o Unicode characters ("u<Unicode>")

                     Represent Unicode characters with four digits, for  exam-
                     ple "u0041" or "u005A".

                     The  following  regular expression operators are not sup-
