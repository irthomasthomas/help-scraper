OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the bot. The name is case sensitive.

       --version-or-alias (string)
          The version or alias of the bot.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.
