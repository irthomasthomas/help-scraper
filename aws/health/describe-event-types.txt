DESCRIBE-EVENT-TYPES()                                  DESCRIBE-EVENT-TYPES()



NAME
       describe-event-types -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  event  types that meet the specified filter criteria. You
       can use this API operation to find information about the Health  event,
       such  as the category, Amazon Web Service, and event code. The metadata
       for each event appears in the EventType object.

       If you don't specify a filter criteria, the API operation  returns  all
       event types, in no particular order.

       NOTE:
          This  API operation uses pagination. Specify the nextToken parameter
          in the next request to return more results.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-event-types is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: eventTypes

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Values to narrow the results returned.

          eventTypeCodes -> (list)
              A list of event type codes.

              (string)

          services -> (list)
              The  Amazon Web Services associated with the event. For example,
              EC2 , RDS .

              (string)

          eventTypeCategories -> (list)
              A list of event type category codes. Possible values are issue ,
              accountNotification , or scheduledChange . Currently, the inves-
              tigation value isn't supported at this time.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          eventTypeCodes=string,string,services=string,string,eventTypeCategories=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "eventTypeCodes": ["string", ...],
            "services": ["string", ...],
            "eventTypeCategories": ["issue"|"accountNotification"|"scheduledChange"|"investigation", ...]
          }

       --locale (string)
          The locale (language) to return information in. English (en) is  the
          default and the only supported value at this time.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       eventTypes -> (list)
          A list of event types that match the filter  criteria.  Event  types
          have a category (issue , accountNotification , or scheduledChange ),
          a service (for example, EC2 , RDS , DATAPIPELINE , BILLING ), and  a
          code  (in  the format AWS_*SERVICE* _*DESCRIPTION* `` ; for example,
          ``AWS_EC2_SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE_EVENT ).

          (structure)
              Contains the metadata about a type of event that is reported  by
              Health. The EventType shows the category, service, and the event
              type code of the event. For example, an issue might be the cate-
              gory,  EC2 the service, and AWS_EC2_SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE_EVENT the
              event type code.

              You can use the DescribeEventTypes API operation to return  this
              information about an event.

              You  can also use the Amazon CloudWatch Events console to create
              a rule so that you can get notified or take action  when  Health
              delivers  a  specific event to your Amazon Web Services account.
              For more information, see Monitor for Health events with  Amazon
              CloudWatch Events in the Health User Guide .

              service -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Service that is affected by the event. For ex-
                 ample, EC2 , RDS .

              code -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for  the  event  type.  The  format  is
                 AWS_*SERVICE* _*DESCRIPTION* `` ; for example, ``AWS_EC2_SYS-
                 TEM_MAINTENANCE_EVENT .

              category -> (string)
                 A list of event type category codes. Possible values are  is-
                 sue  ,  accountNotification , or scheduledChange . Currently,
                 the investigation value isn't supported at this time.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If the results of a search are large, only a portion of the  results
          are  returned,  and  a nextToken pagination token is returned in the
          response. To retrieve the next batch of results, reissue the  search
          request  and  include the returned token. When all results have been
          returned, the response does not contain a pagination token value.
