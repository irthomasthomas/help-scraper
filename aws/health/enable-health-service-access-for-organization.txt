ENABLE-HEALTH-SERVICE-ACCESS-FOENABLE-HEALTH-SERVICE-ACCESS-FOR-ORGANIZATION()



NAME
       enable-health-service-access-for-organization -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables  Health  to  work with Organizations. You can use the organiza-
       tional view feature to aggregate events from all  Amazon  Web  Services
       accounts in your organization in a centralized location.

       This  operation  also  creates a service-linked role for the management
       account in the organization.

       NOTE:
          To call this operation, you must meet the following requirements:

          o You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or  Enterprise  Sup-
            port  plan from Amazon Web Services Support to use the Health API.
            If you call the Health API from an  Amazon  Web  Services  account
            that  doesn't  have  a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise
            Support plan, you receive a SubscriptionRequiredException error.

          o You must have permission to call this operation from the organiza-
            tion's  management  account.  For example IAM policies, see Health
            identity-based policy examples .

       If you don't have the required support plan, you can  instead  use  the
       Health  console to enable the organizational view feature. For more in-
       formation, see Aggregating Health events in the Health User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
