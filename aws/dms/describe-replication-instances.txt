NAME
       describe-replication-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about replication instances for your account in the
       current region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-replication-instances is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: ReplicationInstances

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Filters applied to replication instances.

          Valid   filter  names:  replication-instance-arn  |  replication-in-
          stance-id | replication-instance-class | engine-version

          (structure)
              Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is
              used  to  limit  the number and type of DMS objects that are re-
              turned for a particular Describe*  call  or  similar  operation.
              Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API opera-
              tions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter as specified for a Describe* or  simi-
                 lar operation.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  value, which can specify one or more values used
                 to narrow the returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       ReplicationInstances -> (list)
          The replication instances described.

          (structure)
              Provides information that defines a replication instance.

              ReplicationInstanceIdentifier -> (string)
                 The  replication instance identifier is a required parameter.
                 This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

              EngineVersion -> (string)
                 The engine version number of the replication instance.

                 If an engine version number is not specified when a  replica-
                 tion  instance  is  created, the default is the latest engine
                 version available.

                 When modifying a major engine version of  an  instance,  also
                 set AllowMajorVersionUpgrade to true .

              AutoMinorVersionUpgrade -> (boolean)
                 Boolean  value  indicating  if minor version upgrades will be
                 automatically applied to the instance.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 An KMS key identifier that is used to encrypt the data on the
                 replication instance.

                 If you don't specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, then
                 DMS uses your default encryption key.

                 KMS creates the default encryption key for  your  Amazon  Web
                 Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a dif-
                 ferent default encryption key for each  Amazon  Web  Services
                 Region.

              ReplicationInstanceArn -> (string)

                 (string)

              PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
                 Specifies the accessibility options for the  replication  in-
                 stance.  A value of true represents an instance with a public
                 IP address. A value of false represents an  instance  with  a
                 private IP address. The default value is true .

              SecondaryAvailabilityZone -> (string)
                 The  Availability Zone of the standby replication instance in
                 a Multi-AZ deployment.

              FreeUntil -> (timestamp)

                 to access your on-premise source or target database.

              NetworkType -> (string)
                 The type of IP address protocol used  by  a  replication  in-
                 stance,  such  as  IPv4 only or Dual-stack that supports both
                 IPv4 and IPv6 addressing. IPv6 only is not yet supported.
