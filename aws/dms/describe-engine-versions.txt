OPTIONS
       --max-records (integer)
          The maximum number of records to include in the  response.  If  more
          records  exist than the specified MaxRecords value, a pagination to-
          ken called a marker is included in the response so that the  remain-
          ing results can be retrieved.

       --marker (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       EngineVersions -> (list)
          Returned  EngineVersion  objects  that  describe the replication in-
          stance engine versions used in the project.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a replication instance version.

              Version -> (string)
                 The version number of the replication instance.

              Lifecycle -> (string)
                 The lifecycle status of  the  replication  instance  version.
                 Valid values are DEPRECATED , DEFAULT_VERSION , and ACTIVE .

              ReleaseStatus -> (string)
                 The release status of the replication instance version.

              LaunchDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  when  the replication instance version became pub-
                 licly available.

              AutoUpgradeDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date when the replication instance will be  automatically
                 upgraded. This setting only applies if the auto-minor-version
                 setting is enabled.

              DeprecationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date when the replication instance version will be depre-
                 cated and can no longer be requested.

              ForceUpgradeDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  when  the replication instance will have a version
                 upgrade forced.

              AvailableUpgrades -> (list)
                 The list of valid replication instance versions that you  can
                 upgrade to.

                 (string)

       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
