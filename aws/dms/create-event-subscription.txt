CREATE-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTION()                        CREATE-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTION()



NAME
       create-event-subscription -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an DMS event notification subscription.

       You  can  specify the type of source (SourceType ) you want to be noti-
       fied of, provide a list of DMS source IDs (SourceIds  )  that  triggers
       the  events,  and provide a list of event categories (EventCategories )
       for events you want to be notified of. If you specify both the  Source-
       Type  and  SourceIds  ,  such  as SourceType = replication-instance and
       SourceIdentifier = my-replinstance , you will be notified  of  all  the
       replication  instance events for the specified source. If you specify a
       SourceType but don't specify a SourceIdentifier , you receive notice of
       the  events for that source type for all your DMS sources. If you don't
       specify either SourceType nor SourceIdentifier , you will  be  notified
       of events generated from all DMS sources belonging to your customer ac-
       count.

       For more information about DMS events, see Working with Events and  No-
       tifications in the Database Migration Service User Guide.

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The  name of the DMS event notification subscription. This name must
          be less than 255 characters.

       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic  created  for
          event notification. The ARN is created by Amazon SNS when you create
          a topic and subscribe to it.

       --source-type (string)
          The type of DMS resource that generates the events. For example,  if
          you  want  to  be  notified of events generated by a replication in-
          stance, you set this parameter to  replication-instance  .  If  this
          value isn't specified, all events are returned.

          Valid values: replication-instance | replication-task

       --event-categories (list)
          A  list  of event categories for a source type that you want to sub-
          scribe to. For more information, see Working with Events and Notifi-
          cations in the Database Migration Service User Guide.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --source-ids (list)
          A list of identifiers for which DMS provides notification events.

          If  you  don't  specify  a value, notifications are provided for all
          sources.

          If you specify multiple values, they must be of the same  type.  For
          example,  if  you  specify  a  database instance ID, then all of the
          other values must be database instance IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          A Boolean value; set to true to activate the subscription, or set to
          false to create the subscription but not activate it.

       --tags (list)
          One or more tags to be assigned to the event subscription.

          (structure)
              A  user-defined  key-value pair that describes metadata added to
              an DMS resource and that is used by operations such as the  fol-
              lowing:

              o AddTagsToResource

              o ListTagsForResource

              o RemoveTagsFromResource

              Key -> (string)
                 A  key  is the required name of the tag. The string value can
                 be 1-128 Unicode characters in length and can't  be  prefixed
                 with  "aws:"  or "dms:". The string can only contain only the
                 set of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_',  '.',  '/',
                 '=',      '+',     '-'     (Java     regular     expressions:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A value is the optional value of the tag.  The  string  value
                 can  be  1-256 Unicode characters in length and can't be pre-
                 fixed with "aws:" or "dms:". The string can only contain only
                 the  set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.',
                 '/',   '=',   '+',    '-'    (Java    regular    expressions:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) string that uniquely identi-
                 fies the resource for which the tag is created.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,ResourceArn=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "ResourceArn": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list event subscriptions

       The following create-event-subscription example creates an  event  sub-
       scription to an Amazon SNS topic (my-sns-topic).

          aws dms create-event-subscription \
              --subscription-name my-dms-events \
              --sns-topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-sns-topic

       Output:

          {
              "EventSubscription": {
                  "CustomerAwsId": "123456789012",
                  "CustSubscriptionId": "my-dms-events",
                  "SnsTopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-sns-topic",
                  "Status": "creating",
                  "SubscriptionCreationTime": "2020-05-21 21:58:38.598",
                  "Enabled": true
              }
          }
