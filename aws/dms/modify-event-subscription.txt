OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The name of the DMS event notification subscription to be modified.

       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic created for
          event notification. The ARN is created by Amazon SNS when you create
          a topic and subscribe to it.

       --source-type (string)
          The  type of DMS resource that generates the events you want to sub-
          scribe to.

          Valid values: replication-instance | replication-task

       --event-categories (list)
          A list of event categories for a source type that you want  to  sub-
          scribe  to.  Use the DescribeEventCategories action to see a list of
          event categories.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          A Boolean value; set to true to activate the subscription.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To modify an event subscription

       The following modify-event-subscription example changes the source type
       of an event subscription.

          aws dms modify-event-subscription \
              --subscription-name "my-dms-events" \
              --source-type replication-task

       Output:

          {
              "EventSubscription": {
                  "CustomerAwsId": "123456789012",
                  "CustSubscriptionId": "my-dms-events",
                  "SnsTopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-sns-topic",
                  "Status": "modifying",
                  "SubscriptionCreationTime": "2020-05-29 17:04:40.262",
                  "SourceType": "replication-task",
                  "Enabled": true
              }
          }

          SourceIdsList -> (list)
              A list of source Ids for the event subscription.

              (string)
