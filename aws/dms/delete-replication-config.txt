DELETE-REPLICATION-CONFIG()                        DELETE-REPLICATION-CONFIG()



NAME
       delete-replication-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  an  DMS Serverless replication configuration. This effectively
       deprovisions any and all replications that use this configuration.  You
       can't  delete  the configuration for an DMS Serverless replication that
       is ongoing. You can delete the configuration when the replication is in
       a non-RUNNING and non-STARTING state.

OPTIONS
       --replication-config-arn (string)
          The replication config to delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ReplicationConfig -> (structure)
          Configuration parameters returned for the DMS Serverless replication
          after it is deleted.

          ReplicationConfigIdentifier -> (string)
              The  identifier  for  the  ReplicationConfig associated with the
              replication.

          ReplicationConfigArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this DMS  Serverless  replica-
              tion configuration.

          SourceEndpointArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the source endpoint for this
              DMS serverless replication configuration.

          TargetEndpointArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target endpoint  for  this
              DMS serverless replication configuration.

          ReplicationType -> (string)
              The type of the replication.

          ComputeConfig -> (structure)
              Configuration  parameters  for  provisioning  an  DMS serverless
              replication.

              AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                 The Availability Zone where the  DMS  Serverless  replication
                 using  this  configuration  will  run. The default value is a
                 random, system-chosen Availability  Zone  in  the  configura-
                 tion's Amazon Web Services Region, for example, "us-west-2" .
                 You can't set this parameter if the MultiAZ parameter is  set
                 to true .

              DnsNameServers -> (string)
                 A  list  of  custom  DNS  name  servers supported for the DMS
                 Serverless replication to access your source or target  data-
                 base.  This list overrides the default name servers supported
                 by  the  DMS  Serverless  replication.  You  can  specify   a
                 comma-separated list of internet addresses for up to four DNS
                 name servers. For example: "1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2,3.3.3.3,4.4.4.4"

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 An Key Management Service  (KMS)  key  Amazon  Resource  Name
                 (ARN)  that is used to encrypt the data during DMS Serverless
                 replication.

                 If you don't specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter,  DMS
                 uses your default encryption key.

                 KMS  creates  the  default encryption key for your Amazon Web
                 Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a dif-
                 ferent  default  encryption  key for each Amazon Web Services
                 Region.

              MaxCapacityUnits -> (integer)
                 Specifies the maximum value of the DMS capacity units  (DCUs)
                 for  which  a  given DMS Serverless replication can be provi-
                 sioned. A single DCU is 2GB of RAM, with 1 DCU as the minimum
                 value allowed. The list of valid DCU values includes 1, 2, 4,
                 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 192, 256, and 384. So, the maximum  value
                 that you can specify for DMS Serverless is 384. The MaxCapac-
                 ityUnits parameter is the only DCU parameter you are required
                 to specify.

              MinCapacityUnits -> (integer)
                 Specifies  the minimum value of the DMS capacity units (DCUs)
                 for which a given DMS Serverless replication  can  be  provi-
                 sioned. A single DCU is 2GB of RAM, with 1 DCU as the minimum
                 value allowed. The list of valid DCU values includes 1, 2, 4,
                 8,  16,  32,  64, 128, 192, 256, and 384. So, the minimum DCU
                 value that you can specify for DMS Serverless is 1. You don't
                 have  to  specify a value for the MinCapacityUnits parameter.
                 If you don't set this value, DMS scans the  current  activity
                 of available source tables to identify an optimum setting for
                 this parameter. If there is no current source activity or DMS
                 can't  otherwise  identify  a more appropriate value, it sets
                 this parameter to the minimum DCU value allowed, 1.

              MultiAZ -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  the  DMS  Serverless  replication  is   a
                 Multi-AZ  deployment.  You can't set the AvailabilityZone pa-
                 rameter if the MultiAZ parameter is set to true .

              PreferredMaintenanceWindow -> (string)
                 The weekly time range during which system maintenance can oc-
                 cur  for the DMS Serverless replication, in Universal Coordi-
                 nated Time (UTC). The format is ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi .

                 The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from  an
                 8-hour  block  of  time  per Amazon Web Services Region. This
                 maintenance occurs on a random day of the week. Valid  values
                 for  days  of  the week include Mon , Tue , Wed , Thu , Fri ,
                 Sat , and Sun .

                 Constraints include a minimum 30-minute window.

              ReplicationSubnetGroupId -> (string)
                 Specifies a subnet group identifier to associate with the DMS
                 Serverless replication.

              VpcSecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                 Specifies  the  virtual private cloud (VPC) security group to
                 use with the DMS Serverless  replication.  The  VPC  security
                 group must work with the VPC containing the replication.

                 (string)

          ReplicationSettings -> (string)
              Configuration parameters for an DMS serverless replication.

          SupplementalSettings -> (string)
              Additional parameters for an DMS serverless replication.

          TableMappings -> (string)
              Table mappings specified in the replication.

          ReplicationConfigCreateTime -> (timestamp)
              The time the serverless replication config was created.

          ReplicationConfigUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
              The time the serverless replication config was updated.
