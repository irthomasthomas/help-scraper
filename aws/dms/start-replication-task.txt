OPTIONS
       --replication-task-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  replication  task  to  be
          started.

       --start-replication-task-type (string)
          The type of replication task to start.

          When the migration type is full-load or full-load-and-cdc , the only
          valid value for the first run of the  task  is  start-replication  .
          This option will start the migration.

          You can also use  ReloadTables to reload specific tables that failed
          during migration instead of restarting the task.

          The resume-processing option isn't applicable for a full-load  task,
          because  you  can't  resume  partially loaded tables during the full
          load phase.

          For a full-load-and-cdc task, DMS migrates table data, and then  ap-
          plies  data changes that occur on the source. To load all the tables
          again, and start capturing source changes, use reload-target .  Oth-
          erwise  use  resume-processing  ,  to replicate the changes from the
          last stop position.

          Possible values:

          o start-replication

          o resume-processing

          o reload-target

       --cdc-start-time (timestamp)
          Indicates the start time for a change data capture (CDC)  operation.
          Use either CdcStartTime or CdcStartPosition to specify when you want
          a CDC operation to start. Specifying both values results in  an  er-
          ror.

          Timestamp Example: --cdc-start-time 2018-03-08T12:12:12

       --cdc-start-position (string)
          Indicates  when  you  want  a change data capture (CDC) operation to
          start. Use either CdcStartPosition or CdcStartTime to  specify  when
          you want a CDC operation to start. Specifying both values results in
          an error.

          The value can be in date, checkpoint, or LSN/SCN format.

          Date Example: --cdc-start-position 2018-03-08T12:12:12

          Checkpoint       Example:        --cdc-start-position        "check-
          point:V1#27#mysql-bin-changelog.157832:1975:-1:2002:677883278264080:mysql-bin-changelog.157832:1876#0#0#*#0#93"

          LSN Example: --cdc-start-position mysql-bin-changelog.000024:373

          NOTE:
              When you use this task setting with a  source  PostgreSQL  data-
              base,  a  logical replication slot should already be created and
              associated with the source endpoint. You can verify this by set-
              ting the slotName extra connection attribute to the name of this
              logical replication slot. For more information, see  Extra  Con-
              nection Attributes When Using PostgreSQL as a Source for DMS .

       --cdc-stop-position (string)
          Indicates  when  you  want  a change data capture (CDC) operation to
          stop. The value can be either server time or commit time.

          Server          time          example:           --cdc-stop-position
          server_time:2018-02-09T12:12:12

          Commit       time       example:       --cdc-stop-position      com-
          mit_time:2018-02-09T12:12:12

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessment.html`__
                 operation assesses data type compatibility only  between  the
                 source and target database of a given migration task. In con-
                 trast,          `           StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun.html`__
                 enables you to specify a variety of premigration task assess-
                 ments  in  addition to data type compatibility. These assess-
                 ments include ones for the validity of  primary  key  defini-
                 tions  and likely issues with database migration performance,
                 among others.

          LastFailureMessage -> (string)
              The last error (failure) message generated for  the  replication
              task.

          StopReason -> (string)
              The  reason  the replication task was stopped. This response pa-
              rameter can return one of the following values:

              o "Stop Reason NORMAL"

              o "Stop Reason RECOVERABLE_ERROR"

              o "Stop Reason FATAL_ERROR"

              The date the replication task is scheduled to start.

          CdcStartPosition -> (string)
              Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation to
              start. Use either CdcStartPosition or  CdcStartTime  to  specify
              when you want the CDC operation to start. Specifying both values
              results in an error.

              The value can be in date, checkpoint, or LSN/SCN format.

              Date Example: --cdc-start-position 2018-03-08T12:12:12
