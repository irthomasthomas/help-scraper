NAME
       create-replication-subnet-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a replication subnet group given a list of the subnet IDs in a
       VPC.

       The VPC needs to have at least one subnet in at least two  availability
       zones  in  the  Amazon  Web Services Region, otherwise the service will
       throw a ReplicationSubnetGroupDoesNotCoverEnoughAZs exception.

OPTIONS
       --replication-subnet-group-identifier (string)
          The name for the replication subnet group. This value is stored as a
          lowercase string.

          Constraints:  Must contain no more than 255 alphanumeric characters,
          periods, spaces, underscores, or hyphens. Must not be "default".

          Example: mySubnetgroup

       --replication-subnet-group-description (string)
          The description for the subnet group.

       --subnet-ids (list)
          One or more subnet IDs to be assigned to the subnet group.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          One or more tags to be assigned to the subnet group.

          (structure)
              A user-defined key-value pair that describes metadata  added  to
              an  DMS resource and that is used by operations such as the fol-
              lowing:

              o AddTagsToResource

              o ListTagsForResource

              o RemoveTagsFromResource

              Key -> (string)
                 A key is the required name of the tag. The string  value  can
                 be  1-128  Unicode characters in length and can't be prefixed
                 with "aws:" or "dms:". The string can only contain  only  the
                 set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.', '/',
                 '=',     '+',     '-'     (Java     regular      expressions:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be 1-256 Unicode characters in length and can't  be  pre-
                 fixed with "aws:" or "dms:". The string can only contain only
                 the set of Unicode letters, digits,  white-space,  '_',  '.',
                 '/',    '=',    '+',    '-'    (Java   regular   expressions:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) string that  uniquely  identi-
                 fies the resource for which the tag is created.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,ResourceArn=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "ResourceArn": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a subnet group

       The  following  create-replication-subnet-group example creates a group
       consisting of 3 subnets.

          aws dms create-replication-subnet-group \
              --replication-subnet-group-identifier my-subnet-group \
              --replication-subnet-group-description "my subnet group" \
              --subnet-ids subnet-da327bf6 subnet-bac383e0 subnet-d7c825e8

       Output:
