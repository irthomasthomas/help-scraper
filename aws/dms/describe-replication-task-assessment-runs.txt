NAME
       describe-replication-task-assessment-runs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a paginated list of premigration assessment runs based on fil-
       ter settings.

       These filter settings can specify a combination of premigration assess-
       ment  runs,  migration tasks, replication instances, and assessment run
       status values.

       NOTE:
          This operation doesn't return information about  individual  assess-
          ments. For this information, see the DescribeReplicationTaskIndivid-
          ualAssessments operation.

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Filters applied to the premigration assessment runs described in the
          form of key-value pairs.

          Valid  filter  names: replication-task-assessment-run-arn , replica-
          tion-task-arn , replication-instance-arn , status

          (structure)
              Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is
              used  to  limit  the number and type of DMS objects that are re-
              turned for a particular Describe*  call  or  similar  operation.
              Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API opera-
              tions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter as specified for a Describe* or  simi-
                 lar operation.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  value, which can specify one or more values used
                 to narrow the returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-records (integer)
          The maximum number of records to include in the  response.  If  more
          records  exist than the specified MaxRecords value, a pagination to-
          ken called a marker is included in the response so that the  remain-
          ing results can be retrieved.

       --marker (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          A pagination token returned for you to pass to a subsequent request.
          If you pass this token as the Marker value in a subsequent  request,
          the  response  includes  only  records  beyond the marker, up to the
          value specified in the request by MaxRecords .

                 assessment run.

              Status -> (string)
                 Assessment run status.

                 This status can have one of the following values:

                 o "cancelling"  The assessment run was canceled by  the  Can-
                   celReplicationTaskAssessmentRun operation.

                   vidual assessments ran (during running status).

                 o "invalid state"  The assessment run is in an unknown state.

                 o "passed"   All  individual  assessments have completed, and
                   none has a failed status.
