OPTIONS
       --replication-instance-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the DMS resource that the  pending
          maintenance action applies to.

       --apply-action (string)
          The pending maintenance action to apply to this resource.

          Valid values: os-upgrade , system-update , db-upgrade

       --opt-in-type (string)
          A  value  that  specifies  the  type of opt-in request, or undoes an
          opt-in request. You can't undo an opt-in request of type immediate .

          Valid values:

          o immediate - Apply the maintenance action immediately.

          o next-maintenance - Apply the maintenance action  during  the  next
            maintenance window for the resource.

          o undo-opt-in  -  Cancel  any  existing  next-maintenance opt-in re-
            quests.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ResourcePendingMaintenanceActions -> (structure)
          The DMS resource that the pending maintenance action will be applied
          to.

          ResourceIdentifier -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the DMS resource that the
              pending maintenance action applies  to.  For  information  about
              creating  an ARN, see Constructing an Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
              for DMS in the DMS documentation.

          PendingMaintenanceActionDetails -> (list)
              Detailed information about the pending maintenance action.

              (structure)
                 Describes a maintenance action pending for an  DMS  resource,
                 including  when and how it will be applied. This data type is
                 a response element to  the  DescribePendingMaintenanceActions
                 operation.

                 Action -> (string)
                     The  type of pending maintenance action that is available
                     for the resource.

                 AutoAppliedAfterDate -> (timestamp)
                     The date of the maintenance window when the action is  to
                     be  applied. The maintenance action is applied to the re-
                     source during its first  maintenance  window  after  this
                     date.  If  this  date  is specified, any next-maintenance
                     opt-in requests are ignored.

                 ForcedApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                     The date when the maintenance action  will  be  automati-
                     cally  applied.  The maintenance action is applied to the
                     resource on this date regardless of the maintenance  win-
                     dow  for the resource. If this date is specified, any im-
                     mediate opt-in requests are ignored.

                 OptInStatus -> (string)
                     The type of opt-in request that has been received for the
                     resource.

                 CurrentApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                     The  effective  date  when the pending maintenance action
                     will be applied to the resource. This date takes into ac-
                     count opt-in requests received from the ApplyPendingMain-
                     tenanceAction API operation, and also the  AutoAppliedAf-
                     terDate  and ForcedApplyDate parameter values. This value
                     is blank if an opt-in request has not been  received  and
                     nothing  has  been  specified for AutoAppliedAfterDate or
                     ForcedApplyDate .

                 Description -> (string)
                     A description providing more detail about the maintenance
                     action.
