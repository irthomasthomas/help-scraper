NAME
       describe-replication-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  replication  tasks for your account in the
       current region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-replication-tasks is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: ReplicationTasks

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Filters applied to replication tasks.

          Valid filter names: replication-task-arn | replication-task-id | mi-
          gration-type | endpoint-arn | replication-instance-arn

          (structure)
              Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is
              used  to  limit  the number and type of DMS objects that are re-
              turned for a particular Describe*  call  or  similar  operation.
              Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API opera-
              tions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter as specified for a Describe* or  simi-
                 lar operation.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  value, which can specify one or more values used
                 to narrow the returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --without-settings | --no-without-settings (boolean)
          An option to set to avoid returning information about settings.  Use
          this  to  reduce  overhead when setting information is too large. To
          use this option, choose true ;  otherwise,  choose  false  (the  de-
          fault).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                     `                       StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun.html`__
                     is  an  improved  premigration task assessment operation.
                     The           `            StartReplicationTaskAssessment
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessment.html`__
                     operation assesses data type compatibility  only  between
                     the source and target database of a given migration task.
                     In    contrast,    `    StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun.html`__
                     enables you to specify a variety of premigration task as-
                     sessments  in  addition to data type compatibility. These
                     assessments include ones for the validity of primary  key
                     definitions  and  likely  issues  with database migration
                     performance, among others.

              LastFailureMessage -> (string)
                 The last error (failure) message generated for  the  replica-
                 tion task.

              StopReason -> (string)
                 The  reason  the  replication task was stopped. This response
                 parameter can return one of the following values:

                 o "Stop Reason NORMAL"

                 o "Stop Reason RECOVERABLE_ERROR"

                 o "Stop Reason FATAL_ERROR"

                 o "Stop Reason FULL_LOAD_ONLY_FINISHED"

                 o "Stop Reason STOPPED_AFTER_FULL_LOAD"  Full load completed,
                   with cached changes not applied

                 o "Stop  Reason  STOPPED_AFTER_CACHED_EVENTS"  Full load com-
                   pleted, with cached changes applied

                 o "Stop Reason EXPRESS_LICENSE_LIMITS_REACHED"

                 o "Stop Reason  STOPPED_AFTER_DDL_APPLY"   User-defined  stop
                   task after DDL applied

                 o "Stop Reason STOPPED_DUE_TO_LOW_MEMORY"

                 o "Stop Reason STOPPED_DUE_TO_LOW_DISK"

                 o "Stop  Reason  STOPPED_AT_SERVER_TIME"  User-defined server
                   time for stopping task

              ReplicationTaskCreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the replication task was created.

              ReplicationTaskStartDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the replication task is scheduled to start.

              CdcStartPosition -> (string)
                 Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation
                 to start. Use  either  CdcStartPosition  or  CdcStartTime  to
                 specify  when you want the CDC operation to start. Specifying
                 both values results in an error.

                 The value can be in date, checkpoint, or LSN/SCN format.

                 Date Example: --cdc-start-position 2018-03-08T12:12:12

              CdcStopPosition -> (string)
                 Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation
                 to stop. The value can be either server time or commit time.

                 Server        time        example:        --cdc-stop-position
                 server_time:2018-02-09T12:12:12

                 Commit     time     example:     --cdc-stop-position     com-

              RecoveryCheckpoint -> (string)
                 Indicates the last checkpoint that occurred during  a  change
                 data  capture  (CDC) operation. You can provide this value to
                 the CdcStartPosition parameter to start a CDC operation  that
                 begins at that checkpoint.

              ReplicationTaskArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication task.

              ReplicationTaskStats -> (structure)
                 The  statistics  for the task, including elapsed time, tables
                 loaded, and table errors.

                 FullLoadProgressPercent -> (integer)
                     The percent complete for the full load migration task.

                 ElapsedTimeMillis -> (long)
                     The elapsed time of the task, in milliseconds.

                 TablesLoaded -> (integer)
                     The number of tables loaded for this task.

                 TablesLoading -> (integer)

                 TablesErrored -> (integer)
                     The number of errors that have occurred during this task.

                 FreshStartDate -> (timestamp)
                     The date the replication task was started either  with  a
                     fresh start or a target reload.

                 StartDate -> (timestamp)
                     The  date  the replication task was started either with a
                     fresh start  or  a  resume.  For  more  information,  see
                     StartReplicationTaskType .

                 StopDate -> (timestamp)
                     The date the replication task was stopped.

                 FullLoadStartDate -> (timestamp)
                     The date the replication task full load was started.

                 FullLoadFinishDate -> (timestamp)
                     The date the replication task full load was completed.

              TaskData -> (string)
                 Supplemental  information  that  the task requires to migrate
                 the data for certain source and target  endpoints.  For  more
                 information,  see  Specifying Supplemental Data for Task Set-
                 tings in the Database Migration Service User Guide.

              TargetReplicationInstanceArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the replication instance to  which  this  task  is
                 moved  in  response  to  running  the  `  MoveReplicationTask
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_MoveReplicationTask.html`__
                 operation.  Otherwise, this response parameter isn't a member
                 of the ReplicationTask object.
