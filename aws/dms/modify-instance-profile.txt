OPTIONS
       --instance-profile-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the instance profile. Identifiers must begin  with
          a  letter  and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens.
          They can't end with a hyphen, or contain two consecutive hyphens.

       --availability-zone (string)
          The Availability Zone where the instance profile runs.

       --kms-key-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key that is  used  to  en-
          crypt the connection parameters for the instance profile.

          If  you  don't specify a value for the KmsKeyArn parameter, then DMS
          uses your default encryption key.

          KMS creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web  Services
          account.  Your  Amazon  Web Services account has a different default
          encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          Specifies the accessibility options  for  the  instance  profile.  A
          value  of  true  represents an instance profile with a public IP ad-
          dress. A value of false represents an instance profile with  a  pri-
          vate IP address. The default value is true .

       --network-type (string)
          Specifies the network type for the instance profile. A value of IPV4
          represents an instance profile with IPv4 network type and only  sup-
          ports  IPv4  addressing. A value of IPV6 represents an instance pro-
          file with IPv6 network type and only  supports  IPv6  addressing.  A
          value  of DUAL represents an instance profile with dual network type
          that supports IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.

       --instance-profile-name (string)
          A user-friendly name for the instance profile.

       --description (string)
          A user-friendly description for the instance profile.

       --subnet-group-identifier (string)
          A subnet group to associate with the instance profile.

       --vpc-security-groups (list)
          Specifies the VPC security groups to be used with the instance  pro-
          file.  The  VPC security group must work with the VPC containing the
          instance profile.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       InstanceProfile -> (structure)
          The instance profile that was modified.

          InstanceProfileArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) string that uniquely identifies
              the instance profile.

          AvailabilityZone -> (string)
              The Availability Zone where the instance profile runs.

          KmsKeyArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key that  is  used  to
              encrypt the connection parameters for the instance profile.

              If  you  don't specify a value for the KmsKeyArn parameter, then
              DMS uses your default encryption key.

              KMS creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices  account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different
              default encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

          PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
              Specifies the accessibility options for the instance profile.  A
              value  of  true  represents an instance profile with a public IP
              address. A value of false represents an instance profile with  a
              private IP address. The default value is true .

          NetworkType -> (string)
              Specifies  the network type for the instance profile. A value of
              IPV4 represents an instance profile with IPv4 network  type  and
              only supports IPv4 addressing. A value of IPV6 represents an in-
              stance profile with IPv6 network type and only supports IPv6 ad-
              dressing.  A  value  of DUAL represents an instance profile with
              dual network type that supports IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.

          InstanceProfileName -> (string)
              The user-friendly name for the instance profile.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the instance profile. Descriptions can have  up
              to  31 characters. A description can contain only ASCII letters,
              digits, and hyphens ('-'). Also, it can't end with a  hyphen  or
              contain  two consecutive hyphens, and can only begin with a let-
              ter.

          InstanceProfileCreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The time the instance profile was created.

          SubnetGroupIdentifier -> (string)
