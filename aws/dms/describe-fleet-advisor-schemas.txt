SYNOPSIS
            describe-fleet-advisor-schemas
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-records <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          If you specify any of the following filters, the output includes in-
          formation for only those schemas that meet the filter criteria:

          o complexity  The schema's complexity, for example Simple .

          o database-id  The ID of the schema's database.

          o database-ip-address  The IP address of the schema's database.

          o database-name  The name of the schema's database.

          o database-engine  The name of the schema database's engine.

          o original-schema-name   The  name  of  the schema's database's main
            schema.

          o schema-id  The ID of the schema, for example 15 .

          o schema-name  The name of the schema.

          o server-ip-address  The IP address of the schema database's server.

          An    example    is:     describe-fleet-advisor-schemas     --filter
          Name="schema-id",Values="50"

          (structure)
              Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is
              used to limit the number and type of DMS objects  that  are  re-
              turned  for  a  particular  Describe* call or similar operation.
              Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API opera-
              tions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the filter as specified for a Describe* or simi-
                 lar operation.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter value, which can specify one or more  values  used
                 to narrow the returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-records (integer)
          Sets the maximum number of records returned in the response.

       --next-token (string)
          If  NextToken is returned by a previous response, there are more re-
          sults available. The value of NextToken is a unique pagination token
          for  each  page. Make the call again using the returned token to re-
          trieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
