DESCRIBE-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTIONS()                  DESCRIBE-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTIONS()



NAME
       describe-event-subscriptions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all the event subscriptions for a customer account. The descrip-
       tion of a subscription includes SubscriptionName , SNSTopicARN  ,  Cus-
       tomerID , SourceType , SourceID , CreationTime , and Status .

       If you specify SubscriptionName , this action lists the description for
       that subscription.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-event-subscriptions is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: EventSubscriptionsList

SYNOPSIS
            describe-event-subscriptions
          [--subscription-name <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The name of the DMS event subscription to be described.

       --filters (list)
          Filters applied to event subscriptions.

          Valid filter names: event-subscription-arn | event-subscription-id

          (structure)
              Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is
              used to limit the number and type of DMS objects  that  are  re-
              turned  for  a  particular  Describe* call or similar operation.
              Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API opera-
              tions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the filter as specified for a Describe* or simi-
                 lar operation.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter value, which can specify one or more  values  used
                 to narrow the returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              ateEventSubscription operation.

              CustomerAwsId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Web Services customer account associated with the
                 DMS event notification subscription.
