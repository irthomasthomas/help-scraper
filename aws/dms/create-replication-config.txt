OPTIONS
       --replication-config-identifier (string)
          A unique identifier that you want to use to create a ReplicationCon-
          figArn that is returned as part of the output from this action.  You
          can  then  pass this output ReplicationConfigArn as the value of the
          ReplicationConfigArn option for other actions to identify  both  DMS
          Serverless replications and replication configurations that you want
          those actions to operate on. For some actions, you can also use  ei-
          ther this unique identifier or a corresponding ARN in action filters
          to identify the specific replication and  replication  configuration
          to operate on.

       --source-endpoint-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the source endpoint for this DMS
          Serverless replication configuration.

       --target-endpoint-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target endpoint for  this  DMS
          serverless replication configuration.

       --compute-config (structure)
          Configuration parameters for provisioning an DMS Serverless replica-
          tion.

          AvailabilityZone -> (string)
              The Availability Zone where the DMS Serverless replication using
              this configuration will run. The default value is a random, sys-
              tem-chosen Availability Zone in the configuration's  Amazon  Web
              Services  Region,  for example, "us-west-2" . You can't set this
              parameter if the MultiAZ parameter is set to true .

          DnsNameServers -> (string)
              A list of custom DNS name servers supported for the DMS  Server-
              less  replication to access your source or target database. This
              list overrides the default name servers  supported  by  the  DMS
              Serverless  replication.  You can specify a comma-separated list
              of internet addresses for up to four DNS name servers. For exam-
              ple: "1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2,3.3.3.3,4.4.4.4"

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              An  Key  Management Service (KMS) key Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
              that is used to encrypt the data during DMS Serverless  replica-
              tion.

              If  you  don't  specify  a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, DMS
              uses your default encryption key.

              KMS creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices  account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different
              default encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

          MaxCapacityUnits -> (integer)
              Specifies the maximum value of the DMS capacity units (DCUs) for
              which  a  given DMS Serverless replication can be provisioned. A
              single DCU is 2GB of RAM, with 1 DCU as the  minimum  value  al-
              lowed. The list of valid DCU values includes 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,
              64, 128, 192, 256, and 384. So, the maximum value that  you  can
              specify  for DMS Serverless is 384. The MaxCapacityUnits parame-
              ter is the only DCU parameter you are required to specify.

          MinCapacityUnits -> (integer)
              Specifies the minimum value of the DMS capacity units (DCUs) for
              which  a  given DMS Serverless replication can be provisioned. A
              single DCU is 2GB of RAM, with 1 DCU as the  minimum  value  al-
              lowed. The list of valid DCU values includes 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,
              64, 128, 192, 256, and 384. So, the minimum DCU value  that  you
              can specify for DMS Serverless is 1. You don't have to specify a
              value for the MinCapacityUnits parameter. If you don't set  this
              value, DMS scans the current activity of available source tables
              to identify an optimum setting for this parameter. If  there  is
              no  current  source  activity  or DMS can't otherwise identify a
              more appropriate value, it sets this parameter  to  the  minimum
              DCU value allowed, 1.

          MultiAZ -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  the DMS Serverless replication is a Multi-AZ
              deployment. You can't set the AvailabilityZone parameter if  the
              MultiAZ parameter is set to true .

          PreferredMaintenanceWindow -> (string)
              The  weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur
              for the DMS Serverless  replication,  in  Universal  Coordinated
              Time (UTC). The format is ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi .

              The  default  is  a  30-minute window selected at random from an
              8-hour block of time per Amazon Web Services Region. This  main-
              tenance  occurs  on  a  random day of the week. Valid values for
              days of the week include Mon , Tue , Wed , Thu , Fri , Sat , and
              Sun .

              Constraints include a minimum 30-minute window.

          ReplicationSubnetGroupId -> (string)
              Specifies  a  subnet  group identifier to associate with the DMS
              Serverless replication.

          VpcSecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              Specifies the virtual private cloud (VPC) security group to  use
              with the DMS Serverless replication. The VPC security group must
              work with the VPC containing the replication.

          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       ReplicationConfig -> (structure)
          Configuration  parameters  returned from the DMS Serverless replica-
          tion after it is created.

          ReplicationConfigIdentifier -> (string)
              The identifier for the  ReplicationConfig  associated  with  the
              replication.

          ReplicationConfigArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of this DMS Serverless replica-
              tion configuration.

          SourceEndpointArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source endpoint  for  this
              DMS serverless replication configuration.

          TargetEndpointArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the target endpoint for this
              DMS serverless replication configuration.

          ReplicationType -> (string)
              The type of the replication.

          ComputeConfig -> (structure)
              Configuration parameters  for  provisioning  an  DMS  serverless
              replication.

              AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                 The  Availability  Zone  where the DMS Serverless replication
                 using this configuration will run. The  default  value  is  a
                 random,  system-chosen  Availability  Zone  in the configura-
                 tion's Amazon Web Services Region, for example, "us-west-2" .
                 You  can't set this parameter if the MultiAZ parameter is set
                 to true .

              DnsNameServers -> (string)
                 A list of custom DNS  name  servers  supported  for  the  DMS
                 Serverless  replication to access your source or target data-
                 base. This list overrides the default name servers  supported
                 by   the  DMS  Serverless  replication.  You  can  specify  a
                 comma-separated list of internet addresses for up to four DNS
                 name servers. For example: "1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2,3.3.3.3,4.4.4.4"

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 An  Key  Management  Service  (KMS)  key Amazon Resource Name
                 (ARN) that is used to encrypt the data during DMS  Serverless
                 replication.

                 If  you don't specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, DMS
                 uses your default encryption key.

                 KMS creates the default encryption key for  your  Amazon  Web
                 Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a dif-
                 ferent default encryption key for each  Amazon  Web  Services
                 Region.

              MaxCapacityUnits -> (integer)
                 Specifies  the maximum value of the DMS capacity units (DCUs)
                 for which a given DMS Serverless replication  can  be  provi-
                 sioned. A single DCU is 2GB of RAM, with 1 DCU as the minimum
                 value allowed. The list of valid DCU values includes 1, 2, 4,
                 8,  16, 32, 64, 128, 192, 256, and 384. So, the maximum value
                 that you can specify for DMS Serverless is 384. The MaxCapac-
                 ityUnits parameter is the only DCU parameter you are required
                 to specify.

              MinCapacityUnits -> (integer)
                 Specifies the minimum value of the DMS capacity units  (DCUs)
                 for  which  a  given DMS Serverless replication can be provi-
                 sioned. A single DCU is 2GB of RAM, with 1 DCU as the minimum
                 value allowed. The list of valid DCU values includes 1, 2, 4,
                 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 192, 256, and 384. So,  the  minimum  DCU
                 value that you can specify for DMS Serverless is 1. You don't
                 have to specify a value for the  MinCapacityUnits  parameter.
                 If  you  don't set this value, DMS scans the current activity
                 of available source tables to identify an optimum setting for
                 this parameter. If there is no current source activity or DMS
                 can't otherwise identify a more appropriate  value,  it  sets
                 this parameter to the minimum DCU value allowed, 1.

              MultiAZ -> (boolean)
                 Specifies   whether  the  DMS  Serverless  replication  is  a
                 Multi-AZ deployment. You can't set the  AvailabilityZone  pa-
                 rameter if the MultiAZ parameter is set to true .

              PreferredMaintenanceWindow -> (string)
                 The weekly time range during which system maintenance can oc-
                 cur for the DMS Serverless replication, in Universal  Coordi-
                 nated Time (UTC). The format is ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi .

                 The  default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an
                 8-hour block of time per Amazon  Web  Services  Region.  This
                 maintenance  occurs on a random day of the week. Valid values
                 for days of the week include Mon , Tue , Wed , Thu  ,  Fri  ,
                 Sat , and Sun .

                 Constraints include a minimum 30-minute window.

              ReplicationSubnetGroupId -> (string)
                 Specifies a subnet group identifier to associate with the DMS
                 Serverless replication.
