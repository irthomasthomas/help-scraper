OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Filters applied to the instance profiles described in  the  form  of
          key-value pairs.

          (structure)
              Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is
              used to limit the number and type of DMS objects  that  are  re-
              turned  for  a  particular  Describe* call or similar operation.
              Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API opera-
              tions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the filter as specified for a Describe* or simi-
                 lar operation.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter value, which can specify one or more  values  used
                 to narrow the returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-records (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of records to include in the response. If more
          records exist than the specified MaxRecords value,  DMS  includes  a
          pagination  token  in  the response so that you can retrieve the re-
          maining results.

       --marker (string)
          Specifies the unique pagination token that makes it possible to dis-
          play  the  next page of results. If this parameter is specified, the
          response includes only records beyond the marker, up  to  the  value
          specified by MaxRecords .

          If Marker is returned by a previous response, there are more results
          available. The value of Marker is a unique pagination token for each
          page.  To  retrieve the next page, make the call again using the re-
          turned token and keeping all other arguments unchanged.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          Specifies the unique pagination token that makes it possible to dis-
          play  the  next page of results. If this parameter is specified, the
          response includes only records beyond the marker, up  to  the  value
          specified by MaxRecords .

          If Marker is returned by a previous response, there are more results
          available. The value of Marker is a unique pagination token for each
          page.  To  retrieve the next page, make the call again using the re-
          turned token and keeping all other arguments unchanged.

       InstanceProfiles -> (list)
          A description of instance profiles.

          (structure)
              Provides information that defines an instance profile.

              InstanceProfileArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) string that  uniquely  identi-
                 fies the instance profile.

              AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                 The Availability Zone where the instance profile runs.

              KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key that is used to
                 encrypt the connection parameters for the instance profile.

                 If you don't specify a value  for  the  KmsKeyArn  parameter,
                 then DMS uses your default encryption key.

                 KMS  creates  the  default encryption key for your Amazon Web
                 Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a dif-
                 ferent  default  encryption  key for each Amazon Web Services
                 Region.

              PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
                 Specifies the accessibility options for the instance profile.
                 A  value of true represents an instance profile with a public
                 IP address. A value of false represents an  instance  profile
                 with a private IP address. The default value is true .

              NetworkType -> (string)
                 Specifies  the network type for the instance profile. A value
                 of IPV4 represents an instance profile with IPv4 network type
                 and only supports IPv4 addressing. A value of IPV6 represents
                 an instance profile with IPv6 network type and only  supports
                 IPv6  addressing. A value of DUAL represents an instance pro-
                 file with dual network type that supports IPv4 and  IPv6  ad-
                 dressing.

              InstanceProfileName -> (string)
                 The user-friendly name for the instance profile.

              Description -> (string)
                 A  description of the instance profile. Descriptions can have
                 up to 31 characters. A description  can  contain  only  ASCII
                 letters, digits, and hyphens ('-'). Also, it can't end with a
                 hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens, and can only begin
                 with a letter.

              InstanceProfileCreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the instance profile was created.

              SubnetGroupIdentifier -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of  the subnet group that is associated with
                 the instance profile.

              VpcSecurityGroups -> (list)
                 The VPC security groups that are used with the instance  pro-
                 file.  The VPC security group must work with the VPC contain-
                 ing the instance profile.

                 (string)
