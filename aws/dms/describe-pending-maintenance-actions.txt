OPTIONS
       --replication-instance-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication instance.

       --filters (list)
          (structure)
              Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is
              used to limit the number and type of DMS objects  that  are  re-
              turned  for  a  particular  Describe* call or similar operation.
              Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API opera-
              tions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the filter as specified for a Describe* or simi-
                 lar operation.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter value, which can specify one or more  values  used
                 to narrow the returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --marker (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       --max-records (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of records to include in the response. If more
          records exist than the specified MaxRecords value, a pagination  to-
          ken  called a marker is included in the response so that the remain-
          ing results can be retrieved.

          Default: 100

          Constraints: Minimum 20, maximum 100.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       PendingMaintenanceActions -> (list)
          The pending maintenance action.

          (structure)
              Identifies an DMS resource and any pending actions for it.

              ResourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the DMS resource that the
                 pending maintenance action applies to. For information  about
                 creating  an  ARN,  see  Constructing an Amazon Resource Name
                 (ARN) for DMS in the DMS documentation.

              PendingMaintenanceActionDetails -> (list)
                 Detailed information about the pending maintenance action.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a maintenance action pending  for  an  DMS  re-
                     source,  including  when and how it will be applied. This
                     data type is a response element to  the  DescribePending-
                     MaintenanceActions operation.

                     Action -> (string)
                        The  type of pending maintenance action that is avail-
                        able for the resource.

                     AutoAppliedAfterDate -> (timestamp)
                        The date of the maintenance window when the action  is
                        to  be  applied.  The maintenance action is applied to
                        the resource during its first maintenance window after
                        this date. If this date is specified, any next-mainte-
                        nance opt-in requests are ignored.

                     ForcedApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                        The date when the maintenance action will be automati-
                        cally  applied.  The  maintenance action is applied to
                        the resource on this date regardless  of  the  mainte-
                        nance  window for the resource. If this date is speci-
                        fied, any immediate opt-in requests are ignored.

                     OptInStatus -> (string)
                        The type of opt-in request that has been received  for
                        the resource.

                     CurrentApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                        The effective date when the pending maintenance action
                        will be applied to the resource. This date takes  into
                        account  opt-in  requests received from the ApplyPend-
                        ingMaintenanceAction API operation, and also  the  Au-
                        toAppliedAfterDate  and ForcedApplyDate parameter val-
                        ues. This value is blank if an opt-in request has  not
                        been  received  and nothing has been specified for Au-
                        toAppliedAfterDate or ForcedApplyDate .

                     Description -> (string)
                        A description providing more detail about the  mainte-
                        nance action.

       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .
