NAME
       start-replication-task-assessment-run -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts a new premigration assessment run for one or more individual as-
       sessments of a migration task.

       The assessments that you can specify depend on the  source  and  target
       database  engine  and the migration type defined for the given task. To
       run this operation, your migration task must already be created.  After
       you  run  this  operation, you can review the status of each individual
       assessment. You can also run the migration task manually after the  as-
       sessment run and its individual assessments complete.

OPTIONS
       --replication-task-arn (string)
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the migration task associated with the
          premigration assessment run that you want to start.

       --service-access-role-arn (string)
          ARN of the service role needed to start the assessment run. The role
          must allow the iam:PassRole action.

       --result-location-bucket (string)
          Amazon S3 bucket where you want DMS to store the results of this as-
          sessment run.

       --result-location-folder (string)
          Folder within an Amazon S3 bucket where you want DMS  to  store  the
          results of this assessment run.

       --result-encryption-mode (string)
          Encryption  mode that you can specify to encrypt the results of this
          assessment run. If you don't specify  this  request  parameter,  DMS
          stores  the assessment run results without encryption. You can spec-
          ify one of the options following:

          o "SSE_S3"  The server-side encryption provided as a default by Ama-
            zon S3.

          o "SSE_KMS"   Key  Management Service (KMS) encryption. This encryp-
            tion can use either a custom KMS encryption key that  you  specify
            or the default KMS encryption key that DMS provides.

       --result-kms-key-arn (string)
          ARN of a custom KMS encryption key that you specify when you set Re-
          sultEncryptionMode to "SSE_KMS ".

       --assessment-run-name (string)
          Unique name to identify the assessment run.

       --include-only (list)
          Space-separated list of names for  specific  individual  assessments
          that  you want to include. These names come from the default list of
          individual assessments that DMS supports for the  associated  migra-
          tion task. This task is specified by ReplicationTaskArn .

          NOTE:
              You  can't  set  a value for IncludeOnly if you also set a value
              for Exclude in the API operation.

              To identify the names of the default individual assessments that
              DMS  supports  for  the  associated  migration task, run the De-
              scribeApplicableIndividualAssessments operation  using  its  own
              ReplicationTaskArn request parameter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --exclude (list)
          Space-separated  list  of  names for specific individual assessments
          that you want to exclude. These names come from the default list  of
          individual  assessments  that DMS supports for the associated migra-
          tion task. This task is specified by ReplicationTaskArn .

          NOTE:
              You can't set a value for Exclude if you also set  a  value  for
              IncludeOnly in the API operation.

              To identify the names of the default individual assessments that
              DMS supports for the associated  migration  task,  run  the  De-
              scribeApplicableIndividualAssessments  operation  using  its own
              ReplicationTaskArn request parameter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
