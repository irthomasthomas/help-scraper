OPTIONS
       --instance-profile-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the instance profile to delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       InstanceProfile -> (structure)
          The instance profile that was deleted.

          InstanceProfileArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) string that  uniquely  identifies
              the instance profile.

          AvailabilityZone -> (string)
              The Availability Zone where the instance profile runs.

          KmsKeyArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the KMS key that is used to
              encrypt the connection parameters for the instance profile.

              If you don't specify a value for the KmsKeyArn  parameter,  then
              DMS uses your default encryption key.

              KMS  creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web Ser-
              vices account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a  different
              default encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

          PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
              Specifies  the accessibility options for the instance profile. A
              value of true represents an instance profile with  a  public  IP
              address.  A value of false represents an instance profile with a
              private IP address. The default value is true .

          NetworkType -> (string)
              Specifies the network type for the instance profile. A value  of
              IPV4  represents  an instance profile with IPv4 network type and
              only supports IPv4 addressing. A value of IPV6 represents an in-
              stance profile with IPv6 network type and only supports IPv6 ad-
              dressing. A value of DUAL represents an  instance  profile  with
              dual network type that supports IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.

          InstanceProfileName -> (string)
              The user-friendly name for the instance profile.

          Description -> (string)
              A  description of the instance profile. Descriptions can have up
              to 31 characters. A description can contain only ASCII  letters,
              digits,  and  hyphens ('-'). Also, it can't end with a hyphen or
              contain two consecutive hyphens, and can only begin with a  let-
              ter.

          InstanceProfileCreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The time the instance profile was created.

          SubnetGroupIdentifier -> (string)
              The  identifier  of the subnet group that is associated with the
              instance profile.

          VpcSecurityGroups -> (list)
              The VPC security groups that are used with the instance profile.
              The VPC security group must work with the VPC containing the in-
