OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Filters  applied  to  the  limitations  described  in  the  form  of
          key-value pairs.

          (structure)
              Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is
              used to limit the number and type of DMS objects  that  are  re-
              turned  for  a  particular  Describe* call or similar operation.
              Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API opera-
              tions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the filter as specified for a Describe* or simi-
                 lar operation.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter value, which can specify one or more  values  used
                 to narrow the returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-records (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of records to include in the response. If more
          records exist than the specified MaxRecords value, Fleet Advisor in-
          cludes  a  pagination token in the response so that you can retrieve
          the remaining results.

       --next-token (string)
          Specifies the unique pagination token that makes it possible to dis-
          play  the  next page of results. If this parameter is specified, the
          response includes only records beyond the marker, up  to  the  value
          specified by MaxRecords .

          If  NextToken is returned by a previous response, there are more re-
          sults available. The value of NextToken is a unique pagination token
          for  each  page. Make the call again using the returned token to re-
          trieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The unique pagination token returned for you to pass to a subsequent
          request. Fleet Advisor returns this token when the number of records
          in the response is greater than the MaxRecords  value.  To  retrieve
          the  next  page,  make  the  call again using the returned token and
          keeping all other arguments unchanged.

       Limitations -> (list)
          The list of limitations for recommendations  of  target  Amazon  Web
          Services engines.

          (structure)
              Provides  information about the limitations of target Amazon Web
              Services engines.

              Your source database might include features that the target Ama-
              zon  Web  Services  engine  doesn't support. Fleet Advisor lists
              these features as limitations. You should consider these limita-
              tions  during database migration. For each limitation, Fleet Ad-
              visor recommends an action that you can take to address or avoid
              this limitation.

              DatabaseId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the source database.

              EngineName -> (string)
                 The  name  of the target engine that Fleet Advisor should use
                 in the target engine  recommendation.  Valid  values  include
                 "rds-aurora-mysql"  , "rds-aurora-postgresql" , "rds-mysql" ,
                 "rds-oracle" , "rds-sql-server" , and "rds-postgresql" .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the limitation.  Describes  unsupported  database
                 features, migration action items, and other limitations.

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the limitation. Provides additional informa-
                 tion about the limitation, and includes  recommended  actions
                 that you can take to address or avoid this limitation.

              Impact -> (string)
                 The  impact  of the limitation. You can use this parameter to
                 prioritize limitations that you want to address. Valid values
                 include "Blocker" , "High" , "Medium" , and "Low" .

              Type -> (string)
                 The  type of the limitation, such as action required, upgrade
                 required, and limited feature.
