SYNOPSIS
            describe-fleet-advisor-schema-object-summary
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-records <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          If you specify any of the following filters, the output includes in-
          formation  for only those schema objects that meet the filter crite-
          ria:

          o schema-id     The    ID    of    the    schema,    for     example
            d4610ac5-e323-4ad9-bc50-eaf7249dfe9d .

          Example:    describe-fleet-advisor-schema-object-summary    --filter
          Name="schema-id",Values="50"

          (structure)
              Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is
              used  to  limit  the number and type of DMS objects that are re-
              turned for a particular Describe*  call  or  similar  operation.
              Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API opera-
              tions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter as specified for a Describe* or  simi-
                 lar operation.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  value, which can specify one or more values used
                 to narrow the returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-records (integer)
          Sets the maximum number of records returned in the response.

       --next-token (string)
          If NextToken is returned by a previous response, there are more  re-
          sults available. The value of NextToken is a unique pagination token
          for each page. Make the call again using the returned token  to  re-
          trieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FleetAdvisorSchemaObjects -> (list)
          A collection of FleetAdvisorSchemaObjectResponse objects.

          (structure)
              Describes a schema object in a Fleet  Advisor  collector  inven-

              SchemaId -> (string)
                 The ID of a schema object in a Fleet Advisor collector inven-

              ObjectType -> (string)
                 The type of the schema object, as reported  by  the  database

              NumberOfObjects -> (long)
                 The  number  of objects in a schema object in a Fleet Advisor
                 collector inventory.

              CodeLineCount -> (long)
                 The number of lines of code in a schema object in a Fleet Ad-
                 visor collector inventory.

              CodeSize -> (long)
                 The  size level of the code in a schema object in a Fleet Ad-
                 visor collector inventory.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If NextToken is returned, there  are  more  results  available.  The
          value  of NextToken is a unique pagination token for each page. Make
          the call again using the returned token to retrieve the  next  page.
          Keep all other arguments unchanged.
