BATCH-START-RECOMMENDATIONS()                    BATCH-START-RECOMMENDATIONS()



NAME
       batch-start-recommendations -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  the  analysis  of up to 20 source databases to recommend target
       engines  for  each  source  database.  This  is  a  batch  version   of
       StartRecommendations .

       The result of analysis of each source database is reported individually
       in the response. Because the batch request can result in a  combination
       of  successful and unsuccessful actions, you should check for batch er-
       rors even when the call returns an HTTP status code of 200 .

OPTIONS
       --data (list)
          Provides information about source databases to analyze.  After  this
          analysis,  Fleet  Advisor  recommends target engines for each source
          database.

          (structure)
              Provides information about the source database  to  analyze  and
              provide  target  recommendations  according to the specified re-
              quirements.

              DatabaseId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the source database.

              Settings -> (structure)
                 The required target engine settings.

                 InstanceSizingType -> (string)
                     The size of your target instance.  Fleet  Advisor  calcu-
                     lates this value based on your data collection type, such
                     as total capacity and resource utilization. Valid  values
                     include "total-capacity" and "utilization" .

                 WorkloadType -> (string)
                     The deployment option for your target engine. For produc-
                     tion databases, Fleet Advisor  chooses  Multi-AZ  deploy-
                     ment.  For  development  or test databases, Fleet Advisor
                     chooses Single-AZ deployment. Valid values  include  "de-
                     velopment" and "production" .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DatabaseId=string,Settings={InstanceSizingType=string,WorkloadType=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "DatabaseId": "string",
              "Settings": {
                "InstanceSizingType": "string",
                "WorkloadType": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ErrorEntries -> (list)
          A  list  with  error details about the analysis of each source data-
          base.

          (structure)
              Provides information about the errors that occurred  during  the
              analysis of the source database.

              DatabaseId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the source database.
