NAME
       describe-extension-pack-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a paginated list of extension pack associations for the speci-
       fied migration project. An extension pack is an add-on module that emu-
       lates  functions  present  in  a source database that are required when
       converting objects to the target database.

OPTIONS
       --migration-project-identifier (string)
          The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the migration project.

       --filters (list)
          Filters applied to the extension pack associations described in  the
          form of key-value pairs.

          (structure)
              Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is
              used to limit the number and type of DMS objects  that  are  re-
              turned  for  a  particular  Describe* call or similar operation.
              Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API opera-
              tions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the filter as specified for a Describe* or simi-
                 lar operation.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter value, which can specify one or more  values  used
                 to narrow the returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --marker (string)
          Specifies the unique pagination token that makes it possible to dis-
          play the next page of results. If this parameter is  specified,  the
          response  includes  only  records beyond the marker, up to the value
          specified by MaxRecords .

          If Marker is returned by a previous response, there are more results
          available. The value of Marker is a unique pagination token for each
          page. To retrieve the next page, make the call again using  the  re-
          turned token and keeping all other arguments unchanged.

       --max-records (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of records to include in the response. If more
          records exist than the specified MaxRecords value,  DMS  includes  a
          pagination  token  in  the response so that you can retrieve the re-
          maining results.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          Specifies the unique pagination token that makes it possible to dis-
          play  the  next page of results. If this parameter is specified, the
          response includes only records beyond the marker, up  to  the  value
          specified by MaxRecords .

          If Marker is returned by a previous response, there are more results
          available. The value of Marker is a unique pagination token for each
          page.  To  retrieve the next page, make the call again using the re-
          turned token and keeping all other arguments unchanged.

       Requests -> (list)
          A paginated list of extension pack associations  for  the  specified
          migration project.

              RequestIdentifier -> (string)

              MigrationProjectArn -> (string)

                     ing top level keys can be set: defaultErrorDetails.
