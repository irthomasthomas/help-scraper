OPTIONS
       --entries (list)
          The list of events to write to the event bus.

          (structure)
              The details about an event generated by an SaaS partner.

              Time -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time of the event.

              Source -> (string)
                 The event source that is generating the entry.

              Resources -> (list)
                 Amazon Web Services resources, identified by Amazon  Resource
                 Name  (ARN),  which the event primarily concerns. Any number,
                 including zero, may be present.

                 (string)

              DetailType -> (string)
                 A free-form string used to decide what fields  to  expect  in
                 the event detail.

              Detail -> (string)
                 A  valid  JSON  string. There is no other schema imposed. The
                 JSON string may contain fields and nested subobjects.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Time=timestamp,Source=string,Resources=string,string,DetailType=string,Detail=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Time": timestamp,
              "Source": "string",
              "Resources": ["string", ...],
              "DetailType": "string",
              "Detail": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Entries -> (list)
