CREATE-ENDPOINT()                                            CREATE-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       create-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a global endpoint. Global endpoints improve your application's
       availability by making it regional-fault tolerant. To do this, you  de-
       fine  a  primary  and secondary Region with event buses in each Region.
       You also create a Amazon Route 53 health check that  will  tell  Event-
       Bridge  to  route  events  to  the secondary Region when an "unhealthy"
       state is encountered and events will be routed back to the primary  Re-
       gion when the health check reports a "healthy" state.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)

       --routing-config (structure)
          Configure the routing policy, including the health  check  and  sec-
          ondary Region..

          FailoverConfig -> (structure)
              The  failover  configuration for an endpoint. This includes what
              triggers failover and what happens when it's triggered.

              Primary -> (structure)
                 The main Region of the endpoint.

                 HealthCheck -> (string)
                     The ARN of the health check used by the endpoint  to  de-
                     termine whether failover is triggered.

              Secondary -> (structure)
                 The  Region  that events are routed to when failover is trig-
                 gered or event replication is enabled.

                 Route -> (string)
                     Defines the secondary Region.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FailoverConfig={Primary={HealthCheck=string},Secondary={Route=string}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FailoverConfig": {
              "Primary": {
                "HealthCheck": "string"
              },
              "Secondary": {
                "Route": "string"
              }
            }
          }

       --replication-config (structure)
          Enable or disable event replication. The default  state  is  ENABLED
          which  means you must supply a RoleArn . If you don't have a RoleArn
          or you don't want event replication enabled, set the state  to  DIS-
          ABLED .

          State -> (string)
              The state of event replication.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          State=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "State": "ENABLED"|"DISABLED"
          }

       --event-buses (list)
          Define the event buses used.

          WARNING:
              The names of the event buses must be identical in each Region.

          (structure)
              The event buses the endpoint is associated with.

              EventBusArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the event bus the endpoint is associated with.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EventBusArn=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "EventBusArn": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --role-arn (string)
          The ARN of the role used for replication.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
