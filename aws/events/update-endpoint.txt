          ondary Region.

          FailoverConfig -> (structure)
              The failover configuration for an endpoint. This  includes  what

              Primary -> (structure)
                 The main Region of the endpoint.

                 HealthCheck -> (string)
                     The  ARN  of the health check used by the endpoint to de-
                     termine whether failover is triggered.

              Secondary -> (structure)
                 The Region that events are routed to when failover  is  trig-
                 gered or event replication is enabled.

                 Route -> (string)
                     Defines the secondary Region.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FailoverConfig={Primary={HealthCheck=string},Secondary={Route=string}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FailoverConfig": {
              "Primary": {
                "HealthCheck": "string"
              },
              "Secondary": {
                "Route": "string"
              }
            }

          Whether event replication was enabled or disabled by this request.

          State -> (string)
              The state of event replication.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          State=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "State": "ENABLED"|"DISABLED"
          }

       --event-buses (list)
          Define event buses used for replication.

          (structure)
              The event buses the endpoint is associated with.

              EventBusArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the event bus the endpoint is associated with.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EventBusArn=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "EventBusArn": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --role-arn (string)
          The ARN of the role used by event replication for this request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)
