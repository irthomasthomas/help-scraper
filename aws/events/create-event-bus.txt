CREATE-EVENT-BUS()                                          CREATE-EVENT-BUS()



NAME
       create-event-bus -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new event bus within your account. This can be a custom event
       bus which you can use to receive events from your  custom  applications
       and  services, or it can be a partner event bus which can be matched to
       a partner event source.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the new event bus.

          Custom event bus names can't contain the / character,  but  you  can
          use  the  /  character  in partner event bus names. In addition, for
          partner event buses, the name must exactly match  the  name  of  the
          partner event source that this event bus is matched to.

          You  can't use the name default for a custom event bus, as this name
          is already used for your account's default event bus.

       --event-source-name (string)
          If you are creating a partner event bus, this specifies the  partner
          event source that the new event bus will be matched with.

       --description (string)
          The event bus description.

       --kms-key-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  of  the KMS customer managed key for EventBridge to
          use, if you choose to use a customer managed key to  encrypt  events
          on  this  event  bus.  The identifier can be the key Amazon Resource
          Name (ARN), KeyId, key alias, or key alias ARN.

          If you do not specify a customer managed key identifier, EventBridge
          uses an Amazon Web Services owned key to encrypt events on the event
          bus.

          For more information, see Managing keys in the Key  Management  Ser-
          vice Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              Archives  and schema discovery are not supported for event buses
              encrypted using a customer managed key. EventBridge  returns  an
              error if:

              o You call `` CreateArchive `` on an event bus set to use a cus-
                tomer managed key for encryption.

              o You call `` CreateDiscoverer `` on an event bus set to  use  a
                customer managed key for encryption.

              o You  call  `` UpdatedEventBus `` to set a customer managed key
                on an event bus with an archives or schema discovery enabled.

              To enable archives or schema discovery on an event  bus,  choose
              to  use  an Amazon Web Services owned key. For more information,
              see Data encryption in EventBridge  in  the  Amazon  EventBridge
              User Guide .

       --dead-letter-config (structure)
          Configuration details of the Amazon SQS queue for EventBridge to use
          as a dead-letter queue (DLQ).

          For more information, see Event retry policy and  using  dead-letter
          queues in the EventBridge User Guide .

          Arn -> (string)
              The  ARN  of  the  SQS  queue  specified  as  the target for the
              dead-letter queue.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Arn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Arn": "string"
          }

       --tags (list)
          Tags to associate with the event bus.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair associated with  an  Amazon  Web  Services  re-
              source. In EventBridge, rules and event buses support tagging.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  string  you  can use to assign a value. The combination of
                 tag keys and values can help you organize and categorize your
                 resources.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the specified tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
