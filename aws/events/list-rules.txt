LIST-RULES()                                                      LIST-RULES()



NAME
       list-rules -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  your Amazon EventBridge rules. You can either list all the rules
       or you can provide a prefix to match to the rule names.

       ListRules does not list the targets of a rule. To see the targets asso-
       ciated with a rule, use ListTargetsByRule .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-rules  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Rules

OPTIONS
       --name-prefix (string)
          The prefix matching the rule name.

       --event-bus-name (string)
          The name or ARN of the event bus to list the rules for. If you  omit
          this, the default event bus is used.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To display a list of all CloudWatch Events rules

       This example displays all CloudWatch Events rules in the region:

          aws events list-rules

       To display a list of CloudWatch Events rules beginning with  a  certain
       string.

       This  example  displays  all CloudWatch Events rules in the region that
       have a name starting with "Daily":

          aws events list-rules --name-prefix "Daily"

OUTPUT
       Rules -> (list)
          The rules that match the specified criteria.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a rule in Amazon EventBridge.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the rule.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule.

              EventPattern -> (string)
                 The event pattern of the  rule.  For  more  information,  see
                 Events  and  Event  Patterns  in  the Amazon EventBridge User
                 Guide .

              State -> (string)
                 The state of the rule.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the rule.

              ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                 The scheduling expression. For example, "cron(0 20 * * ?
                 *
                 )", "rate(5 minutes)". For more information, see Creating  an
                 Amazon EventBridge rule that runs on a schedule .

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 307)
                        Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the role that is used for
                 target invocation.

                 If you're setting an event bus in another account as the tar-
                 get  and  that  account  granted  permission  to your account
                 through an organization instead of directly  by  the  account
                 ID, you must specify a RoleArn with proper permissions in the
                 Target structure, instead of here in this parameter.

              ManagedBy -> (string)
                 If the rule was created on behalf of your account by an  Ama-
                 zon  Web  Services service, this field displays the principal
                 name of the service that created the rule.

              EventBusName -> (string)
                 The name or ARN of the event bus associated with the rule. If
                 you omit this, the default event bus is used.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Indicates whether there are additional results to retrieve. If there
          are no more results, the value is null.
