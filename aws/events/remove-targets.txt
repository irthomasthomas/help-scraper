REMOVE-TARGETS()                                              REMOVE-TARGETS()



NAME
       remove-targets -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes the specified targets from the specified rule. When the rule is
       triggered, those targets are no longer be invoked.

       NOTE:
          A successful execution of RemoveTargets doesn't guarantee  all  tar-
          gets  are  removed from the rule, it means that the target(s) listed
          in the request are removed.

       When you remove a target, when the associated  rule  triggers,  removed
       targets  might continue to be invoked. Allow a short period of time for
       changes to take effect.

       This action can partially fail if too many requests  are  made  at  the
       same  time.  If  that  happens, FailedEntryCount is non-zero in the re-
       sponse and each entry in FailedEntries provides the ID  of  the  failed
       target and the error code.

OPTIONS
       --rule (string)
          The name of the rule.

       --event-bus-name (string)
          The  name  or  ARN of the event bus associated with the rule. If you
          omit this, the default event bus is used.

       --ids (list)
          The IDs of the targets to remove from the rule.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          If this is a managed rule, created by an Amazon Web Services service
          on  your  behalf,  you must specify Force as True to remove targets.
          This parameter is ignored for rules that are not managed rules.  You
          can  check whether a rule is a managed rule by using DescribeRule or
          ListRules and checking the ManagedBy field of the response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To remove a target for an event

       This example removes the Amazon Kinesis stream named MyStream1 from be-
       ing  a target of the rule DailyLambdaFunction. When DailyLambdaFunction
       was created, this stream was set as a target with an ID of Target1:

          aws events remove-targets --rule "DailyLambdaFunction" --ids "Target1"

OUTPUT
       FailedEntryCount -> (integer)
          The number of failed entries.

       FailedEntries -> (list)
          The failed target entries.

          (structure)
              Represents a target that failed to be removed from a rule.

              TargetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the target.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The error code that indicates why the target removal  failed.
                 If  the  value  is ConcurrentModificationException , too many
                 requests were made at the same time.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The error  message  that  explains  why  the  target  removal
                 failed.
