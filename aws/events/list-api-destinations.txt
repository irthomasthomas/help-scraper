OPTIONS
       --name-prefix (string)
          A name prefix to filter results returned. Only API destinations with
          a name that starts with the prefix are returned.

       --connection-arn (string)
          The ARN of the connection specified for the API destination.

       --next-token (string)
          The token returned by a previous call, which you can use to retrieve
          the next set of results.

          The value of nextToken is a unique pagination token for  each  page.
          To  retrieve the next page of results, make the call again using the
          returned token. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

          Using an expired pagination token results in an HTTP 400  InvalidTo-
          ken error.

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of API destinations to include in the response.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ApiDestinations -> (list)
          An array that includes information about each API destination.

          (structure)
              Contains details about an API destination.

              ApiDestinationArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the API destination.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the API destination.

              ApiDestinationState -> (string)
                 The state of the API destination.

              ConnectionArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the connection specified for the API destination.

              InvocationEndpoint -> (string)
                 The URL to the endpoint for the API destination.

              HttpMethod -> (string)
                 The method to use to connect to the HTTP endpoint.

              InvocationRateLimitPerSecond -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  number of invocations per second to send to the
                 HTTP endpoint.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp for the time that the API destination  was  cre-
                 ated.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  time  stamp for the time that the API destination was last
                 modified.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token indicating there are more results available. If there are no
          more results, no token is included in the response.

          The  value  of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page.
          To retrieve the next page of results, make the call again using  the
          returned token. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

          Using  an expired pagination token results in an HTTP 400 InvalidTo-
          ken error.
