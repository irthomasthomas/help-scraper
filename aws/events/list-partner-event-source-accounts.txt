OPTIONS
       --event-source-name (string)
          The  name of the partner event source to display account information
          about.

       --next-token (string)
          The token returned by a previous call to this operation.  Specifying
          this retrieves the next set of results.

       --limit (integer)
          Specifying this limits the number of results returned by this opera-
          tion. The operation also returns a NextToken which you can use in  a
          subsequent operation to retrieve the next set of results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       PartnerEventSourceAccounts -> (list)
          The list of partner event sources returned by the operation.

          (structure)
              The  Amazon Web Services account that a partner event source has
              been offered to.

              Account -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID  that  the  partner  event
                 source was offered to.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the event source was created.

              ExpirationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and time that the event source will expire, if the
                 Amazon Web Services account doesn't create a  matching  event
                 bus for it.

              State -> (string)
                 The  state of the event source. If it is ACTIVE, you have al-
                 ready created a matching event bus for this event source, and
                 that  event  bus  is  active.  If  it  is PENDING, either you
                 haven't yet created a matching event bus, or that  event  bus
                 is deactivated. If it is DELETED, you have created a matching
                 event bus, but the event source has since been deleted.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token you can use in a subsequent operation to retrieve  the  next
          set of results.
