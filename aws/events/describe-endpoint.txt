NAME
       describe-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Get  the information about an existing global endpoint. For more infor-
       mation about global endpoints, see Making  applications  Regional-fault
       tolerant  with  global  endpoints  and  event replication in the Amazon
       EventBridge User Guide..

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-endpoint
          --name <value>
          [--home-region <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the endpoint you want to get information about. For  ex-
          ample, "Name":"us-east-2-custom_bus_A-endpoint" .

       --home-region (string)
          The  primary  Region  of  the  endpoint  you want to get information
          about. For example "HomeRegion": "us-east-1" .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     termine whether failover is triggered.

              Secondary -> (structure)
                 The Region that events are routed to when failover  is  trig-
                 gered or event replication is enabled.

                 Route -> (string)
                     Defines the secondary Region.
