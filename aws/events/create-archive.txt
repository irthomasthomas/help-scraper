CREATE-ARCHIVE()                                              CREATE-ARCHIVE()



NAME
       create-archive -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an archive of events with the specified settings. When you cre-
       ate an archive, incoming events might not immediately start being  sent
       to  the  archive.  Allow a short period of time for changes to take ef-
       fect. If you do not specify a pattern to filter events sent to the  ar-
       chive,  all  events are sent to the archive except replayed events. Re-
       played events are not sent to an archive.

OPTIONS
       --archive-name (string)
          The name for the archive to create.

       --event-source-arn (string)
          The ARN of the event bus that sends events to the archive.

       --description (string)
          A description for the archive.

       --event-pattern (string)
          An event pattern to use to filter events sent to the archive.

       --retention-days (integer)
          The number of days to retain events for. Default value is 0. If  set
          to 0, events are retained indefinitely

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
