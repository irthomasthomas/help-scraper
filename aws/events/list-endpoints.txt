OPTIONS
       --name-prefix (string)
          A value that will return a subset of the endpoints  associated  with
          this  account. For example, "NamePrefix": "ABC" will return all end-
          points with "ABC" in the name.

       --home-region (string)
          The primary Region of the endpoints associated  with  this  account.
          For example "HomeRegion": "us-east-1" .

       --next-token (string)
          The token returned by a previous call, which you can use to retrieve
          the next set of results.

          The value of nextToken is a unique pagination token for  each  page.
          To  retrieve the next page of results, make the call again using the
          returned token. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

          Using an expired pagination token results in an HTTP 400  InvalidTo-
          ken error.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results returned by the call.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Endpoints -> (list)
          The endpoints returned by the call.

          (structure)
              A  global endpoint used to improve your application's availabil-
              ity by making it regional-fault tolerant. For  more  information
              about  global  endpoints, see Making applications Regional-fault
              tolerant with global endpoints and event replication  in  the  *
              Amazon EventBridge User Guide * .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the endpoint.

              Description -> (string)
                 A description for the endpoint.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the endpoint.

              RoutingConfig -> (structure)
                 The routing configuration of the endpoint.

                 FailoverConfig -> (structure)
                     The failover configuration for an endpoint. This includes
                     what triggers failover and what happens when  it's  trig-
                     gered.

                     Primary -> (structure)
                        The main Region of the endpoint.

                        HealthCheck -> (string)
                            The  ARN  of the health check used by the endpoint
                            to determine whether failover is triggered.

                     Secondary -> (structure)
                        The Region that events are routed to when failover  is
                        triggered or event replication is enabled.

                        Route -> (string)
                            Defines the secondary Region.

              ReplicationConfig -> (structure)
                 Whether  event  replication  was enabled or disabled for this
                 endpoint. The default state is ENABLED which means  you  must
                 supply  a  RoleArn . If you don't have a RoleArn or you don't
                 want event replication enabled, set the state to DISABLED .

                 State -> (string)
                     The state of event replication.

              EventBuses -> (list)

                     EventBusArn -> (string)
                        The ARN of the event bus the  endpoint  is  associated
                        with.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  the role used by event replication for the end-
                 point.

              EndpointId -> (string)
                 The URL subdomain of the endpoint. For example,  if  the  URL
                 for                        Endpoint                        is
                 https://abcde.veo.endpoints.event.amazonaws.com,   then   the
                 EndpointId is abcde.veo .

              EndpointUrl -> (string)
                 The URL of the endpoint.

              State -> (string)
                 The current state of the endpoint.

              StateReason -> (string)
                 The reason the endpoint is in its current state.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the endpoint was created.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last time the endpoint was modified.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token indicating there are more results available. If there are no
          more results, no token is included in the response.

          The value of nextToken is a unique pagination token for  each  page.
          To  retrieve the next page of results, make the call again using the
          returned token. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

          Using an expired pagination token results in an HTTP 400  InvalidTo-
          ken error.
