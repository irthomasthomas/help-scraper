DESCRIPTION
       List the global endpoints associated with this account. For more infor-
       mation about global endpoints, see Making  applications  Regional-fault
       tolerant  with  global  endpoints  and  event replication in the Amazon
       EventBridge User Guide..

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-endpoints
          [--name-prefix <value>]
          [--home-region <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name-prefix (string)
          A value that will return a subset of the endpoints  associated  with
          this  account. For example, "NamePrefix": "ABC" will return all end-
          points with "ABC" in the name.

       --home-region (string)
          The primary Region of the endpoints associated  with  this  account.
          For example "HomeRegion": "us-east-1" .

       --next-token (string)
          If  nextToken  is  returned,  there  are more results available. The
          value of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page.  Make
          the  call  again using the returned token to retrieve the next page.
          Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each  pagination  token  expires
          after  24  hours.  Using  an expired pagination token will return an
          HTTP 400 InvalidToken error.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results returned by the call.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Endpoints -> (list)
          The endpoints returned by the call.

          (structure)
              An global endpoint used to improve your application's availabil-
              ity by making it regional-fault tolerant. For  more  information
              about  global  endpoints, see Making applications Regional-fault
              tolerant with global endpoints and event replication in the Ama-
              zon EventBridge User Guide..

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the endpoint.

              Description -> (string)
                 A description for the endpoint.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the endpoint.

              RoutingConfig -> (structure)
                 The routing configuration of the endpoint.

                 FailoverConfig -> (structure)
                     The failover configuration for an endpoint. This includes
                     what triggers failover and what happens when  it's  trig-
                     gered.

                     Primary -> (structure)
                        The main Region of the endpoint.

                        HealthCheck -> (string)
                            The  ARN  of the health check used by the endpoint
                            to determine whether failover is triggered.

                     Secondary -> (structure)
                        The Region that events are routed to when failover  is
                        triggered or event replication is enabled.

                        Route -> (string)
                            Defines the secondary Region.

              ReplicationConfig -> (structure)
                 Whether  event  replication  was enabled or disabled for this
                 endpoint.

                 State -> (string)
                     The state of event replication.

              EventBuses -> (list)
                 The event buses being used by the endpoint.

                 (structure)
                     The event buses the endpoint is associated with.

                     EventBusArn -> (string)
                        The ARN of the event bus the  endpoint  is  associated
                        with.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  the role used by event replication for the end-
                 point.

              EndpointId -> (string)
                 The URL subdomain of the endpoint. For example,  if  the  URL
                 for Endpoint is abcde.veo.endpoints.event.amazonaws.com, then
                 the EndpointId is abcde.veo .

              EndpointUrl -> (string)
                 The URL of the endpoint.

              State -> (string)
                 The current state of the endpoint.

              StateReason -> (string)
                 The reason the endpoint is in its current state.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the endpoint was created.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last time the endpoint was modified.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If nextToken is returned, there  are  more  results  available.  The
          value  of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page. Make
          the call again using the returned token to retrieve the  next  page.
          Keep  all  other  arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires
          after 24 hours. Using an expired pagination  token  will  return  an
          HTTP 400 InvalidToken error.
