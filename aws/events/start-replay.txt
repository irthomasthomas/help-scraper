START-REPLAY()                                                  START-REPLAY()



NAME
       start-replay -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts the specified replay. Events are not necessarily replayed in the
       exact same order that they were added to the  archive.  A  replay  pro-
       cesses  events  to  replay  based on the time in the event, and replays
       them using 1 minute intervals. If you specify an EventStartTime and  an
       EventEndTime  that  covers  a  20 minute time range, the events are re-
       played from the first minute of that 20 minute range  first.  Then  the
       events  from the second minute are replayed. You can use DescribeReplay
       to determine the progress of a replay. The value returned for EventLas-
       tReplayedTime  indicates the time within the specified time range asso-
       ciated with the last event replayed.

OPTIONS
       --replay-name (string)
          The name of the replay to start.

       --description (string)
          A description for the replay to start.

       --event-source-arn (string)
          The ARN of the archive to replay events from.

       --event-start-time (timestamp)
          A time stamp for the time to start  replaying  events.  Only  events
          that  occurred  between  the EventStartTime and EventEndTime are re-
          played.

       --event-end-time (timestamp)
          A time stamp for the time to stop replaying events. Only events that
          occurred between the EventStartTime and EventEndTime are replayed.

       --destination (structure)
          A  ReplayDestination object that includes details about the destina-
          tion for the replay.

          Arn -> (string)
              The ARN of the event bus to replay  event  to.  You  can  replay
              events only to the event bus specified to create the archive.

          FilterArns -> (list)
              A list of ARNs for rules to replay events to.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Arn=string,FilterArns=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Arn": "string",
            "FilterArns": ["string", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ReplayArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the replay.

       State -> (string)
          The state of the replay.

       StateReason -> (string)
          The reason that the replay is in the state.

       ReplayStartTime -> (timestamp)
          The time at which the replay started.
