OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the event bus.

       --kms-key-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  of  the KMS customer managed key for EventBridge to
          use, if you choose to use a customer managed key to  encrypt  events
          on  this  event  bus.  The identifier can be the key Amazon Resource
          Name (ARN), KeyId, key alias, or key alias ARN.

          If you do not specify a customer managed key identifier, EventBridge
          uses an Amazon Web Services owned key to encrypt events on the event
          bus.

          For more information, see Managing keys in the Key  Management  Ser-
          vice Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              Archives  and schema discovery are not supported for event buses
              encrypted using a customer managed key. EventBridge  returns  an
              error if:

              o You call `` CreateArchive `` on an event bus set to use a cus-
                tomer managed key for encryption.

              o You call `` CreateDiscoverer `` on an event bus set to  use  a
                customer managed key for encryption.

              o You  call  `` UpdatedEventBus `` to set a customer managed key
                on an event bus with an archives or schema discovery enabled.

              To enable archives or schema discovery on an event  bus,  choose
              to  use  an Amazon Web Services owned key. For more information,
              see Data encryption in EventBridge  in  the  Amazon  EventBridge
              User Guide .

       --description (string)
          The event bus description.

       --dead-letter-config (structure)
          Configuration details of the Amazon SQS queue for EventBridge to use
          as a dead-letter queue (DLQ).

          For more information, see Using dead-letter queues to process  unde-
          livered events in the EventBridge User Guide .

          Arn -> (string)
              The  ARN  of  the  SQS  queue  specified  as  the target for the
              dead-letter queue.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Arn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Arn": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The event bus Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       Name -> (string)
          The event bus name.

       KmsKeyIdentifier -> (string)
          The identifier of the KMS customer managed key  for  EventBridge  to
          use to encrypt events on this event bus, if one has been specified.
