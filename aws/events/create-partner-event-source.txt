CREATE-PARTNER-EVENT-SOURCE()                    CREATE-PARTNER-EVENT-SOURCE()



NAME
       create-partner-event-source -

DESCRIPTION
       Called by an SaaS partner to create a partner event source. This opera-
       tion is not used by Amazon Web Services customers.

       Each partner event source can be used by one Amazon  Web  Services  ac-
       count  to  create  a matching partner event bus in that Amazon Web Ser-
       vices account. A SaaS partner must create one partner event source  for
       each  Amazon  Web  Services  account  that wants to receive those event
       types.

       A partner event source creates events based  on  resources  within  the
       SaaS partner's service or application.

       An  Amazon  Web  Services account that creates a partner event bus that
       matches the partner event source can use  that  event  bus  to  receive
       events  from  the  partner, and then process them using Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Events rules and targets.

       Partner event source names follow this format:
          `` partner_name /event_namespace /event_name ``

       o partner_name is determined during partner registration,  and  identi-
         fies the partner to Amazon Web Services customers.

       o event_namespace  is  determined  by the partner, and is a way for the
         partner to categorize their events.

       o event_name is determined by the partner, and should uniquely identify
         an   event-generating   resource  within  the  partner  system.   The
         event_name must be unique across all Amazon Web  Services  customers.
         This  is  because  the  event source is a shared resource between the
         partner and customer accounts, and each partner event  source  unique
         in the partner account.

       The  combination  of  event_namespace and event_name should help Amazon
       Web Services customers decide whether to create an event bus to receive
       these events.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The  name  of the partner event source. This name must be unique and
          must be in the format `` partner_name  /event_namespace  /event_name
          ``  . The Amazon Web Services account that wants to use this partner
          event source must create a  partner  event  bus  with  a  name  that
          matches the name of the partner event source.

       --account (string)
          The  Amazon  Web  Services  account ID that is permitted to create a
          matching partner event bus for this partner event source.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       EventSourceArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the partner event source.
