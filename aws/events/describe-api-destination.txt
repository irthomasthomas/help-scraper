OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the API destination to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ApiDestinationArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the API destination retrieved.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the API destination retrieved.

       Description -> (string)
          The description for the API destination retrieved.

       ApiDestinationState -> (string)
          The state of the API destination retrieved.

       ConnectionArn -> (string)
          The  ARN  of  the  connection  specified for the API destination re-
          trieved.

       InvocationEndpoint -> (string)
          The URL to use to connect to the HTTP endpoint.

       HttpMethod -> (string)
          The method to use to connect to the HTTP endpoint.

       InvocationRateLimitPerSecond -> (integer)
          The maximum number of invocations per second to  specified  for  the
          API destination. Note that if you set the invocation rate maximum to
          a value lower the rate necessary to send all events received  on  to
          the  destination  HTTP  endpoint,  some  events may not be delivered
          within the 24-hour retry window. If you plan to set the  rate  lower
          than  the  rate  necessary  to  deliver all events, consider using a
          dead-letter queue to catch events that are not delivered  within  24
          hours.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          A time stamp for the time that the API destination was created.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          A  time  stamp  for the time that the API destination was last modi-
          fied.
