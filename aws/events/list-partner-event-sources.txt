OPTIONS
       --name-prefix (string)
          If  you  specify this, the results are limited to only those partner
          event sources that start with the string you specify.

       --next-token (string)
          The token returned by a previous call, which you can use to retrieve
          the next set of results.

          The  value  of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page.
          To retrieve the next page of results, make the call again using  the
          returned token. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

          Using  an expired pagination token results in an HTTP 400 InvalidTo-
          ken error.

       --limit (integer)
          pecifying this limits the number of results returned by this  opera-
          tion.  The operation also returns a NextToken which you can use in a
          subsequent operation to retrieve the next set of results.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       PartnerEventSources -> (list)
          The list of partner event sources returned by the operation.

          (structure)
              A partner event source is created by an SaaS partner. If a  cus-
              tomer  creates  a  partner  event  bus  that  matches this event
              source, that Amazon Web Services account can receive events from
              the partner's applications or services.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the partner event source.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the partner event source.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token indicating there are more results available. If there are no
          more results, no token is included in the response.

          The value of nextToken is a unique pagination token for  each  page.
          To  retrieve the next page of results, make the call again using the
          returned token. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

          Using an expired pagination token results in an HTTP 400  InvalidTo-
          ken error.
