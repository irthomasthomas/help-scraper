DELETE-RULE()                                                    DELETE-RULE()



NAME
       delete-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified rule.

       Before  you  can  delete  the  rule, you must remove all targets, using
       RemoveTargets .

       When you delete a rule, incoming events might continue to match to  the
       deleted rule. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.

       If  you  call  delete  rule multiple times for the same rule, all calls
       will succeed. When you call  delete  rule  for  a  non-existent  custom
       eventbus, ResourceNotFoundException is returned.

       Managed  rules are rules created and managed by another Amazon Web Ser-
       vices service on your behalf. These rules are created  by  those  other
       Amazon  Web  Services  services  to support functionality in those ser-
       vices. You can delete these rules  using  the  Force  option,  but  you
       should  do so only if you are sure the other service is not still using
       that rule.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the rule.

       --event-bus-name (string)
          The name or ARN of the event bus associated with the  rule.  If  you
          omit this, the default event bus is used.

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          If this is a managed rule, created by an Amazon Web Services service
          on your behalf, you must specify Force as True to delete  the  rule.
          This  parameter is ignored for rules that are not managed rules. You
          can check whether a rule is a managed rule by using DescribeRule  or
          ListRules and checking the ManagedBy field of the response.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
