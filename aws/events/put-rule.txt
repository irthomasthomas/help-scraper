PUT-RULE()                                                          PUT-RULE()



NAME
       put-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates or updates the specified rule. Rules are enabled by default, or
       based on value of the state. You can disable a rule using DisableRule .

       A single rule watches for events from a single event bus. Events gener-
       ated by Amazon Web Services services go to your account's default event
       bus. Events generated by SaaS partner services or  applications  go  to
       the matching partner event bus. If you have custom applications or ser-
       vices, you can specify whether their events go to  your  default  event
       bus  or a custom event bus that you have created. For more information,
       see CreateEventBus .

       If you are updating an existing rule, the rule is  replaced  with  what
       you specify in this PutRule command. If you omit arguments in PutRule ,
       the old values for those arguments are not kept. Instead, they are  re-
       placed with null values.

       When you create or update a rule, incoming events might not immediately
       start matching to new or updated rules. Allow a short  period  of  time
       for changes to take effect.

       A  rule  must  contain  at least an EventPattern or ScheduleExpression.
       Rules with EventPatterns are triggered when a  matching  event  is  ob-
       served.  Rules with ScheduleExpressions self-trigger based on the given
       schedule. A rule can have both an EventPattern  and  a  ScheduleExpres-
       sion,  in which case the rule triggers on matching events as well as on
       a schedule.

       When you initially create a rule, you can optionally assign one or more
       tags  to  the  rule. Tags can help you organize and categorize your re-
       sources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a
       user permission to access or change only rules with certain tag values.
       To use the PutRule operation and assign tags, you must  have  both  the
       events:PutRule and events:TagResource permissions.

       If  you  are updating an existing rule, any tags you specify in the Pu-
       tRule operation are ignored. To update the tags of  an  existing  rule,
       use TagResource and UntagResource .

       Most services in Amazon Web Services treat : or / as the same character
       in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). However,  EventBridge  uses  an  exact
       match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN char-
       acters when creating event patterns so that they match the  ARN  syntax
       in the event you want to match.

       In  EventBridge,  it  is possible to create rules that lead to infinite
       loops, where a rule is fired repeatedly. For example, a rule might  de-
       tect  that  ACLs  have changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to
       change them to the desired state. If the rule is not written carefully,
       the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again, creating an in-
       finite loop.

       To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions  do  not
       re-fire  the  same rule. For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs
       are found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change.

       An infinite loop can quickly cause higher  than  expected  charges.  We
       recommend  that you use budgeting, which alerts you when charges exceed
       your specified limit. For more information,  see  Managing  Your  Costs
       with Budgets .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the rule that you are creating or updating.

       --schedule-expression (string)
          The scheduling expression. For example, "cron(0 20 * * ?
          *
          )" or "rate(5 minutes)".

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 114)
                 Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

       --event-pattern (string)
          The  event  pattern.  For  more  information, see Amazon EventBridge
          event patterns in the * Amazon EventBridge User Guide * .

       --state (string)
          The state of the rule.

          Valid values include:

          o DISABLED : The rule is disabled. EventBridge does  not  match  any
            events against the rule.

          o ENABLED  : The rule is enabled. EventBridge matches events against
            the rule, except for Amazon Web Services management events  deliv-
            ered through CloudTrail.

          o ENABLED_WITH_ALL_CLOUDTRAIL_MANAGEMENT_EVENTS  :  The  rule is en-
            abled for all events, including  Amazon  Web  Services  management
            events  delivered  through  CloudTrail.  Management events provide
            visibility into management operations that are  performed  on  re-
            sources  in your Amazon Web Services account. These are also known
            as control plane operations. For  more  information,  see  Logging
            management  events  in  the  CloudTrail User Guide , and Filtering
            management events from Amazon Web Services services in the *  Ama-
            zon  EventBridge User Guide * . This value is only valid for rules
            on the default event bus or custom event buses . It does not apply
            to partner event buses .

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DISABLED

          o ENABLED_WITH_ALL_CLOUDTRAIL_MANAGEMENT_EVENTS

       --description (string)
          A description of the rule.

       --role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role associated with the
          rule.

          If you're setting an event bus in another account as the target  and
          that account granted permission to your account through an organiza-
          tion instead of directly by the  account  ID,  you  must  specify  a
          RoleArn  with proper permissions in the Target structure, instead of
          here in this parameter.

       --tags (list)
          The list of key-value pairs to associate with the rule.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair associated with  an  Amazon  Web  Services  re-
              source. In EventBridge, rules and event buses support tagging.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  string  you  can use to assign a value. The combination of
                 tag keys and values can help you organize and categorize your
                 resources.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the specified tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --event-bus-name (string)
          The name or ARN of the event bus to associate with this rule. If you
          omit this, the default event bus is used.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create CloudWatch Events rules

       This example creates a rule that triggers every day  at  9:00am  (UTC).
       If  you  use  put-targets  to add a Lambda function as a target of this
       rule, you could run the Lambda function  every  day  at  the  specified
       time:

          aws events put-rule --name "DailyLambdaFunction" --schedule-expression "cron(0 9 * * ? *)"

       This  example creates a rule that triggers when any EC2 instance in the
       region changes state:

          aws events put-rule --name "EC2InstanceStateChanges" --event-pattern "{\"source\":[\"aws.ec2\"],\"detail-type\":[\"EC2 Instance State-change Notification\"]}"  --role-arn "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyRoleForThisRule"

       This example creates a rule that triggers when any EC2 instance in  the
       region is stopped or terminated:

          aws events put-rule --name "EC2InstanceStateChangeStopOrTerminate" --event-pattern "{\"source\":[\"aws.ec2\"],\"detail-type\":[\"EC2 Instance State-change Notification\"],\"detail\":{\"state\":[\"stopped\",\"terminated\"]}}" --role-arn "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyRoleForThisRule"

OUTPUT
       RuleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule.
