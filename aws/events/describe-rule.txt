OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the rule.

       --event-bus-name (string)
          The name or ARN of the event bus associated with the  rule.  If  you
          omit this, the default event bus is used.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To display information about a CloudWatch Events rule

       This example displays information about the rule named DailyLambdaFunc-
       tion:

          aws events describe-rule --name "DailyLambdaFunction"

OUTPUT
       Name -> (string)
          The name of the rule.

       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule.

       EventPattern -> (string)
          The  event  pattern. For more information, see Events and Event Pat-
          terns in the * Amazon EventBridge User Guide * .

       ScheduleExpression -> (string)
          The scheduling expression. For example, "cron(0 20 * * ?
          *
          )", "rate(5 minutes)".

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 225)
                 Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

       State -> (string)
          Specifies whether the rule is enabled or disabled.

       Description -> (string)
          The description of the rule.

       RoleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role associated  with  the
          rule.

       ManagedBy -> (string)
          If this is a managed rule, created by an Amazon Web Services service
          on your behalf, this field displays the principal name of the Amazon
          Web Services service that created the rule.

       EventBusName -> (string)
          The name of the event bus associated with the rule.

       CreatedBy -> (string)
          The account ID of the user that created the rule. If you use PutRule
          to put a rule on an event bus in another account, the other  account
          is  the  owner of the rule, and the rule ARN includes the account ID
          for that account. However, the value for CreatedBy is the account ID
          as the account that created the rule in the other account.
