OPTIONS
       --name-prefix (string)
          Specifying this limits the results to only those  event  buses  with
          names that start with the specified prefix.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  returned  by a previous call to retrieve the next set of
          results.

       --limit (integer)
          Specifying this limits the number of results returned by this opera-
          tion.  The operation also returns a NextToken which you can use in a
          subsequent operation to retrieve the next set of results.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       EventBuses -> (list)
          This list of event buses.

          (structure)
              An  event  bus  receives events from a source and routes them to
              rules associated with that event  bus.  Your  account's  default
              event  bus  receives events from Amazon Web Services services. A
              custom event bus can receive events from  your  custom  applica-
              tions  and services. A partner event bus receives events from an
              event source created by an SaaS partner. These events come  from
              the partners services or applications.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the event bus.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the event bus.

              Policy -> (string)
                 The  permissions  policy  of  the event bus, describing which
                 other Amazon Web Services accounts can write events  to  this
                 event bus.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  you can use in a subsequent operation to retrieve the next
          set of results.
