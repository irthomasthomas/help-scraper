OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          The  token  that is needed to support idempotency. Idempotency isn't

          The billing group name. The names must be unique.

       --account-grouping (structure)
          The set of accounts that will be under the billing group. The set of
          accounts resemble the linked accounts in a consolidated family.

          LinkedAccountIds -> (list)
              The account IDs that make up the billing group. Account IDs must
              be a part of the consolidated billing family, and not associated
              with another billing group.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          LinkedAccountIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "LinkedAccountIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --computation-preference (structure)
          The preferences and settings that will be used to compute the Amazon
          Web Services charges for a billing group.

          PricingPlanArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the pricing plan used to  com-
              pute the Amazon Web Services charges for a billing group.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PricingPlanArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "PricingPlanArn": "string"
          }

       --primary-account-id (string)
          The account ID that serves as the main account in a billing group.

       --description (string)
          The billing group description.

       --tags (map)
          A  map  that contains tag keys and tag values that are attached to a
          billing group. This feature isn't available during the beta.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the created billing group.
