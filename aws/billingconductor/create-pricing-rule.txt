          pricing rule.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

            ...}

       --billing-entity (string)
          The seller of services provided by Amazon Web Services, their affil-
          iates, or third-party providers selling services via Amazon Web Ser-
          vices Marketplace.

          The set of tiering configurations for the pricing rule.

          FreeTier -> (structure)
              The possible Amazon Web Services Free Tier configurations.

       --usage-type (string)
          Usage  type  is the unit that each service uses to measure the usage
          of a specific type of resource.

          If the Scope attribute is set to  SKU  ,  this  attribute  indicates
          which   usage  type  the  PricingRule  is  modifying.  For  example,
          USW2-BoxUsage:m2.2xlarge describes an``M2 High Memory  Double  Extra

          If the Scope attribute is set to  SKU  ,  this  attribute  indicates
          which  operation  the PricingRule is modifying. For example, a value
          of RunInstances:0202 indicates the operation of  running  an  Amazon
          EC2 instance.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
