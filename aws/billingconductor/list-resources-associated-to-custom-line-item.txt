LIST-RESOURCES-ASSOCIATED-TO-CULIST-RESOURCES-ASSOCIATED-TO-CUSTOM-LINE-ITEM()



NAME
       list-resources-associated-to-custom-line-item -

DESCRIPTION
       List the resources associated to a custom line item.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-resources-associated-to-custom-line-item is a paginated operation.
       Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire  data
       set  of results. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-pagi-
       nate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on  a
       paginated response, the --query argument must extract data from the re-
       sults of the following query expressions: AssociatedResources

SYNOPSIS
            list-resources-associated-to-custom-line-item
          [--billing-period <value>]
          --arn <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --billing-period (string)
          The billing period for  which  the  resource  associations  will  be
          listed.

       --arn (string)
          The  ARN of the custom line item for which the resource associations
          will be listed.

       --filters (structure)
          (Optional) A ListResourcesAssociatedToCustomLineItemFilter that  can
          specify the types of resources that should be retrieved.

          Relationship -> (string)
              The  type  of  relationship between the custom line item and the
              associated resource.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Relationship=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Relationship": "PARENT"|"CHILD"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The custom line item ARN for which  the  resource  associations  are
          listed.

       AssociatedResources -> (list)
          A list of ListResourcesAssociatedToCustomLineItemResponseElement for
          each resource association retrieved.

          (structure)
              A representation of a resource association  for  a  custom  line
              item.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the associated resource.

              Relationship -> (string)
                 The type of relationship between the custom line item and the
                 associated resource.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token to be used in subsequent requests  to  retrieve
          additional results.
