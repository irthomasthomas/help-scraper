SYNOPSIS
            batch-associate-resources-to-custom-line-item
          --target-arn <value>
          --resource-arns <value>
          [--billing-period-range <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --target-arn (string)
          A percentage custom line item ARN to associate the resources to.

       --resource-arns (list)
          A list containing the ARNs of the resources to be associated.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --billing-period-range (structure)
          The  billing period range in which the custom line item request will
          be applied.

          InclusiveStartBillingPeriod -> (string)
              The inclusive start billing period that defines a billing period
              range where a custom line is applied.

          ExclusiveEndBillingPeriod -> (string)
              The  inclusive  end billing period that defines a billing period
              range where a custom line is applied.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InclusiveStartBillingPeriod=string,ExclusiveEndBillingPeriod=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "InclusiveStartBillingPeriod": "string",
            "ExclusiveEndBillingPeriod": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SuccessfullyAssociatedResources -> (list)
          A  list of AssociateResourceResponseElement for each resource that's
          been associated to a percentage custom line item successfully.

          (structure)
              A resource association result for a percentage custom line item.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The resource ARN that was associated to the custom line item.

              Error -> (structure)
                 An AssociateResourceError that will populate if the  resource
                 association fails.

                 Message -> (string)
                     The reason the resource association failed.

                     failure.

       FailedAssociatedResources -> (list)
          A list of AssociateResourceResponseElement for  each  resource  that
          failed association to a percentage custom line item.

          (structure)
              A resource association result for a percentage custom line item.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The resource ARN that was associated to the custom line item.

              Error -> (structure)
                 An  AssociateResourceError that will populate if the resource
                 association fails.

                 Message -> (string)
                     The reason the resource association failed.
