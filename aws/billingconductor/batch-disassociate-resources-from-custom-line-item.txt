SYNOPSIS
            batch-disassociate-resources-from-custom-line-item
          --target-arn <value>
          --resource-arns <value>
          [--billing-period-range <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --target-arn (string)
          A  percentage  custom  line  item  ARN to disassociate the resources
          from.

       --resource-arns (list)
          A list containing the ARNs of resources to be disassociated.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --billing-period-range (structure)
          The billing period range in which the custom line item request  will
          be applied.

          InclusiveStartBillingPeriod -> (string)
              The inclusive start billing period that defines a billing period
              range where a custom line is applied.

          ExclusiveEndBillingPeriod -> (string)
              The inclusive end billing period that defines a  billing  period
              range where a custom line is applied.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InclusiveStartBillingPeriod=string,ExclusiveEndBillingPeriod=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "InclusiveStartBillingPeriod": "string",
            "ExclusiveEndBillingPeriod": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
