SYNOPSIS
            update-pricing-rule
          --arn <value>
          [--name <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          [--type <value>]
          [--modifier-percentage <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the pricing rule to update.

       --name (string)
          The  new  name  of the pricing rule. The name must be unique to each
          pricing rule.

       --description (string)
          The new description for the pricing rule.

       --type (string)
          The new pricing rule type.

          Possible values:

          o MARKUP

          o DISCOUNT

       --modifier-percentage (double)
          The new modifier to show pricing plan rates as a percentage.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
