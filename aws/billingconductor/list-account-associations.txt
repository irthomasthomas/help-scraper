DESCRIPTION
          o Amazon  Web  Services  Billing Conductor is in beta release and is
            subject to change. Your use of Amazon Web Services Billing Conduc-
            tor  is  subject  to  the  Beta Service Participation terms of the

            vice-terms/>`__ (Section 1.10). *

       This is a paginated call to list linked accounts that are linked to the
       payer account for the specified time period. If no information is  pro-
       vided, the current billing period is used. The response will optionally
       include the billing group associated with the linked account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-account-associations is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: LinkedAccounts

SYNOPSIS
            list-account-associations
          [--billing-period <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]

OPTIONS
       --billing-period (string)
          The preferred billing period to get account associations.

       --filters (structure)
          The  filter  on  the account ID of the linked account, or any of the
          following:
              MONITORED : linked  accounts  that  are  associated  to  billing
              groups.

              UNMONITORED : linked accounts that are not associated to billing
              groups.

              Billing Group Arn : linked accounts that are associated  to  the
              provided billing group Arn.

          Association -> (string)
              MONITORED  :  linked  accounts  that  are  associated to billing
              groups.

              UNMONITORED : linked accounts that are not associated to billing
              groups.

              Billing  Group  Arn : linked accounts that are associated to the
              provided Billing Group Arn.

          AccountId -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services account ID to filter on.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Association=string,AccountId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Association": "string",
            "AccountId": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LinkedAccounts -> (list)
          The list of linked accounts in the payer account.
