       --status (string)
          The status of the billing group. Only one of the valid values can be
          used.

       --computation-preference (structure)
          The preferences and settings that will be used to compute the Amazon
          Web Services charges for a billing group.

          PricingPlanArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the pricing plan used to  com-
              pute the Amazon Web Services charges for a billing group.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PricingPlanArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "PricingPlanArn": "string"
          }

       --description (string)
          A description of the billing group.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
