LIST-CUSTOM-LINE-ITEMS()                              LIST-CUSTOM-LINE-ITEMS()



NAME
       list-custom-line-items -

DESCRIPTION
       A paginated call to get a list of all custom line items (FFLIs) for the
       given billing period. If you don't provide a billing period,  the  cur-
       rent billing period is used.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-custom-line-items is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: CustomLineItems

SYNOPSIS
            list-custom-line-items
          [--billing-period <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --billing-period (string)
          The preferred billing period to get custom line items (FFLIs).

       --filters (structure)
          A ListCustomLineItemsFilter that  specifies  the  custom  line  item
          names  and/or billing group Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to retrieve
          FFLI information.

          Names -> (list)
              A list of custom line items to retrieve information.

              (string)

          BillingGroups -> (list)
              The billing group Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to  retrieve  in-
              formation.

              (string)

          Arns -> (list)
              A list of custom line item ARNs to retrieve information.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Names=string,string,BillingGroups=string,string,Arns=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Names": ["string", ...],
            "BillingGroups": ["string", ...],
            "Arns": ["string", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
