UPDATE-LINK()                                                    UPDATE-LINK()



NAME
       update-link -

DESCRIPTION
       Use  this  operation  to  change  what  types of data are shared from a
       source account to its linked monitoring account sink. You can't  change
       the sink or change the monitoring account with this operation.

       When you update a link, you can optionally specify filters that specify
       which metric namespaces and which log groups are shared from the source
       account to the monitoring account.

       To update the list of tags associated with the sink, use TagResource .

OPTIONS
       --identifier (string)
          The ARN of the link that you want to update.

       --link-configuration (structure)
          Use  this  structure to filter which metric namespaces and which log
          groups are to be shared from the source account  to  the  monitoring
          account.

          LogGroupConfiguration -> (structure)
              Use  this  structure  to filter which log groups are to send log
              events from the source account to the monitoring account.

              Filter -> (string)
                 Use this field to specify which log groups are to share their
                 log  events  with  the  monitoring account. Use the term Log-
                 GroupName and one or more of the following operands. Use sin-
                 gle  quotation marks (') around log group names. The matching
                 of log group names is case sensitive. Each filter has a limit
                 of  five  conditional  operands. Conditional operands are AND
                 and OR .

                 o = and !=

                 o AND

                 o OR

                 o LIKE and NOT LIKE .  These  can  be  used  only  as  prefix
                   searches.  Include  a  %  at the end of the string that you
                   want to search for and include.

                 o IN and NOT IN , using parentheses ( )

                 Examples:

                 o LogGroupName IN ('This-Log-Group',  'Other-Log-Group')  in-
                   cludes  only  the  log groups with names This-Log-Group and
                   Other-Log-Group .

                 o LogGroupName    NOT    IN    ('Private-Log-Group',    'Pri-
                   vate-Log-Group-2')  includes  all log groups except the log
                   groups with names Private-Log-Group and Private-Log-Group-2
                   .

                 o LogGroupName   LIKE  'aws/lambda/%'  OR  LogGroupName  LIKE
                   'AWSLogs%' includes all log groups  that  have  names  that
                   start with aws/lambda/ or AWSLogs .

                 NOTE:
                     If  you  are  updating  a link that uses filters, you can
                     specify * as the only value for the filter  parameter  to
                     delete the filter and share all log groups with the moni-
                     toring account.

          MetricConfiguration -> (structure)
              Use this structure to filter which metric namespaces are  to  be
              shared from the source account to the monitoring account.

              Filter -> (string)
                 Use this field to specify which metrics are to be shared with
                 the monitoring account. Use the term  Namespace  and  one  or
                 more  of  the  following operands. Use single quotation marks
                 (') around namespace names. The matching of  namespace  names
                 is  case  sensitive.  Each  filter has a limit of five condi-
                 tional operands. Conditional operands are AND and OR .

                 o = and !=

                 o AND

                 o OR

                 o LIKE and NOT LIKE .  These  can  be  used  only  as  prefix
                   searches.  Include  a  %  at the end of the string that you
                   want to search for and include.

                 o IN and NOT IN , using parentheses ( )

                 Examples:

                 o Namespace NOT LIKE 'AWS/%' includes  only  namespaces  that
                   don't start with AWS/ , such as custom namespaces.

                 o Namespace IN ('AWS/EC2', 'AWS/ELB', 'AWS/S3') includes only
                   the metrics in the EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, and  Amazon
                   S3 namespaces.

                 o Namespace  =  'AWS/EC2'  OR  Namespace NOT LIKE 'AWS/%' in-
                   cludes only the EC2 namespace and your custom namespaces.

                 NOTE:
                     If you are updating a link that  uses  filters,  you  can
                     specify  *  as the only value for the filter parameter to
                     delete the filter and share all  metric  namespaces  with
                     the monitoring account.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          LogGroupConfiguration={Filter=string},MetricConfiguration={Filter=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "LogGroupConfiguration": {
              "Filter": "string"
            },
            "MetricConfiguration": {
              "Filter": "string"
            }
          }

       --resource-types (list)
          An  array of strings that define which types of data that the source
          account will send to the monitoring account.

          Your input here replaces the current set  of  data  types  that  are
          shared.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            AWS::CloudWatch::Metric
            AWS::Logs::LogGroup
            AWS::XRay::Trace
            AWS::ApplicationInsights::Application
            AWS::InternetMonitor::Monitor

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
