SYNOPSIS
            get-link
          --identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]

          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identifier (string)
          The ARN of the link to retrieve information for.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The ARN of the link.

       Id -> (string)
          The  random  ID string that Amazon Web Services generated as part of
          the link ARN.

       Label -> (string)
          The label that you assigned to this link,  with  the  variables  re-
          solved to their actual values.

       LabelTemplate -> (string)
          The  exact  label template that was specified when the link was cre-
          ated, with the template variables not resolved.

       LinkConfiguration -> (structure)
          This structure includes filters that specify which metric namespaces
          and which log groups are shared from the source account to the moni-
          toring account.

          LogGroupConfiguration -> (structure)
              Use this structure to filter which log groups are  to  send  log
              events from the source account to the monitoring account.

              Filter -> (string)
                 Use this field to specify which log groups are to share their
                 log events with the monitoring account.  Use  the  term  Log-
                 GroupName and one or more of the following operands. Use sin-
                 gle quotation marks (') around log group names. The  matching
                 of log group names is case sensitive. Each filter has a limit
                 of five conditional operands. Conditional  operands  are  AND
                 and OR .

                 o = and !=

                 o AND

                 o OR

                 o LIKE  and  NOT  LIKE  .  These  can  be used only as prefix
                   searches. Include a % at the end of  the  string  that  you
                   want to search for and include.

                 o IN and NOT IN , using parentheses ( )

                 Examples:

                 o LogGroupName  IN  ('This-Log-Group', 'Other-Log-Group') in-
                   cludes only the log groups with  names  This-Log-Group  and
                   Other-Log-Group .

                 o LogGroupName    NOT    IN    ('Private-Log-Group',    'Pri-
                   vate-Log-Group-2') includes all log groups except  the  log
                   groups with names Private-Log-Group and Private-Log-Group-2
                   .

                 o LogGroupName  LIKE  'aws/lambda/%'  OR  LogGroupName   LIKE
                   'AWSLogs%'  includes  all  log  groups that have names that
                   start with aws/lambda/ or AWSLogs .

                 NOTE:
                     If you are updating a link that  uses  filters,  you  can
                     specify  *  as the only value for the filter parameter to
                     delete the filter and share all log groups with the moni-
                     toring account.

          MetricConfiguration -> (structure)
              Use  this  structure to filter which metric namespaces are to be
              shared from the source account to the monitoring account.

              Filter -> (string)
                 Use this field to specify which metrics are to be shared with
                 the  monitoring  account.  Use  the term Namespace and one or
                 more of the following operands. Use  single  quotation  marks
                 (')  around  namespace names. The matching of namespace names
                 is case sensitive. Each filter has a  limit  of  five  condi-
                 tional operands. Conditional operands are AND and OR .

                 o = and !=

                 o AND

                 o OR

                 o LIKE  and  NOT  LIKE  .  These  can  be used only as prefix
                   searches. Include a % at the end of  the  string  that  you
                   want to search for and include.

                 o IN and NOT IN , using parentheses ( )

                 Examples:

                 o Namespace  NOT  LIKE  'AWS/%' includes only namespaces that
                   don't start with AWS/ , such as custom namespaces.

                 o Namespace IN ('AWS/EC2', 'AWS/ELB', 'AWS/S3') includes only
                   the  metrics in the EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, and Amazon
                   S3 namespaces.

                 o Namespace = 'AWS/EC2' OR Namespace  NOT  LIKE  'AWS/%'  in-
                   cludes only the EC2 namespace and your custom namespaces.

                 NOTE:
                     If  you  are  updating  a link that uses filters, you can
                     specify * as the only value for the filter  parameter  to
                     delete  the  filter  and share all metric namespaces with
                     the monitoring account.
