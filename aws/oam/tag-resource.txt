TAG-RESOURCE()                                                  TAG-RESOURCE()



NAME
       tag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Assigns  one  or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified resource.
       Both sinks and links can be tagged.

       Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can  also
       use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to ac-
       cess or change only resources with certain tag values.

       Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are in-
       terpreted strictly as strings of characters.

       You  can  use  the  TagResource action with a resource that already has
       tags. If you specify a new tag key for the alarm, this tag is  appended
       to the list of tags associated with the alarm. If you specify a tag key
       that is already associated with the alarm, the new tag value  that  you
       specify replaces the previous value for that tag.

       You can associate as many as 50 tags with a resource.

       WARNING:
          Unlike tagging permissions in other Amazon Web Services services, to
          tag or untag links and sinks you must have the oam:ResourceTag  per-
          mission.  The  iam:ResourceTag  permission does not allow you to tag
          and untag links and sinks.

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The ARN of the resource that you're adding tags to.

          The ARN format of a sink is
          ``
          arn:aws:oam:Region :account-id :sink/sink-id ``

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 91)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                 The ARN format of a link is
                 ``
                 arn:aws:oam:Region :account-id :link/link-id ``

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 95)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                 For more information about ARN format,  see  CloudWatch  Logs
                 resources and operations .

       --tags (map)
          The list of key-value pairs to associate with the resource.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
