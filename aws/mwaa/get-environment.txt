OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the Amazon MWAA environment. For example, MyMWAAEnviron-
          ment .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Environment -> (structure)
          An object containing all available details about the environment.

          Name -> (string)
              The  name of the Amazon MWAA environment. For example, MyMWAAEn-
              vironment .

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the Amazon MWAA environment.

              Valid values:

              o CREATING - Indicates the request to create the environment  is
                in progress.

              o CREATING_SNAPSHOT  -  Indicates the request to update environ-
                ment details,  or  upgrade  the  environment  version,  is  in
                progress and Amazon MWAA is creating a storage volume snapshot
                of the Amazon RDS database cluster associated with  the  envi-
                ronment. A database snapshot is a backup created at a specific
                point in time. Amazon MWAA uses snapshots to recover  environ-
                ment  metadata if the process to update or upgrade an environ-
                ment fails.

              o CREATE_FAILED - Indicates the request to create  the  environ-
                ment failed, and the environment could not be created.

              o AVAILABLE - Indicates the request was successful and the envi-
                ronment is ready to use.

              o PENDING -  Indicates  the  request  was  successful,  but  the
                process  to  create the environment is paused until you create
                the required VPC endpoints in your VPC. After you  create  the
                VPC endpoints, the process resumes.

              o UPDATING  - Indicates the request to update the environment is
                in progress.

              o ROLLING_BACK - Indicates the request to update environment de-
                tails,  or  upgrade the environment version, failed and Amazon
                MWAA is restoring the environment  using  the  latest  storage
                volume snapshot.

              o DELETING  - Indicates the request to delete the environment is
                in progress.

              o DELETED - Indicates the request to delete the  environment  is
                complete, and the environment has been deleted.

              o UNAVAILABLE  -  Indicates the request failed, but the environ-
                ment did not return to its previous state and is not stable.

              o UPDATE_FAILED - Indicates the request to update  the  environ-
                ment  failed, and the environment was restored to its previous
                state successfully and is ready to use.

              o MAINTENANCE - Indicates that  the  environment  is  undergoing
                maintenance. Depending on the type of work Amazon MWAA is per-
                forming, your environment might become unavailable during this
                process.  After all operations are done, your environment will
                return to its status prior to mainteneace operations.

              Source -> (string)
                 The source of the last update to  the  environment.  Includes
                 internal  processes  by  Amazon  MWAA, such as an environment
                 maintenance update.

          WeeklyMaintenanceWindowStart -> (string)
              The day and time of the week in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
              24-hour standard time that weekly maintenance updates are sched-

          Tags -> (map)
              The key-value tag pairs associated to your environment. For  ex-
              ample,  "Environment":  "Staging"  .  For  more information, see
              Tagging Amazon Web Services resources .

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          WebserverAccessMode -> (string)
              The Apache Airflow web server access mode. For more information,
              see Apache Airflow access modes .

          MinWorkers -> (integer)
              The  minimum number of workers that run in your environment. For
              example, 2 .

          Schedulers -> (integer)
              The number of Apache Airflow schedulers that run in your  Amazon
              MWAA environment.

          WebserverVpcEndpointService -> (string)

          DatabaseVpcEndpointService -> (string)
              The VPC endpoint for the environment's Amazon RDS database.

          CeleryExecutorQueue -> (string)
              The  queue  ARN  for  the environment's Celery Executor . Amazon
              MWAA uses a Celery Executor to distribute tasks across  multiple
              workers.  When  you  create  an environment in a shared VPC, you
              must provide access to the Celery Executor queue from your VPC.

          EndpointManagement -> (string)
              Defines whether the VPC endpoints configured for the environment
              are  created, and managed, by the customer or by Amazon MWAA. If
              set to SERVICE , Amazon MWAA will create and manage the required
              VPC endpoints in your VPC. If set to CUSTOMER , you must create,
              and manage, the VPC endpoints in your VPC.

          MinWebservers -> (integer)
              The minimum number of web servers that you want to run  in  your
              environment. Amazon MWAA scales the number of Apache Airflow web
              servers up to the number you specify for MaxWebservers when  you
              interact  with your Apache Airflow environment using Apache Air-
              flow REST API, or  the  Apache  Airflow  CLI.  As  the  transac-
              tion-per-second  rate,  and  the  network load, decrease, Amazon
              MWAA disposes of the additional web servers, and scales down  to
              the number set in MinxWebserers .

              Valid values: Accepts between 2 and 5 . Defaults to 2 .

          MaxWebservers -> (integer)
              The  maximum  number of web servers that you want to run in your
              environment. Amazon MWAA scales the number of Apache Airflow web
              servers  up to the number you specify for MaxWebservers when you
              interact with your Apache Airflow environment using Apache  Air-
              flow  REST  API, or the Apache Airflow CLI. For example, in sce-
              narios where your workload requires network calls to the  Apache
              Airflow  REST API with a high transaction-per-second (TPS) rate,
              Amazon MWAA will increase the number of web servers  up  to  the
              number  set  in MaxWebserers . As TPS rates decrease Amazon MWAA
              disposes of the additional web servers, and scales down  to  the
              number set in MinxWebserers .

              Valid values: Accepts between 2 and 5 . Defaults to 2 .
