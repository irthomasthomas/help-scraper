OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the Amazon MWAA environment. For example, MyMWAAEnviron-
          ment .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                of  the  Amazon RDS database cluster associated with the envi-
                ronment. A database snapshot is a backup created at a specific
                point  in time. Amazon MWAA uses snapshots to recover environ-
                ment metadata if the process to update or upgrade an  environ-
                ment fails.

              o CREATE_FAILED  -  Indicates the request to create the environ-
                ment failed, and the environment could not be created.

              o AVAILABLE - Indicates the request was successful and the envi-
                ronment is ready to use.

              o UPDATING  - Indicates the request to update the environment is
                in progress.

              o ROLLING_BACK - Indicates the request to update environment de-
                tails,  or  upgrade the environment version, failed and Amazon
                MWAA is restoring the environment  using  the  latest  storage
                volume snapshot.

              o DELETING  - Indicates the request to delete the environment is
                in progress.

              o DELETED - Indicates the request to delete the  environment  is
                complete, and the environment has been deleted.
