NAME
       list-vocabulary-filters -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  a  list of custom vocabulary filters that match the specified
       criteria. If no criteria are specified, all custom vocabularies are re-
       turned.

       To  get detailed information about a specific custom vocabulary filter,
       use the operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-vocabulary-filters
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--name-contains <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          If your ListVocabularyFilters request returns more results than  can
          be displayed, NextToken is displayed in the response with an associ-
          ated string. To get the next page of results, copy this  string  and
          repeat  your  request,  including  NextToken  with  the value of the
          copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of custom vocabulary filters to  return  in  each
          page of results. If there are fewer results than the value you spec-
          ify, only the actual results are returned. If you  don't  specify  a
          value, a default of 5 is used.

       --name-contains (string)
          Returns  only  the custom vocabulary filters that contain the speci-
          fied string. The search is not case sensitive.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If  NextToken is present in your response, it indicates that not all
          results are displayed. To view the next set  of  results,  copy  the
          string  associated with the NextToken parameter in your results out-
          put, then run your request again including NextToken with the  value
          of the copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

       VocabularyFilters -> (list)
          Provides  information about the custom vocabulary filters that match
          the criteria specified in your request.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a vocabulary  filter,  including  the
              language of the filter, when it was last modified, and its name.

              VocabularyFilterName -> (string)
                 A unique name, chosen by you, for your custom vocabulary fil-
                 ter. This name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces,  and
                 must be unique within an Amazon Web Services account.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The language code that represents the language of the entries
                 in your vocabulary filter. Each vocabulary filter  must  con-
                 tain terms in only one language.

                 A  vocabulary  filter can only be used to transcribe files in
                 the same language as the filter. For example, if you create a
                 vocabulary filter using US English (en-US ), you can only ap-
                 ply this filter to files that contain English audio.

                 For a list of supported languages and their  associated  lan-
                 guage codes, refer to the Supported languages table.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time the specified vocabulary filter was last
                 modified.

                 Timestamps are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC
                 .  For  example,  2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00 represents
                 12:32 PM UTC-7 on May 4, 2022.
