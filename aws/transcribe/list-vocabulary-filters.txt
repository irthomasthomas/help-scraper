OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          If your ListVocabularyFilters request returns more results than  can
          be displayed, NextToken is displayed in the response with an associ-
          ated string. To get the next page of results, copy this  string  and
          repeat  your  request,  including  NextToken  with  the value of the
          copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of custom vocabulary filters to  return  in  each
          page of results. If there are fewer results than the value you spec-
          ify, only the actual results are returned. If you  don't  specify  a
          value, a default of 5 is used.

       --name-contains (string)
          Returns  only  the custom vocabulary filters that contain the speci-
          fied string. The search is not case sensitive.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list your vocabulary filters

       The following list-vocabulary-filters example lists the vocabulary fil-
       ters associated with your AWS account and Region.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If NextToken is present in your response, it indicates that not  all
          results  are  displayed.  To  view the next set of results, copy the
          string associated with the NextToken parameter in your results  out-
          put,  then run your request again including NextToken with the value
          of the copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

       VocabularyFilters -> (list)
          Provides information about the custom vocabulary filters that  match
          the criteria specified in your request.

          (structure)
              Provides  information  about  a vocabulary filter, including the
              language of the filter, when it was last modified, and its name.

              VocabularyFilterName -> (string)
                 A unique name, chosen by you, for your custom vocabulary fil-
                 ter.  This name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and
                 must be unique within an Amazon Web Services account.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The language code that represents the language of the entries
                 in  your  vocabulary filter. Each vocabulary filter must con-
                 tain terms in only one language.

                 A vocabulary filter can only be used to transcribe  files  in
                 the same language as the filter. For example, if you create a
                 vocabulary filter using US English (en-US ), you can only ap-
                 ply this filter to files that contain English audio.

                 For  a  list of supported languages and their associated lan-
                 guage codes, refer to the Supported languages table.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the specified vocabulary  filter  was  last
                 modified.

                 Timestamps are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC
                 . For  example,  2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00  represents
                 12:32 PM UTC-7 on May 4, 2022.
