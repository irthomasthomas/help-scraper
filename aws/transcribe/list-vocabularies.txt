       ria. If no criteria are specified,  all  custom  vocabularies  are  re-
       turned.

       To get detailed information about a specific custom vocabulary, use the
       operation.

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          If your ListVocabularies request returns more results  than  can  be
          displayed, NextToken is displayed in the response with an associated
          string. To get the next page of results, copy this string and repeat
          your  request,  including  NextToken  with  the  value of the copied
          string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of custom vocabularies to return in each page  of
          results. If there are fewer results than the value you specify, only
          the actual results are returned. If you don't specify a value, a de-
          fault of 5 is used.

       --state-equals (string)
          Returns  only  custom vocabularies with the specified state. Vocabu-
          laries are ordered by creation  date,  with  the  newest  vocabulary
          first. If you don't include StateEquals , all custom medical vocabu-
          laries are returned.

          Possible values:

          o PENDING

          o READY

          o FAILED

       --name-contains (string)
          Returns only the custom  vocabularies  that  contain  the  specified
          string. The search is not case sensitive.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list your custom vocabularies

       The  following  list-vocabularies example lists the custom vocabularies
       associated with your AWS account and Region.

OUTPUT
       Status -> (string)
          Lists all custom vocabularies that have the status specified in your
          request. Vocabularies are ordered by creation date, with the  newest
          vocabulary first.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  NextToken is present in your response, it indicates that not all
          results are displayed. To view the next set  of  results,  copy  the
          string  associated with the NextToken parameter in your results out-
          put, then run your request again including NextToken with the  value
          of the copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

       Vocabularies -> (list)
          Provides  information  about  the custom vocabularies that match the
          criteria specified in your request.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a custom  vocabulary,  including  the
              language of the vocabulary, when it was last modified, its name,
              and the processing state.

              VocabularyName -> (string)
                 A unique name, chosen by you,  for  your  custom  vocabulary.
                 This  name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and must
                 be unique within an Amazon Web Services account.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The language code used to create your custom vocabulary. Each
                 vocabulary must contain terms in only one language.

                 A  custom  vocabulary can only be used to transcribe files in
                 the same language as the vocabulary. For example, if you cre-
                 ate  a vocabulary using US English (en-US ), you can only ap-
                 ply this vocabulary to files that contain English audio.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the specified vocabulary was last modified.

                 Timestamps are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC
                 .  For  example,  2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00 represents
                 12:32 PM UTC-7 on May 4, 2022.

              VocabularyState -> (string)
                 The processing state of your custom vocabulary. If the  state
                 is  READY  ,  you can use the vocabulary in a StartTranscrip-
                 tionJob request.
