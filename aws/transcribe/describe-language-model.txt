DESCRIBE-LANGUAGE-MODEL()                            DESCRIBE-LANGUAGE-MODEL()



NAME
       describe-language-model -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides information about the specified custom language model.

       This operation also shows if the base language model you used to create
       your custom language model has been updated. If Amazon  Transcribe  has
       updated  the base model, you can create a new custom language model us-
       ing the updated base model.

       If you tried to create a new custom  language  model  and  the  request
       wasn't  successful,  you can use DescribeLanguageModel to help identify
       the reason for this failure.

       To get a list of your custom language models, use the operation.

OPTIONS
       --model-name (string)
          The name of the custom language model you  want  information  about.
          Model names are case sensitive.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about a specific custom language model

       The  following describe-language-model example gets information about a
       specific custom language model. For example,  under  BaseModelName  you
       can  see  whether  your model is trained using a NarrowBand or WideBand
       model. Custom language models with a NarrowBand base  model  can  tran-
       scribe audio with a sample rate less than 16 kHz. Language models using
       a WideBand base model can transcribe audio with a sample  rate  greater
       than  16 kHz. The S3Uri parameter indicates the Amazon S3 prefix you've
       used to access the training data to create the custom language model.

          aws transcribe describe-language-model \
              --model-name cli-clm-example

       Output:

          {
              "LanguageModel": {
                  "ModelName": "cli-clm-example",
                  "CreateTime": "2020-09-25T17:57:38.504000+00:00",
                  "LastModifiedTime": "2020-09-25T17:57:48.585000+00:00",
                  "LanguageCode": "language-code",
                  "BaseModelName": "base-model-name",
                  "ModelStatus": "IN_PROGRESS",
                  "UpgradeAvailability": false,
                  "InputDataConfig": {
                      "S3Uri": "s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/Amazon-S3-Prefix/",
                      "TuningDataS3Uri": "s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/Amazon-S3-Prefix/",
                      "DataAccessRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::AWS-account-number:role/IAM-role-with-permissions-to-create-a-custom-language-model"
                  }
              }
          }

       Guide.

OUTPUT
       LanguageModel -> (structure)
          Provides information about the specified custom language model.

          This parameter also shows if the base language  model  you  used  to
          create  your custom language model has been updated. If Amazon Tran-
          scribe has updated the base model, you can create a new custom  lan-
          guage model using the updated base model.

          If  you  tried to create a new custom language model and the request
          wasn't successful, you can use this  DescribeLanguageModel  to  help
          identify the reason for this failure.

          ModelName -> (string)
              A unique name, chosen by you, for your custom language model.

              This  name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and must be
              unique within an Amazon Web Services account.

          CreateTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time the specified custom language model  was  cre-
              ated.

              Timestamps  are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC .
              For example, 2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00  represents  12:32
              PM UTC-7 on May 4, 2022.

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and  time the specified language model was last modi-
              fied.

              Timestamps are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC  .
              For  example,  2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00 represents 12:32
              PM UTC-7 on May 4, 2022.

          LanguageCode -> (string)
              The language code used to create  your  custom  language  model.
              Each language model must contain terms in only one language, and
              the language you select for your model must match  the  language
              of your training and tuning data.

              For  a list of supported languages and their associated language
              codes, refer to the Supported languages table.  Note  that  U.S.
              English  (en-US  )  is  the  only language supported with Amazon
              Transcribe Medical.

          BaseModelName -> (string)
              The Amazon Transcribe standard language model,  or  base  model,
              used to create your custom language model.

          ModelStatus -> (string)
              The status of the specified custom language model. When the sta-
              tus displays as COMPLETED the model is ready for use.

          UpgradeAvailability -> (boolean)
              Shows if a more current base model is available for use with the
              specified custom language model.

              If false , your language model is using the most up-to-date base
              model.

              If true , there is a newer base model  available  than  the  one
              your language model is using.

              Note  that  to update a base model, you must recreate the custom
              language model using the new base model. Base model upgrades for
              existing custom language models are not supported.

          FailureReason -> (string)
              If  ModelStatus  is  FAILED , FailureReason contains information
              about why the custom language model request  failed.  See  also:
              Common Errors .

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 location of the input files used to train and tune
              your custom language model, in addition to the data access  role
              ARN  (Amazon Resource Name) that has permissions to access these
              data.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 location (URI) of the text files  you  want  to
                 use to train your custom language model.

                 Here's     an     example     URI     path:    s3://DOC-EXAM-
                 PLE-BUCKET/my-model-training-data/

              TuningDataS3Uri -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 location (URI) of the text files  you  want  to
                 use to tune your custom language model.

                 Here's     an     example     URI     path:    s3://DOC-EXAM-
                 PLE-BUCKET/my-model-tuning-data/

              DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that  has  per-
                 missions  to  access  the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your
                 input files. If the role you specify doesnt have  the  appro-
                 priate  permissions  to  access the specified Amazon S3 loca-
                 tion, your request fails.

                 IAM  role  ARNs  have   the   format   arn:partition:iam::ac-
                 count:role/role-name-with-path       .      For      example:
                 arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Admin .

                 For more information, see IAM ARNs .
