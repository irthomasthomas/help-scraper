OPTIONS
       --status-equals (string)
          Returns only custom language models with the specified status.  Lan-
          guage  models  are  ordered  by creation date, with the newest model
          first. If you don't include StatusEquals , all custom language  mod-
          els are returned.

          Possible values:

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o FAILED

          o COMPLETED

       --name-contains (string)
          Returns  only  the custom language models that contain the specified
          string. The search is not case sensitive.

       --next-token (string)
          If your ListLanguageModels request returns more results than can  be
          displayed, NextToken is displayed in the response with an associated
          string. To get the next page of results, copy this string and repeat
          your  request,  including  NextToken  with  the  value of the copied
          string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of custom language models to return in each  page
          of results. If there are fewer results than the value that you spec-
          ify, only the actual results are returned. If you  don't  specify  a
          value, a default of 5 is used.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list your custom language models

       The  following  list-language-models  example lists the custom language
       models associated with your AWS account and Region.  You  can  use  the
       S3Uri  and  TuningDataS3Uri  parameters  to find the Amazon S3 prefixes
       you've used as your training data, or your tuning data. The  BaseModel-
       Name  tells  you whether you've used a NarrowBand, or WideBand model to
       create a custom language model. You can transcribe audio with a  sample
       rate  of  less than 16 kHz with a custom language model using a Narrow-
       Band base model. You can transcribe audio 16 kHz or greater with a cus-
       tom language model using a WideBand base model. The ModelStatus parame-
       ter shows whether you can use the custom language model in a transcrip-
       tion  job. If the value is COMPLETED, you can use it in a transcription
       job.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If NextToken is present in your response, it indicates that not  all
          results  are  displayed.  To  view the next set of results, copy the
          string associated with the NextToken parameter in your results  out-
          put,  then run your request again including NextToken with the value
          of the copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

       Models -> (list)
          Provides information about the custom language models that match the
          criteria specified in your request.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a custom language model, including:

              o The base model name

              o When the model was created

              o The location of the files used to train the model

              o When the model was last modified

              o The name you chose for the model

              o The model's language

              o The model's processing state

              o Any available upgrades for the base model

              ModelName -> (string)
                 A unique name, chosen by you, for your custom language model.

                 This  name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and must
                 be unique within an Amazon Web Services account.

              CreateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the specified  custom  language  model  was
                 created.

                 Timestamps are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC
                 . For  example,  2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00  represents
                 12:32 PM UTC-7 on May 4, 2022.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time  the specified custom language model was
                 last modified.

                 Timestamps are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC
                 .  For  example,  2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00 represents
                 12:32 PM UTC-7 on May 4, 2022.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The language code used to create your custom language  model.
                 Each  custom  language  model  must contain terms in only one
                 language, and the language you select for  your  custom  lan-
                 guage model must match the language of your training and tun-
                 ing data.

                 For a list of supported languages and their  associated  lan-
                 guage  codes,  refer  to  the Supported languages table. Note
                 that U.S. English (en-US ) is  the  only  language  supported
                 with Amazon Transcribe Medical.

              BaseModelName -> (string)
                 The Amazon Transcribe standard language model, or base model,
                 used to create your custom language model.

              ModelStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the specified custom language model.  When  the
                 status displays as COMPLETED the model is ready for use.

              UpgradeAvailability -> (boolean)
                 Shows  if a more current base model is available for use with
                 the specified custom language model.

                 If false , your custom  language  model  is  using  the  most
                 up-to-date base model.

                 If  true , there is a newer base model available than the one
                 your language model is using.

                 Note that to update a base model, you must recreate the  cus-
                 tom  language  model using the new base model. Base model up-
                 grades for existing custom language models are not supported.

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 If ModelStatus is FAILED , FailureReason contains information
                 about why the custom language model request failed. See also:
                 Common Errors .

              InputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The Amazon S3 location of the input files used to  train  and
                 tune  your custom language model, in addition to the data ac-
                 cess role ARN (Amazon Resource Name) that has permissions  to
                 access these data.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  S3 location (URI) of the text files you want
                     to use to train your custom language model.

                     Here's    an    example    URI    path:    s3://DOC-EXAM-
                     PLE-BUCKET/my-model-training-data/

                 TuningDataS3Uri -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  S3 location (URI) of the text files you want
                     to use to tune your custom language model.

                     Here's    an    example    URI    path:    s3://DOC-EXAM-
                     PLE-BUCKET/my-model-tuning-data/

                 DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of an IAM role that has
                     permissions to access the Amazon S3 bucket that  contains
                     your  input  files.  If  the role that you specify doesnt
                     have the appropriate permissions to access the  specified
                     Amazon S3 location, your request fails.

                     IAM  role  ARNs  have  the  format arn:partition:iam::ac-
                     count:role/role-name-with-path     .     For     example:
                     arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Admin .
