NAME
       list-language-models -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides a list of custom language models that match the specified cri-
       teria. If no criteria are specified, all language models are returned.

       To get detailed information about a specific custom language model, use
       the operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-language-models
          [--status-equals <value>]
          [--name-contains <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --status-equals (string)
          Returns  only custom language models with the specified status. Lan-
          guage models are ordered by creation date,  with  the  newest  model
          first.  If you don't include StatusEquals , all custom language mod-
          els are returned.

          Possible values:

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o FAILED

          o COMPLETED

       --name-contains (string)
          Returns only the custom language models that contain  the  specified
          string. The search is not case sensitive.

       --next-token (string)
          If  your ListLanguageModels request returns more results than can be
          displayed, NextToken is displayed in the response with an associated
          string. To get the next page of results, copy this string and repeat
          your request, including NextToken  with  the  value  of  the  copied
          string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of custom language models to return in each page
          of results. If there are fewer results than the value  you  specify,
          only  the actual results are returned. If you don't specify a value,
          a default of 5 is used.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list your custom language models

       The  following  list-language-models  example lists the custom language
       models associated with your AWS account and Region.  You  can  use  the
       S3Uri  and  TuningDataS3Uri  parameters  to find the Amazon S3 prefixes
       you've used as your training data, or your tuning data. The  BaseModel-
       Name  tells  you whether you've used a NarrowBand, or WideBand model to
       create a custom language model. You can transcribe audio with a  sample
       rate  of  less than 16 kHz with a custom language model using a Narrow-
       Band base model. You can transcribe audio 16 kHz or greater with a cus-
       tom language model using a WideBand base model. The ModelStatus parame-
       ter shows whether you can use the custom language model in a transcrip-
       tion  job. If the value is COMPLETED, you can use it in a transcription
       job.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If NextToken is present in your response, it indicates that not  all
          results  are  displayed.  To  view the next set of results, copy the
          string associated with the NextToken parameter in your results  out-
          put,  then run your request again including NextToken with the value
          of the copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

       Models -> (list)
          Provides information about the custom language models that match the
          criteria specified in your request.

          (structure)
              Provides  information  about  a custom language model, including
              the base model name, when the model was created, the location of
              the files used to train the model, when the model was last modi-
              fied, the name you chose for the model, its language,  its  pro-
              cessing state, and if there is an upgrade available for the base
              model.

              ModelName -> (string)
                 A unique name, chosen by you, for your custom language model.

                 This name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and  must
                 be unique within an Amazon Web Services account.

              CreateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time  the specified custom language model was
                 created.

                 Timestamps are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC
                 .  For  example,  2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00 represents
                 12:32 PM UTC-7 on May 4, 2022.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the specified language model was last modi-
                 fied.

                 Timestamps are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC
                 . For  example,  2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00  represents
                 12:32 PM UTC-7 on May 4, 2022.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The  language code used to create your custom language model.
                 Each language model must contain terms in only one  language,
                 and  the  language  you  select for your model must match the
                 language of your training and tuning data.

                 For a list of supported languages and their  associated  lan-
                 guage  codes,  refer  to  the Supported languages table. Note
                 that U.S. English (en-US ) is  the  only  language  supported
                 with Amazon Transcribe Medical.

              BaseModelName -> (string)
                 The Amazon Transcribe standard language model, or base model,
                 used to create your custom language model.

              ModelStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the specified custom language model.  When  the
                 status displays as COMPLETED the model is ready for use.

              UpgradeAvailability -> (boolean)
                 Shows  if a more current base model is available for use with
                 the specified custom language model.

                 If false , your language model is using the  most  up-to-date
                 base model.

                 If  true , there is a newer base model available than the one
                 your language model is using.

                 Note that to update a base model, you must recreate the  cus-
                 tom  language  model using the new base model. Base model up-
                 grades for existing custom language models are not supported.

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 If ModelStatus is FAILED , FailureReason contains information
                 about why the custom language model request failed. See also:
                 Common Errors .

              InputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The Amazon S3 location of the input files used to  train  and
                 tune  your custom language model, in addition to the data ac-
                 cess role ARN (Amazon Resource Name) that has permissions  to
                 access these data.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  S3 location (URI) of the text files you want
                     to use to train your custom language model.

                     Here's    an    example    URI    path:    s3://DOC-EXAM-
                     PLE-BUCKET/my-model-training-data/

                 TuningDataS3Uri -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  S3 location (URI) of the text files you want
                     to use to tune your custom language model.

                     Here's    an    example    URI    path:    s3://DOC-EXAM-
                     PLE-BUCKET/my-model-tuning-data/

                 DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of an IAM role that has
                     permissions to access the Amazon S3 bucket that  contains
                     your input files. If the role you specify doesnt have the
                     appropriate permissions to access the specified Amazon S3
                     location, your request fails.

                     IAM  role  ARNs  have  the  format arn:partition:iam::ac-
                     count:role/role-name-with-path     .     For     example:
                     arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Admin .
