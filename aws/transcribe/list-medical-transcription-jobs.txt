DESCRIPTION
       Provides  a list of medical transcription jobs that match the specified

       use the operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-medical-transcription-jobs
          [--status <value>]
          [--job-name-contains <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          Returns only medical transcription jobs with the  specified  status.
          Jobs are ordered by creation date, with the newest job first. If you
          don't include Status , all medical transcription jobs are returned.

          Possible values:

          o QUEUED

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o FAILED

          o COMPLETED

       --job-name-contains (string)
          Returns only the medical transcription jobs that contain the  speci-
          fied string. The search is not case sensitive.

       --next-token (string)
          If  your  ListMedicalTranscriptionJobs  request returns more results
          than can be displayed, NextToken is displayed in the  response  with
          an  associated  string.  To  get the next page of results, copy this
          string and repeat your request, including NextToken with  the  value
          of the copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number of medical transcription jobs to return in each
          page of results. If there are fewer results than the value you spec-
          ify,  only  the  actual results are returned. If you don't specify a
          value, a default of 5 is used.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list your medical transcription jobs

       The following list-medical-transcription-jobs example lists the medical
       transcription  jobs associated with your AWS account and Region. To get
       more information about a particular transcription job, copy  the  value
       of a MedicalTranscriptionJobName parameter in the transcription output,
       and specify that value for the  MedicalTranscriptionJobName  option  of
       the  get-medical-transcription-job  command.  To see more of your tran-
       scription jobs, copy the value of  the  NextToken  parameter,  run  the
       list-medical-transcription-jobs  command  again, and specify that value
       in the --next-token option.

                 cal transcriptions.

              TranscriptionJobStatus -> (string)
                 Provides the status of your medical transcription job.

                 If  the status is COMPLETED , the job is finished and you can
                 find the results at the  location  specified  in  Transcript-
                 FileUri  .  If  the status is FAILED , FailureReason provides
                 details on why your transcription job failed.

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 If TranscriptionJobStatus is FAILED , FailureReason  contains
                 information about why the transcription job failed. See also:
                 Common Errors .

              OutputLocationType -> (string)
                 Indicates where the specified medical transcription output is
                 stored.

                 If  the value is CUSTOMER_BUCKET , the location is the Amazon
                 S3 bucket you specified using the OutputBucketName  parameter
                 in  your  request. If you also included OutputKey in your re-
                 quest, your output is located in the path  you  specified  in
                 your request.

                 If  the  value  is  SERVICE_BUCKET  ,  the location is a ser-
                 vice-managed Amazon S3 bucket. To access a transcript  stored
                 in  a  service-managed bucket, use the URI shown in the Tran-
                 scriptFileUri field.

              Specialty -> (string)
                 Provides the medical specialty represented in your media.

              ContentIdentificationType -> (string)
