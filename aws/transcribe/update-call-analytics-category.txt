OPTIONS
       --category-name (string)
          The name of the Call Analytics category you want to update. Category
          names are case sensitive.

       --rules (list)
          The  rules  used  for the updated Call Analytics category. The rules
          you provide in this field replace the ones that are currently  being
          used in the specified category.

          (tagged union structure)
              A  rule is a set of criteria that you can specify to flag an at-
              tribute in your Call Analytics output. Rules define a Call  Ana-
              lytics category.

              Rules can include these parameters: , , , and .

                 ParticipantRole -> (string)
                     Specify the interrupter that you want to  flag.  Omitting

       --input-type (string)
          Choose whether you want to update a real-time or a  post-call  cate-
          gory. The input type you specify must match the input type specified
          when the category was created. For example, if you created  a  cate-
          gory  with  the  POST_CALL input type, you must use POST_CALL as the
          input type when updating this category.

          Possible values:

          o REAL_TIME

          o POST_CALL

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

                        instead of "speak to a manager", your content  is  not
