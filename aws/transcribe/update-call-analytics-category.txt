OPTIONS
       --category-name (string)
          The name of the Call Analytics category you want to update. Category
          names are case sensitive.

       --rules (list)
          The  rules  used  for the updated Call Analytics category. The rules
          you provide in this field replace the ones that are currently  being
          used in the specified category.

          (tagged union structure)
              A rule is a set of criteria you can specify to flag an attribute
              in your Call Analytics output. Rules  define  a  Call  Analytics
              category.

              Rules  can  include  these parameters: , , , and . To learn more
              about these parameters, refer to Rule criteria .

                 top  level  keys can be set: NonTalkTimeFilter, Interruption-
                 Filter, TranscriptFilter, SentimentFilter.

                        file. If you include StartPercentage in your  request,

                     Note that semantic matching is not supported.  For  exam-
                     ple,  if  your  customer says "speak to the manager", in-

                        searching for the specified  criteria  in  your  media
                        file.  If  you  include EndPercentage in your request,
                        you must also include StartPercentage .

                     First -> (integer)

                     specified in your request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
