NAME
       update-vocabulary -

       overwrites all existing information with your new  values;  you  cannot
       append new terms onto an existing vocabulary.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-vocabulary
          --vocabulary-name <value>
          --language-code <value>
          [--phrases <value>]
          [--vocabulary-file-uri <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --vocabulary-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  custom vocabulary you want to update. Vocabulary
          names are case sensitive.

       --language-code (string)
          The language code that represents the language of the entries in the
          custom  vocabulary  you want to update. Each vocabulary must contain
          terms in only one language.

          A custom vocabulary can only be used to transcribe files in the same
          language  as the vocabulary. For example, if you create a vocabulary
          using US English (en-US ), you can only  apply  this  vocabulary  to
          files that contain English audio.

          For  a  list  of  supported  languages and their associated language
          codes, refer to the Supported languages table.

       --phrases (list)
          Use this parameter if you want to update your vocabulary by  includ-
          ing  all  desired  terms, as comma-separated values, within your re-
          quest. The other option for updating your vocabulary is to save your
          entries  in a text file and upload them to an Amazon S3 bucket, then
          specify the location of your file using the VocabularyFileUri param-
          eter.

          Note that if you include Phrases in your request, you cannot use Vo-
          cabularyFileUri ; you must choose one or the other.

          Each language has a character set that contains all allowed  charac-
          ters  for that specific language. If you use unsupported characters,
          your vocabulary filter request fails. Refer to  Character  Sets  for
          Custom Vocabularies to get the character set for your language.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --vocabulary-file-uri (string)
          The  Amazon  S3  location of the text file that contains your custom
          vocabulary. The URI must be located in the same Amazon Web  Services
          Region as the resource you're calling.

          Here's   an   example   URI   path:   s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-vo-
          cab-file.txt

          Note that if you include VocabularyFileUri in your request, you can-
          not use the Phrases flag; you must choose one or the other.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a custom vocabulary with new terms.

       The following update-vocabulary example overwrites the  terms  used  to
       create  a custom vocabulary with the new ones that you provide. Prereq-
       uisite: to replace the terms in a custom vocabulary, you  need  a  file
       with new terms.

          aws transcribe update-vocabulary \
              --vocabulary-file-uri s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/Amazon-S3-Prefix/custom-vocabulary.txt \
              --vocabulary-name custom-vocabulary \
              --language-code language-code

       Output:

          {
              "VocabularyName": "custom-vocabulary",
              "LanguageCode": "language",
              "VocabularyState": "PENDING"
          }

       For  more information, see Custom Vocabularies in the Amazon Transcribe
       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       VocabularyName -> (string)
          The name of the updated custom vocabulary.

       LanguageCode -> (string)
          The language code you selected for your custom vocabulary.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          The date and time the specified vocabulary was last updated.

          Timestamps are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC .  For
          example,  2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00 represents 12:32 PM UTC-7
          on May 4, 2022.

       VocabularyState -> (string)
          The processing state of your custom  vocabulary.  If  the  state  is
          READY  ,  you  can use the vocabulary in a StartTranscriptionJob re-
          quest.
