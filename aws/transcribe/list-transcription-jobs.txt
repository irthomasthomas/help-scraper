OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          Returns  only transcription jobs with the specified status. Jobs are
          ordered by creation date, with the newest job first.  If  you  don't
          include Status , all transcription jobs are returned.

          Possible values:

          o QUEUED

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o FAILED

          o COMPLETED

       --job-name-contains (string)
          Returns  only  the  transcription  jobs  that  contain the specified
          string. The search is not case sensitive.

       --next-token (string)
          If your ListTranscriptionJobs request returns more results than  can
          be displayed, NextToken is displayed in the response with an associ-
          ated string. To get the next page of results, copy this  string  and
          repeat  your  request,  including  NextToken  with  the value of the
          copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of transcription jobs to return in each  page  of
          results. If there are fewer results than the value you specify, only
          the actual results are returned. If you don't specify a value, a de-
          fault of 5 is used.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       Status -> (string)
          Lists  all transcription jobs that have the status specified in your
          request. Jobs are ordered by creation  date,  with  the  newest  job
          first.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  NextToken is present in your response, it indicates that not all
          results are displayed. To view the next set  of  results,  copy  the
          string  associated with the NextToken parameter in your results out-
          put, then run your request again including NextToken with the  value
          of the copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

       TranscriptionJobSummaries -> (list)
          Provides a summary of information about each result.

          (structure)
              Provides  detailed  information  about  a specific transcription
              job.

              TranscriptionJobName -> (string)
                 The name of the transcription job. Job names are case  sensi-
                 tive  and  must  be  unique within an Amazon Web Services ac-
                 count.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the specified transcription job request was
                 made.

                 Timestamps are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC
                 . For example, 2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00 represents  a
                 transcription  job  that started processing at 12:32 PM UTC-7
                 on May 4, 2022.

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time your transcription job began processing.

                 Timestamps are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC
                 .  For example, 2022-05-04T12:32:58.789000-07:00 represents a
                 transcription job that started processing at 12:32  PM  UTC-7
                 on May 4, 2022.

              CompletionTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time the specified transcription job finished
                 processing.

                 Timestamps are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC
                 .  For example, 2022-05-04T12:33:13.922000-07:00 represents a
                 transcription job that started processing at 12:33  PM  UTC-7
                 on May 4, 2022.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The language code used to create your transcription.

              TranscriptionJobStatus -> (string)
                 Provides the status of your transcription job.

                 If  the status is COMPLETED , the job is finished and you can
                 find the results at the  location  specified  in  Transcript-
                 FileUri  (or  RedactedTranscriptFileUri  ,  if  you requested
                 transcript redaction). If the status is FAILED ,  FailureRea-
                 son provides details on why your transcription job failed.

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 If  TranscriptionJobStatus is FAILED , FailureReason contains
                 information about why the transcription job failed. See also:
                 Common Errors .

              OutputLocationType -> (string)
                 Indicates where the specified transcription output is stored.

                 If  the value is CUSTOMER_BUCKET , the location is the Amazon
                 S3 bucket you specified using the OutputBucketName  parameter
                 in  your  request. If you also included OutputKey in your re-
                 quest, your output is located in the path  you  specified  in
                 your request.

                 If  the  value  is  SERVICE_BUCKET  ,  the location is a ser-
                 vice-managed Amazon S3 bucket. To access a transcript  stored
                 in  a  service-managed bucket, use the URI shown in the Tran-
                 scriptFileUri or RedactedTranscriptFileUri field.

              ContentRedaction -> (structure)
                 The content redaction settings of the transcription job.

                 RedactionType -> (string)
                     Specify the category of information you want  to  redact;
                     PII  (personally  identifiable  information)  is the only
                     valid value. You can use PiiEntityTypes to  choose  which
                     types of PII you want to redact.

                 RedactionOutput -> (string)
                     Specify if you want only a redacted transcript, or if you
                     want a redacted and an unredacted transcript.

                     When you choose redacted Amazon Transcribe creates only a
                     redacted transcript.

                     When you choose redacted_and_unredacted Amazon Transcribe
                     creates a redacted and an unredacted transcript  (as  two
                     separate files).

                 PiiEntityTypes -> (list)
                     Specify  which  types of personally identifiable informa-
                     tion (PII) you want to redact in your transcript. You can
                     include  as  many  types as you'd like, or you can select
                     ALL .

                     (string)

              ModelSettings -> (structure)
                 Provides the name of the custom language model that  was  in-
                 cluded in the specified transcription job.

                 Only use ModelSettings with the LanguageModelName sub-parame-
                 ter if you're not using automatic language identification ().
                 If  using  LanguageIdSettings in your request, this parameter
                 contains a LanguageModelName sub-parameter.

                 LanguageModelName -> (string)
                     The name of the custom language model  you  want  to  use
                     when  processing  your  transcription job. Note that lan-
                     guage model names are case sensitive.

                     The language of the specified language model  must  match
                     the  language  code you specify in your transcription re-
                     quest. If the languages don't match, the  language  model
                     isn't applied. There are no errors or warnings associated
                     with a language mismatch.

              IdentifyLanguage -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether automatic language identification  was  en-
                 abled (TRUE ) for the specified transcription job.

              IdentifyMultipleLanguages -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether automatic multi-language identification was
                 enabled (TRUE ) for the specified transcription job.

              IdentifiedLanguageScore -> (float)
                 The confidence score associated with the language  identified
                 in your media file.

                 Confidence  scores are values between 0 and 1; a larger value
                 indicates a higher probability that the  identified  language
                 correctly matches the language spoken in your media.

              LanguageCodes -> (list)
                 The  language  codes  used  to create your transcription job.
                 This parameter is used  with  multi-language  identification.
                 For  single-language  identification, the singular version of
                 this parameter, LanguageCode , is present.

                 (structure)
                     Provides information on the speech contained  in  a  dis-
                     creet utterance when multi-language identification is en-
                     abled in your request. This utterance represents a  block
                     of  speech  consisting  of one language, preceded or fol-
                     lowed by a block of speech in a different language.

                     LanguageCode -> (string)
                        Provides the language code for each  language  identi-
                        fied in your media.

                     DurationInSeconds -> (float)
                        Provides  the  total time, in seconds, each identified
                        language is spoken in your media.
