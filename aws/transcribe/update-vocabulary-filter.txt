UPDATE-VOCABULARY-FILTER()                          UPDATE-VOCABULARY-FILTER()



NAME
       update-vocabulary-filter -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  an existing custom vocabulary filter with a new list of words.
       The new list you provide overwrites all previous  entries;  you  cannot
       append new terms onto an existing vocabulary filter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-vocabulary-filter
          --vocabulary-filter-name <value>
          [--words <value>]
          [--vocabulary-filter-file-uri <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --vocabulary-filter-name (string)
          The name of the custom vocabulary filter you want to update. Vocabu-
          lary filter names are case sensitive.

       --words (list)
          Use this parameter if you want to update your vocabulary  filter  by
          including  all desired terms, as comma-separated values, within your
          request. The other option for updating your vocabulary filter is  to
          save  your  entries  in  a text file and upload them to an Amazon S3
          bucket, then specify the location of your file using the Vocabulary-
          FilterFileUri parameter.

          Note  that  if you include Words in your request, you cannot use Vo-
          cabularyFilterFileUri ; you must choose one or the other.

          Each language has a character set that contains all allowed  charac-
          ters  for that specific language. If you use unsupported characters,
          your vocabulary filter request fails. Refer to  Character  Sets  for
          Custom Vocabularies to get the character set for your language.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --vocabulary-filter-file-uri (string)
          The  Amazon  S3  location of the text file that contains your custom
          vocabulary filter terms. The URI must be located in the same  Amazon
          Web Services Region as the resource you're calling.

          Here's  an  example  URI path: s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-vocab-fil-
          ter-file.txt

          Note that if you include VocabularyFilterFileUri  in  your  request,
          you cannot use Words ; you must choose one or the other.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To replace the words in a vocabulary filter

       The following update-vocabulary-filter example replaces the words in  a
       vocabulary  filter  with new ones. Prerequisite: To update a vocabulary
       filter with the new words, you must have those words saved  as  a  text
       file.

          aws transcribe update-vocabulary-filter \
              --vocabulary-filter-file-uri s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/Amazon-S3-Prefix/your-text-file-to-update-your-vocabulary-filter.txt \
              --vocabulary-filter-name vocabulary-filter-name

       Output:

          {
              "VocabularyFilterName": "vocabulary-filter-name",
              "LanguageCode": "language-code",
              "LastModifiedTime": "2020-09-23T18:40:35.139000+00:00"
          }

          The language code you selected for your vocabulary filter.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
