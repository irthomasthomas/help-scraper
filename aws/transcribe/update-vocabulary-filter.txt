OPTIONS
       --vocabulary-filter-name (string)
          The  name of the custom vocabulary filter you want to update. Custom
          vocabulary filter names are case sensitive.

       --words (list)
          Use this parameter if you want to update your custom vocabulary fil-
          ter  by  including  all  desired  terms,  as comma-separated values,
          within your request. The other option for updating  your  vocabulary
          filter  is to save your entries in a text file and upload them to an
          Amazon S3 bucket, then specify the location of your file  using  the
          VocabularyFilterFileUri parameter.

          Note  that  if you include Words in your request, you cannot use Vo-
          cabularyFilterFileUri ; you must choose one or the other.

          Each language has a character set that contains all allowed  charac-
          ters  for that specific language. If you use unsupported characters,
          your custom vocabulary filter request fails. Refer to Character Sets
          for Custom Vocabularies to get the character set for your language.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --vocabulary-filter-file-uri (string)
          The  Amazon  S3  location of the text file that contains your custom
          vocabulary filter terms. The URI must be located in the same  Amazon
          Web Services Region as the resource you're calling.

          Here's  an  example  URI path: s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-vocab-fil-
          ter-file.txt

          Note that if you include VocabularyFilterFileUri  in  your  request,
          you cannot use Words ; you must choose one or the other.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To replace the words in a vocabulary filter

       The  following update-vocabulary-filter example replaces the words in a
       vocabulary filter with new ones. Prerequisite: To update  a  vocabulary
       filter  with  the  new words, you must have those words saved as a text
       file.

          aws transcribe update-vocabulary-filter \
              --vocabulary-filter-file-uri s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/Amazon-S3-Prefix/your-text-file-to-update-your-vocabulary-filter.txt \
              --vocabulary-filter-name vocabulary-filter-name

       Output:

          {
              "VocabularyFilterName": "vocabulary-filter-name",
              "LanguageCode": "language-code",
              "LastModifiedTime": "2020-09-23T18:40:35.139000+00:00"
          }

       For more information, see Filtering Unwanted Words in the Amazon  Tran-
       scribe Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       VocabularyFilterName -> (string)
          The name of the updated custom vocabulary filter.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
