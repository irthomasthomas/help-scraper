       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-medical-transcription-job
          --medical-transcription-job-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --medical-transcription-job-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  medical  transcription  job you want information
          about. Job names are case sensitive.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a specific medical transcription job

       The  following  get-medical-transcription-job  example gets information
       about a specific medical transcription job. To access the transcription
       results,  use  the TranscriptFileUri parameter. If you've enabled addi-
       tional features for the transcription job, you can see them in the Set-
       tings  object.  The  Specialty parameter shows the medical specialty of
       the provider. The Type parameter indicates whether the  speech  in  the
       transcription job is of a medical conversation, or a medical dictation.

              Describes  the  Amazon S3 location of the media file you want to
              use in your request.

              MediaFileUri -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 location of the media file you  want  to  tran-
                 scribe. For example:

                 o s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-media-file.flac

                 o s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/media-files/my-media-file.flac

                 Note that the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input media
                 must be located in the same Amazon Web Services Region  where
                 you're making your transcription request.

              RedactedMediaFileUri -> (string)

                 must  be located in the same Amazon Web Services Region where
                 you're making your transcription request.

                 WARNING:
                     RedactedMediaFileUri is only supported for Call Analytics
                     (StartCallAnalyticsJob ) transcription requests.

          Transcript -> (structure)
              Provides  you  with the Amazon S3 URI you can use to access your
              transcript.

              TranscriptFileUri -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 location of your transcript. You can  use  this
                 URI to access or download your transcript.

                 If  you  included  OutputBucketName in your transcription job
                 request, this is the URI of that bucket. If you also included
                 OutputKey in your request, your output is located in the path
                 you specified in your request.

                 If you didn't include OutputBucketName in your  transcription
                 job  request,  your transcript is stored in a service-managed
                 bucket, and TranscriptFileUri provides you with  a  temporary
                 URI you can use for secure access to your transcript.

                 NOTE:
                     Temporary  URIs for service-managed Amazon S3 buckets are
                     only valid for 15 minutes. If you get an AccesDenied  er-
                     ror,  you  can  get a new temporary URI by running a Get-
                     TranscriptionJob or ListTranscriptionJob request.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time the specified medical transcription job  began
              processing.

              Timestamps  are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC .
              For example, 2022-05-04T12:32:58.789000-07:00 represents a tran-
              scription  job  that started processing at 12:32 PM UTC-7 on May
              4, 2022.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time the specified medical  transcription  job  re-
              quest was made.

              Timestamps  are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC .
              For example, 2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00 represents a tran-
              scription  job  that started processing at 12:32 PM UTC-7 on May

              scription  job  that started processing at 12:33 PM UTC-7 on May
              4, 2022.

          FailureReason -> (string)
              If TranscriptionJobStatus is FAILED , FailureReason contains in-
              formation about why the transcription job request failed.

              The FailureReason field contains one of the following values:

              o Unsupported media format . The media format specified in Medi-
                aFormat isn't valid. Refer to MediaFormat for a list  of  sup-
                ported formats.

              o The  media  format  provided does not match the detected media
                format . The media format  specified  in  MediaFormat  doesn't
                match  the format of the input file. Check the media format of
                your media file and correct the specified value.

              o Invalid sample rate for audio file . The sample rate specified
                in  MediaSampleRateHertz  isn't valid. The sample rate must be
                between 16,000 and 48,000 Hertz.

              o The sample rate provided does not match  the  detected  sample
                rate  .  The  sample  rate  specified  in MediaSampleRateHertz
                doesn't match the sample rate detected  in  your  input  media
                file. Check the sample rate of your media file and correct the
                specified value.

              o Invalid file size: file size too large . The size of your  me-
                dia  file  is  larger than what Amazon Transcribe can process.
                For more information, refer to Guidelines and quotas .

              o Invalid number of channels: number of  channels  too  large  .
                Your  audio  contains  more channels than Amazon Transcribe is
                able to process. For more information, refer to Guidelines and
                quotas .

          Settings -> (structure)
              Specify  additional optional settings in your request, including
              channel identification, alternative transcriptions, and  speaker
              labeling;  allows you to apply custom vocabularies to your medi-
              cal transcription job.

              ShowSpeakerLabels -> (boolean)
                 Enables speaker identification (diarization)  in  your  tran-
                 scription  output.  Speaker  identification labels the speech
                 from individual speakers in your media file.

                 If you enable ShowSpeakerLabels in  your  request,  you  must
                 also include MaxSpeakerLabels .

                 You can't include both ShowSpeakerLabels and ChannelIdentifi-
                 cation in the same request. Including both parameters returns
                 a BadRequestException .

                 For  more information, see Identifying speakers (diarization)
                 .

              MaxSpeakerLabels -> (integer)
                 Specify the maximum number of speakers you want  to  identify
                 in your media.

                 Note that if your media contains more speakers than the spec-
                 ified number, multiple speakers will be identified as a  sin-
                 gle speaker.

                 If  you  specify the MaxSpeakerLabels field, you must set the
                 ShowSpeakerLabels field to true.

              ChannelIdentification -> (boolean)
                 Enables channel identification in multi-channel audio.

                 Channel identification transcribes the audio on each  channel
                 independently,  then appends the output for each channel into
                 one transcript.

                 If you have multi-channel audio and  do  not  enable  channel
                 identification,  your  audio  is  transcribed in a continuous
                 manner and your transcript does not separate  the  speech  by
                 channel.

                 You can't include both ShowSpeakerLabels and ChannelIdentifi-
                 cation in the same request. Including both parameters returns
                 a BadRequestException .

                 For more information, see Transcribing multi-channel audio .

              ShowAlternatives -> (boolean)
                 To  include alternative transcriptions within your transcrip-
                 tion output, include ShowAlternatives in  your  transcription
                 request.

                 If  you include ShowAlternatives , you must also include Max-
                 Alternatives , which is the  maximum  number  of  alternative
                 transcriptions  you  want Amazon Transcribe Medical to gener-
                 ate.

                 For more information, see Alternative transcriptions .

              MaxAlternatives -> (integer)
                 Indicate the maximum number of alternative transcriptions you
                 want Amazon Transcribe Medical to include in your transcript.

                 If you select a number greater than the number of alternative
                 transcriptions generated by Amazon Transcribe  Medical,  only
                 the actual number of alternative transcriptions are included.

                 If you include MaxAlternatives in your request, you must also
                 include ShowAlternatives with a value of true .

                 For more information, see Alternative transcriptions .

              VocabularyName -> (string)
                 The name of the custom vocabulary you want to use  when  pro-
                 cessing  your medical transcription job. Vocabulary names are
                 case sensitive.

                 The language of the specified vocabulary must match the  lan-
                 guage  code you specify in your transcription request. If the
                 languages don't match, the vocabulary  isn't  applied.  There
                 are  no  errors  or  warnings associated with a language mis-
                 match. US English (en-US ) is the  only  valid  language  for
                 Amazon Transcribe Medical.

          ContentIdentificationType -> (string)
              Labels  all personal health information (PHI) identified in your
              transcript.  For  more  information,  see  Identifying  personal
              health information (PHI) in a transcription .

          Specialty -> (string)
              Describes the medical specialty represented in your media.

          Type -> (string)
              Indicates  whether the input media is a dictation or a conversa-
              tion, as specified in the StartMedicalTranscriptionJob request.

          Tags -> (list)
              The tags, each in the form of a key:value pair, assigned to  the
              specified medical transcription job.

              (structure)
                 Adds metadata, in the form of a key:value pair, to the speci-
                 fied resource.

                 For example, you could add the tag Department:Sales to a  re-
                 source  to  indicate  that it pertains to your organization's
                 sales department. You can also use tags for tag-based  access
                 control.

                 To learn more about tagging, see Tagging resources .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The first part of a key:value pair that forms a tag asso-
                     ciated with a given resource. For example, in the tag De-
                     partment:Sales , the key is 'Department'.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag as-
                     sociated with a given resource. For example, in  the  tag
                     Department:Sales , the value is 'Sales'.

                     Note  that  you  can  set  the value of a tag to an empty
                     string, but you can't set the value of  a  tag  to  null.
                     Omitting  the  tag  value  is  the same as using an empty
                     string.
