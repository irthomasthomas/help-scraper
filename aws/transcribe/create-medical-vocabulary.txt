CREATE-MEDICAL-VOCABULARY()                        CREATE-MEDICAL-VOCABULARY()



NAME
       create-medical-vocabulary -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new custom medical vocabulary.

       When  creating  a  new  medical vocabulary, you must upload a text file
       that contains your new entries, phrases, and terms into an  S3  bucket.
       Note  that  this  differs  from , where you can include a list of terms
       within your request using the Phrases flag, as  CreateMedicalVocabulary
       does not support the Phrases flag.

       For  more  information  on  creating a custom vocabulary text file, see
       Creating a custom vocabulary .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-medical-vocabulary
          --vocabulary-name <value>
          --language-code <value>
          --vocabulary-file-uri <value>
          [--tags <value>]

OPTIONS
       --vocabulary-name (string)
          The name of your new vocabulary.

          This name is case sensitive, cannot  contain  spaces,  and  must  be
          unique within an Amazon Web Services account. If you try to create a
          vocabulary with the same name as a previous vocabulary,  you  get  a
          ConflictException error.

       --language-code (string)
          The  language  code  that  represents the language of the entries in
          your custom vocabulary. Note that U.S. English (en-US ) is the  only
          language supported with Amazon Transcribe Medical.

       --vocabulary-file-uri (string)
          The  Amazon  S3  location  (URI) of the text file that contains your
          custom vocabulary. The URI must be in the same Amazon  Web  Services
          Region as the resource that you're calling.

          Here's an example URI path:
              https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-s3-bucket/my-vo-
              cab-file.txt

       --tags (list)
          Adds one or more tags, each in the form of a key:value  pair,  to  a
          new medical vocabulary at the time you create the new vocabulary.

          To  learn  more  about  using  tags with Amazon Transcribe, refer to
          Tagging resources .

          (structure)
              A key:value pair that adds metadata to a resource used by Amazon
              Transcribe.  For  example, a tag with the key:value pair Depart-
              ment:Sales might be added to a resource to indicate its  use  by
              your organization's sales department.

              Key -> (string)
                 The  first  part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For example, in the  tag  Depart-
                 ment:Sales, the key is 'Department'.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For example, in the  tag  Depart-
                 ment:Sales, the value is 'Sales'.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a medical custom vocabulary

       The following create-medical-vocabulary example creates a custom vocab-
       ulary. To create a custom vocabulary, you must have created a text file
       with all the terms that you want to transcribe more accurately. For vo-
       cabulary-file-uri,  specify  the  Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon
       S3) URI of that text file. For language-code, specify a  language  code
       corresponding  to  the  language of your custom vocabulary. For vocabu-
       lary-name, specify what you want to call your custom vocabulary.

          aws transcribe create-medical-vocabulary \
              --vocabulary-name cli-medical-vocab-example \
              --language-code language-code \
              --vocabulary-file-uri https://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET.AWS-Region.amazonaws.com/the-text-file-for-the-medical-custom-vocabulary.txt

       Output:

          {
              "VocabularyName": "cli-medical-vocab-example",
              "LanguageCode": "language-code",
              "VocabularyState": "PENDING"
          }

       For more information, see Medical Custom  Vocabularies  in  the  Amazon
       Transcribe Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       VocabularyName -> (string)
          The name you chose for your vocabulary.

       LanguageCode -> (string)
          The  language  code  you  selected for your medical vocabulary. Note
          that U.S. English (en-US ) is the only language supported with  Ama-
          zon Transcribe Medical.

       VocabularyState -> (string)
          The processing state of your custom medical vocabulary. If the state
          is READY , you can use the vocabulary  in  a  StartMedicalTranscrip-
          tionJob request.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          The date and time you created your custom medical vocabulary.

       FailureReason -> (string)
          If  the VocabularyState field is FAILED , FailureReason contains in-
          formation about why the job failed.
