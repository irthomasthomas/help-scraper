CREATE-MEDICAL-VOCABULARY()                        CREATE-MEDICAL-VOCABULARY()



NAME
       create-medical-vocabulary -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new custom medical vocabulary.

       Prior  to  creating  a  new medical vocabulary, you must first upload a
       text file that contains your new entries, phrases, and  terms  into  an
       Amazon S3 bucket. Note that this differs from , where you can include a
       list of terms within your request using the Phrases  flag;  CreateMedi-
       calVocabulary does not support the Phrases flag.

       Each  language has a character set that contains all allowed characters
       for that specific language. If you use unsupported characters, your vo-
       cabulary request fails. Refer to Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies
       to get the character set for your language.

       For more information, see Creating a custom vocabulary .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-medical-vocabulary
          --vocabulary-name <value>
          --language-code <value>
          --vocabulary-file-uri <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --vocabulary-name (string)
          A unique name, chosen by you, for your new  custom  medical  vocabu-
          lary.

          This  name  is  case  sensitive,  cannot contain spaces, and must be
          unique within an Amazon Web Services account. If you try to create a
          new medical vocabulary with the same name as an existing medical vo-
          cabulary, you get a ConflictException error.

       --language-code (string)
          The language code that represents the language  of  the  entries  in
          your  custom  vocabulary.  US  English (en-US ) is the only language
          supported with Amazon Transcribe Medical.

       --vocabulary-file-uri (string)
          The Amazon S3 location (URI) of the text  file  that  contains  your
          custom  medical  vocabulary.  The URI must be in the same Amazon Web
          Services Region as the resource you're calling.

          Here's   an   example   URI   path:   s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-vo-
          cab-file.txt

       --tags (list)
          Adds  one or more custom tags, each in the form of a key:value pair,
          to a new medical vocabulary at the time you create this new  vocabu-
          lary.

          To  learn  more  about  using  tags with Amazon Transcribe, refer to
          Tagging resources .

          (structure)
              Adds metadata, in the form of a key:value pair, to the specified
              resource.

              For  example,  you  could  add the tag Department:Sales to a re-
              source to indicate that it pertains to your organization's sales
              department. You can also use tags for tag-based access control.

              To learn more about tagging, see Tagging resources .

              Key -> (string)
                 The  first  part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For example, in the  tag  Depart-
                 ment:Sales , the key is 'Department'.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For example, in the  tag  Depart-
                 ment:Sales , the value is 'Sales'.

                 Note  that you can set the value of a tag to an empty string,
                 but you can't set the value of a tag to  null.  Omitting  the
                 tag value is the same as using an empty string.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a medical custom vocabulary

       The following create-medical-vocabulary example creates a custom vocab-
       ulary. To create a custom vocabulary, you must have created a text file
       with all the terms that you want to transcribe more accurately. For vo-
       cabulary-file-uri,  specify  the  Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon
       S3) URI of that text file. For language-code, specify a  language  code
       corresponding  to  the  language of your custom vocabulary. For vocabu-
       lary-name, specify what you want to call your custom vocabulary.

          aws transcribe create-medical-vocabulary \
              --vocabulary-name cli-medical-vocab-example \
              --language-code language-code \
              --vocabulary-file-uri https://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET.AWS-Region.amazonaws.com/the-text-file-for-the-medical-custom-vocabulary.txt

       Output:

          {
              "VocabularyName": "cli-medical-vocab-example",
              "LanguageCode": "language-code",
              "VocabularyState": "PENDING"
          }

       For more information, see Medical Custom  Vocabularies  in  the  Amazon
       Transcribe Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       VocabularyName -> (string)
          The name you chose for your custom medical vocabulary.

       LanguageCode -> (string)
          The  language code you selected for your medical vocabulary. US Eng-
          lish (en-US ) is the only language supported with Amazon  Transcribe
          Medical.

       VocabularyState -> (string)
          The processing state of your custom medical vocabulary. If the state
          is READY , you can use the vocabulary  in  a  StartMedicalTranscrip-
          tionJob request.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          The date and time you created your custom medical vocabulary.

          Timestamps  are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC . For
          example, 2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00 represents 12:32 PM  UTC-7
          on May 4, 2022.

       FailureReason -> (string)
          If  VocabularyState  is  FAILED , FailureReason contains information
          about why the medical transcription job request  failed.  See  also:
          Common Errors .
