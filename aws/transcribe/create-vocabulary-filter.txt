SYNOPSIS
            create-vocabulary-filter
          --vocabulary-filter-name <value>
          --language-code <value>
          [--words <value>]
          [--vocabulary-filter-file-uri <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --vocabulary-filter-name (string)
          The name of your new vocabulary filter.

          This  name  is  case  sensitive,  cannot contain spaces, and must be
          unique within an Amazon Web Services account. If you try to create a
          vocabulary  filter  with the same name as a previous vocabulary fil-
          ter, you get a ConflictException error.

       --language-code (string)
          The language code of the words in the vocabulary filter.  All  words
          in  the  filter  must be in the same language. The vocabulary filter
          can only be used with transcription jobs in the specified language.

       --words (list)
          The words you want in your vocabulary filter.  Only  use  characters
          specified  in  the Character sets for the language you're transcrib-
          ing.

          Note that if you include Words in your request, you cannot  use  Vo-
          cabularyFilterFileUri ; you must choose one or the other.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --vocabulary-filter-file-uri (string)
          The  Amazon  S3  location of a text file used as input to create the
          vocabulary filter. Only use characters from the  character  set  de-
          fined  for  custom  vocabularies.  For a list of character sets, see
          Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies .

          Your vocabulary filter file must be less than 50 KB in size.

          Note that if you include VocabularyFilterFileUri  in  your  request,
          you cannot use Words ; you must choose one or the other.

       --tags (list)
          Adds  one  or  more tags, each in the form of a key:value pair, to a
          new vocabulary filter at the time you  create  this  new  vocabulary
          filter.

          (structure)
              A key:value pair that adds metadata to a resource used by Amazon
              Transcribe. For example, a tag with the key:value  pair  Depart-
              ment:Sales  might  be added to a resource to indicate its use by
              your organization's sales department.

              Key -> (string)
                 The first part of a key:value pair that forms a  tag  associ-
                 ated  with  a given resource. For example, in the tag Depart-
                 ment:Sales, the key is 'Department'.

              Value -> (string)
                 The second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag  associ-
                 ated  with  a given resource. For example, in the tag Depart-
                 ment:Sales, the value is 'Sales'.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a vocabulary filter

       The  following  create-vocabulary-filter  example  creates a vocabulary
       filter that uses a text file that contains a list  of  words  that  you
       wouldn't  want to appear in a transcription. For language-code, specify
       the language code corresponding to the language of your vocabulary fil-
       ter.  For vocabulary-filter-file-uri, specify the Amazon Simple Storage
       Service (Amazon S3) URI of the text file.  For  vocabulary-filter-name,
       specify the name of your vocabulary filter.

          aws transcribe create-vocabulary-filter \
              --language-code language-code \
              --vocabulary-filter-file-uri s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/vocabulary-filter.txt \
              --vocabulary-filter-name cli-vocabulary-filter-example

       Output:

          {
              "VocabularyFilterName": "cli-vocabulary-filter-example",
              "LanguageCode": "language-code"
          }

       For  more information, see Filtering Unwanted Words in the Amazon Tran-
       scribe Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       VocabularyFilterName -> (string)
          The name of the vocabulary filter.

       LanguageCode -> (string)
          The language code associated with your vocabulary filter.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          The date and time the vocabulary filter was modified.
