CREATE-VOCABULARY-FILTER()                          CREATE-VOCABULARY-FILTER()



NAME
       create-vocabulary-filter -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new custom vocabulary filter.

       You can use custom vocabulary filters to mask, delete, or flag specific
       words from your transcript. Custom vocabulary filters are commonly used
       to mask profanity in transcripts.

       Each  language has a character set that contains all allowed characters
       for that specific language. If you  use  unsupported  characters,  your
       custom  vocabulary  filter  request  fails. Refer to Character Sets for
       Custom Vocabularies to get the character set for your language.

       For more information, see Vocabulary filtering .

OPTIONS
       --vocabulary-filter-name (string)
          A unique name, chosen by you, for your new custom vocabulary filter.

          This name is case sensitive, cannot  contain  spaces,  and  must  be
          unique within an Amazon Web Services account. If you try to create a
          new custom vocabulary filter with the same name as an existing  cus-
          tom vocabulary filter, you get a ConflictException error.

       --language-code (string)
          The  language  code  that  represents the language of the entries in
          your vocabulary filter. Each custom vocabulary filter  must  contain
          terms in only one language.

          A  custom  vocabulary filter can only be used to transcribe files in
          the same language as the filter. For example, if you create a custom
          vocabulary filter using US English (en-US ), you can only apply this
          filter to files that contain English audio.

          For a list of supported  languages  and  their  associated  language
          codes, refer to the Supported languages table.

       --words (list)
          Use this parameter if you want to create your custom vocabulary fil-
          ter by including  all  desired  terms,  as  comma-separated  values,
          within  your  request. The other option for creating your vocabulary
          filter is to save your entries in a text file and upload them to  an
          Amazon  S3  bucket, then specify the location of your file using the
          VocabularyFilterFileUri parameter.

          Note that if you include Words in your request, you cannot  use  Vo-
          cabularyFilterFileUri ; you must choose one or the other.

          Each  language has a character set that contains all allowed charac-
          ters for that specific language. If you use unsupported  characters,
          your custom vocabulary filter request fails. Refer to Character Sets
          for Custom Vocabularies to get the character set for your language.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --vocabulary-filter-file-uri (string)
          The Amazon S3 location of the text file that  contains  your  custom
          vocabulary  filter terms. The URI must be located in the same Amazon
          Web Services Region as the resource you're calling.

          Here's an example  URI  path:  s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-vocab-fil-
          ter-file.txt

          Note  that  if  you include VocabularyFilterFileUri in your request,
          you cannot use Words ; you must choose one or the other.

       --tags (list)
          Adds one or more custom tags, each in the form of a key:value  pair,
          to  a  new  custom vocabulary filter at the time you create this new
          vocabulary filter.

          To learn more about using tags  with  Amazon  Transcribe,  refer  to
          Tagging resources .

          (structure)
              Adds metadata, in the form of a key:value pair, to the specified
              resource.

              For example, you could add the tag  Department:Sales  to  a  re-
              source to indicate that it pertains to your organization's sales
              department. You can also use tags for tag-based access control.

              To learn more about tagging, see Tagging resources .

              Key -> (string)
                 The first part of a key:value pair that forms a  tag  associ-
                 ated  with  a given resource. For example, in the tag Depart-
                 ment:Sales , the key is 'Department'.

              Value -> (string)
                 The second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag  associ-
                 ated  with  a given resource. For example, in the tag Depart-
                 ment:Sales , the value is 'Sales'.

                 Note that you can set the value of a tag to an empty  string,
                 but  you  can't  set the value of a tag to null. Omitting the
                 tag value is the same as using an empty string.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a vocabulary filter

       The following create-vocabulary-filter  example  creates  a  vocabulary
       filter  that  uses  a  text file that contains a list of words that you
       wouldn't want to appear in a transcription. For language-code,  specify
       the language code corresponding to the language of your vocabulary fil-
       ter. For vocabulary-filter-file-uri, specify the Amazon Simple  Storage
       Service  (Amazon  S3) URI of the text file. For vocabulary-filter-name,
       specify the name of your vocabulary filter.

          aws transcribe create-vocabulary-filter \
              --language-code language-code \
              --vocabulary-filter-file-uri s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/vocabulary-filter.txt \
              --vocabulary-filter-name cli-vocabulary-filter-example

       Output:

          {
              "VocabularyFilterName": "cli-vocabulary-filter-example",
              "LanguageCode": "language-code"
          }

       For more information, see Filtering Unwanted Words in the Amazon  Tran-
       scribe Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       VocabularyFilterName -> (string)
          The name you chose for your custom vocabulary filter.

       LanguageCode -> (string)
          The language code you selected for your custom vocabulary filter.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          The date and time you created your custom vocabulary filter.

          Timestamps  are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC . For
          example, 2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00 represents 12:32 PM  UTC-7
          on May 4, 2022.
