DESCRIPTION
       Provides a list of custom medical vocabularies that match the specified

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-medical-vocabularies
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--state-equals <value>]
          [--name-contains <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          If your ListMedicalVocabularies request returns  more  results  than
          can be displayed, NextToken is displayed in the response with an as-
          sociated string. To get the next page of results, copy  this  string
          and  repeat  your request, including NextToken with the value of the
          copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of custom medical vocabularies to return in  each
          page of results. If there are fewer results than the value you spec-
          ify, only the actual results are returned. If you  don't  specify  a
          value, a default of 5 is used.

       --state-equals (string)
          Returns  only  custom medical vocabularies with the specified state.
          Vocabularies are ordered by creation date, with the  newest  vocabu-
          lary  first.  If  you don't include StateEquals , all custom medical
          vocabularies are returned.

          Possible values:

          o PENDING

          o READY

          o FAILED

       --name-contains (string)
          Returns only the custom medical vocabularies that contain the speci-
          fied string. The search is not case sensitive.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list your medical custom vocabularies

       The following list-medical-vocabularies example lists the medical  cus-
       tom  vocabularies  associated  with your AWS account and Region. To get
       more information about a particular transcription job, copy  the  value
       of a MedicalTranscriptionJobName parameter in the transcription output,
       and specify that value for the  MedicalTranscriptionJobName  option  of
       the  get-medical-transcription-job  command.  To see more of your tran-
       scription jobs, copy the value of  the  NextToken  parameter,  run  the
       list-medical-transcription-jobs  command  again, and specify that value
       in the --next-token option.

          aws transcribe list-medical-vocabularies

       Output:

          {
              "Vocabularies": [
                  {
                      "VocabularyName": "cli-medical-vocab-2",
                      "LanguageCode": "en-US",
                      "LastModifiedTime": "2020-09-21T21:44:59.521000+00:00",
                      "VocabularyState": "READY"
                  },
                  {
                      "VocabularyName": "cli-medical-vocab-1",

              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Status -> (string)
          Lists all custom medical vocabularies that have the status specified
          in your request. Vocabularies are ordered by creation date, with the
          newest vocabulary first.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  NextToken is present in your response, it indicates that not all
          results are displayed. To view the next set  of  results,  copy  the
          string  associated with the NextToken parameter in your results out-
          put, then run your request again including NextToken with the  value
          of the copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

       Vocabularies -> (list)
          Provides  information  about  the  custom  medical vocabularies that
          match the criteria specified in your request.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a custom  vocabulary,  including  the
              language of the vocabulary, when it was last modified, its name,
              and the processing state.

              VocabularyName -> (string)
                 A unique name, chosen by you,  for  your  custom  vocabulary.
                 This  name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and must
                 be unique within an Amazon Web Services account.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The language code used to create your custom vocabulary. Each
                 vocabulary must contain terms in only one language.

                 A  custom  vocabulary can only be used to transcribe files in
                 the same language as the vocabulary. For example, if you cre-
                 ate  a vocabulary using US English (en-US ), you can only ap-
                 ply this vocabulary to files that contain English audio.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the specified vocabulary was last modified.

                 Timestamps are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC
                 .  For  example,  2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00 represents
                 12:32 PM UTC-7 on May 4, 2022.

              VocabularyState -> (string)
                 The processing state of your custom vocabulary. If the  state
                 is  READY  ,  you can use the vocabulary in a StartTranscrip-
                 tionJob request.
