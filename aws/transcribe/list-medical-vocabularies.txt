OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          If your ListMedicalVocabularies request returns  more  results  than
          can be displayed, NextToken is displayed in the response with an as-
          sociated string. To get the next page of results, copy  this  string
          and  repeat  your request, including NextToken with the value of the
          copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of custom medical vocabularies to return in  each
          page  of results. If there are fewer results than the value that you
          specify, only the actual results are returned. If you don't  specify
          a value, a default of 5 is used.

       --state-equals (string)
          Returns  only  custom medical vocabularies with the specified state.
          Custom vocabularies are ordered by creation date,  with  the  newest
          vocabulary first. If you don't include StateEquals , all custom med-
          ical vocabularies are returned.

          Possible values:

          o PENDING

          o READY

          o FAILED

       --name-contains (string)
          Returns only the custom medical vocabularies that contain the speci-
          fied string. The search is not case sensitive.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list your medical custom vocabularies

       The  following list-medical-vocabularies example lists the medical cus-
       tom vocabularies associated with your AWS account and  Region.  To  get
       more  information  about a particular transcription job, copy the value
       of a MedicalTranscriptionJobName parameter in the transcription output,
       and  specify  that  value for the MedicalTranscriptionJobName option of
       the get-medical-transcription-job command. To see more  of  your  tran-
       scription  jobs,  copy  the  value  of the NextToken parameter, run the
       list-medical-transcription-jobs command again, and specify  that  value
       in the --next-token option.

          aws transcribe list-medical-vocabularies

       Output:

OUTPUT
       Status -> (string)
          Lists all custom medical vocabularies that have the status specified
          in  your  request. Custom vocabularies are ordered by creation date,
          with the newest vocabulary first.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If NextToken is present in your response, it indicates that not  all
          results  are  displayed.  To  view the next set of results, copy the
          string associated with the NextToken parameter in your results  out-
          put,  then run your request again including NextToken with the value
          of the copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

       Vocabularies -> (list)
          Provides information about  the  custom  medical  vocabularies  that
          match the criteria specified in your request.

          (structure)
              Provides  information  about  a custom vocabulary, including the
              language of the custom vocabulary, when it  was  last  modified,
              its name, and the processing state.

              VocabularyName -> (string)
                 A  unique  name,  chosen  by you, for your custom vocabulary.
                 This name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and  must
                 be unique within an Amazon Web Services account.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The language code used to create your custom vocabulary. Each
                 custom vocabulary must contain terms in only one language.

                 A custom vocabulary can only be used to transcribe  files  in
                 the  same  language as the custom vocabulary. For example, if
                 you create a custom vocabulary using US English (en-US ), you
                 can  only  apply this custom vocabulary to files that contain
                 English audio.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the specified custom  vocabulary  was  last
                 modified.

                 Timestamps are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC
                 . For  example,  2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00  represents
                 12:32 PM UTC-7 on May 4, 2022.

              VocabularyState -> (string)
                 The  processing state of your custom vocabulary. If the state
                 is READY , you can use the custom vocabulary in a  StartTran-
                 scriptionJob request.
