NAME
       get-call-analytics-category -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides information about the specified Call Analytics category.

       To get a list of your Call Analytics categories, use the operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-call-analytics-category
          --category-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --category-name (string)
          The  name of the Call Analytics category you want information about.
          Category names are case sensitive.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CategoryProperties -> (structure)
          Provides  you with the properties of the Call Analytics category you
          specified in your GetCallAnalyticsCategory request.

          CategoryName -> (string)
              The name of the Call Analytics category. Category names are case
              sensitive  and  must be unique within an Amazon Web Services ac-
              count.

          Rules -> (list)
              The rules used to define a Call Analytics category.  Each  cate-
              gory can have between 1 and 20 rules.

              (structure)
                 A rule is a set of criteria you can specify to flag an attri-
                 bute in your Call Analytics output. Rules define a Call  Ana-
                 lytics category.

                 Rules can include these parameters: , , , and . To learn more
                 about these parameters, refer to Rule criteria .
