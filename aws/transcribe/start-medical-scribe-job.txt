NAME
       start-medical-scribe-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Transcribes  patient-clinician  conversations  and  generates  clinical
       notes.

       Amazon Web Services HealthScribe automatically provides rich  conversa-
       tion  transcripts,  identifies speaker roles, classifies dialogues, ex-
       tracts medical terms, and  generates  preliminary  clinical  notes.  To
       learn  more  about these features, refer to Amazon Web Services Health-
       Scribe .

       To make a StartMedicalScribeJob request, you must first upload your me-
       dia  file  into an Amazon S3 bucket; you can then specify the Amazon S3
       location of the file using the Media parameter.

       You must include the following  parameters  in  your  StartMedicalTran-
       scriptionJob request:

       o DataAccessRoleArn  :  The  ARN  of an IAM role with the these minimum
         permissions: read permission on input file Amazon S3 bucket specified
         in Media , write permission on the Amazon S3 bucket specified in Out-
         putBucketName , and full permissions on the KMS key specified in Out-
         putEncryptionKMSKeyId  (if  set).  The  role  should also allow tran-
         scribe.amazonaws.com to assume it.

       o Media (MediaFileUri ): The Amazon S3 location of your media file.

       o MedicalScribeJobName : A  custom  name  you  create  for  your  Medi-
         calScribe job that is unique within your Amazon Web Services account.

       o OutputBucketName  :  The  Amazon S3 bucket where you want your output
         files stored.

       o Settings : A MedicalScribeSettings obect that must set exactly one of
         ShowSpeakerLabels or ChannelIdentification to true. If ShowSpeakerLa-
         bels is true, MaxSpeakerLabels must also be set.

       o ChannelDefinitions : A MedicalScribeChannelDefinitions  array  should
         be  set if and only if the ChannelIdentification value of Settings is
         set to true.

OPTIONS
       --medical-scribe-job-name (string)
          A unique name, chosen by you, for your Medical Scribe job.

          This name is case sensitive, cannot  contain  spaces,  and  must  be
          unique within an Amazon Web Services account. If you try to create a
          new job with the same name as an existing job, you get a ConflictEx-
          ception error.

       --media (structure)
          Describes  the  Amazon S3 location of the media file you want to use
          in your request.

          For information on supported media formats, refer to the MediaFormat
          parameter  or  the  Media formats section in the Amazon S3 Developer
          Guide.

          MediaFileUri -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 location of the media file you want to transcribe.
              For example:

              o s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-media-file.flac

              o s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/media-files/my-media-file.flac

              Note  that  the  Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input media
              must be located in the same Amazon  Web  Services  Region  where
              you're making your transcription request.

          RedactedMediaFileUri -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 location of the media file you want to redact. For
              example:

              o s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-media-file.flac

              o s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/media-files/my-media-file.flac

              Note that the Amazon S3 bucket that contains  your  input  media
              must  be  located  in  the same Amazon Web Services Region where
              you're making your transcription request.

              WARNING:
                 RedactedMediaFileUri produces a redacted audio file in  addi-
                 tion  to a redacted transcript. It is only supported for Call
                 Analytics (StartCallAnalyticsJob ) transcription requests.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MediaFileUri=string,RedactedMediaFileUri=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MediaFileUri": "string",
            "RedactedMediaFileUri": "string"
          }

       --output-bucket-name (string)
          The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where you want your Medical  Scribe
          output  stored.  Do  not  include  the S3:// prefix of the specified
          bucket.

          Note that the role specified in the DataAccessRoleArn request param-
          eter  must  have  permission  to use the specified location. You can
          change Amazon S3 permissions using the Amazon Web  Services  Manage-
          ment Console . See also Permissions Required for IAM User Roles .

       --output-encryption-kms-key-id (string)
          The KMS key you want to use to encrypt your Medical Scribe output.

          If  using  a key located in the current Amazon Web Services account,
          you can specify your KMS key in one of four ways:

          o Use    the     KMS     key     ID     itself.     For     example,
            1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab .

          o Use an alias for the KMS key ID. For example, alias/ExampleAlias .

          o Use  the  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS key ID. For exam-
            ple,                                        arn:aws:kms:region:ac-
            count-ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab .

          o Use  the  ARN  for the KMS key alias. For example, arn:aws:kms:re-
            gion:account-ID:alias/ExampleAlias .

          If using a key located in a different Amazon  Web  Services  account
          than  the  current Amazon Web Services account, you can specify your
          KMS key in one of two ways:

          o Use the ARN for the  KMS  key  ID.  For  example,  arn:aws:kms:re-
            gion:account-ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab .

          o Use  the  ARN  for the KMS key alias. For example, arn:aws:kms:re-
            gion:account-ID:alias/ExampleAlias .

          If you do not specify an encryption key, your  output  is  encrypted
          with the default Amazon S3 key (SSE-S3).

          Note that the role specified in the DataAccessRoleArn request param-
          eter must have permission to use the specified KMS key.

       --kms-encryption-context (map)
          A map of plain text, non-secret key:value pairs, known as encryption
          context  pairs,  that  provide  an  added layer of security for your
          data.  For  more  information,  see  KMS  encryption   context   and
          Asymmetric keys in KMS .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --data-access-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that has permissions
          to access the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input files, write
          to  the output bucket, and use your KMS key if supplied. If the role
          that you specify doesnt have the appropriate  permissions  your  re-
          quest fails.

          IAM    role    ARNs    have    the   format   arn:partition:iam::ac-
          count:role/role-name-with-path        .         For         example:
          arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Admin .

          For more information, see IAM ARNs .

       --settings (structure)
          Makes  it  possible  to  control how your Medical Scribe job is pro-
          cessed using a MedicalScribeSettings object. Specify  ChannelIdenti-
          fication if ChannelDefinitions are set. Enabled ShowSpeakerLabels if
          ChannelIdentification and ChannelDefinitions are not  set.  One  and
          only one of ChannelIdentification and ShowSpeakerLabels must be set.
          If ShowSpeakerLabels is set, MaxSpeakerLabels must also be set.  Use
          Settings  to specify a vocabulary or vocabulary filter or both using
          VocabularyName , VocabularyFilterName . VocabularyFilterMethod  must
          be specified if VocabularyFilterName is set.

          ShowSpeakerLabels -> (boolean)
              Enables  speaker  partitioning  (diarization)  in  your  Medical
              Scribe output. Speaker partitioning labels the speech from indi-
              vidual speakers in your media file.

              If  you  enable ShowSpeakerLabels in your request, you must also
              include MaxSpeakerLabels .

              For more information, see Partitioning speakers (diarization) .

          MaxSpeakerLabels -> (integer)
              Specify the maximum number of speakers you want to partition  in
              your media.

              Note  that  if your media contains more speakers than the speci-
              fied number, multiple speakers are treated as a single speaker.

              If you specify the MaxSpeakerLabels  field,  you  must  set  the
              ShowSpeakerLabels field to true.

          ChannelIdentification -> (boolean)
              Enables channel identification in multi-channel audio.

              Channel identification transcribes the audio on each channel in-
              dependently, then appends the output for each channel  into  one
              transcript.

              For more information, see Transcribing multi-channel audio .

          VocabularyName -> (string)
              The  name  of  the custom vocabulary you want to include in your
              Medical Scribe request. Custom vocabulary names are case  sensi-
              tive.

          VocabularyFilterName -> (string)
              The  name of the custom vocabulary filter you want to include in
              your Medical Scribe request. Custom vocabulary filter names  are
              case sensitive.

              Note  that  if you include VocabularyFilterName in your request,
              you must also include VocabularyFilterMethod .

          VocabularyFilterMethod -> (string)
              Specify how you want your custom vocabulary  filter  applied  to
              your transcript.

              To replace words with *** , choose mask .

              To delete words, choose remove .

              To flag words without changing them, choose tag .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ShowSpeakerLabels=boolean,MaxSpeakerLabels=integer,ChannelIdentification=boolean,VocabularyName=string,VocabularyFilterName=string,VocabularyFilterMethod=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ShowSpeakerLabels": true|false,
            "MaxSpeakerLabels": integer,
            "ChannelIdentification": true|false,
            "VocabularyName": "string",
            "VocabularyFilterName": "string",
            "VocabularyFilterMethod": "remove"|"mask"|"tag"
          }

       --channel-definitions (list)
          Makes  it possible to specify which speaker is on which channel. For
          example, if the clinician is the first  participant  to  speak,  you
          would  set ChannelId of the first ChannelDefinition in the list to 0
          (to indicate the first channel) and ParticipantRole to CLINICIAN (to
          indicate  that  it's the clinician speaking). Then you would set the
          ChannelId of the second ChannelDefinition in the list to 1 (to indi-
          cate the second channel) and ParticipantRole to PATIENT (to indicate
          that it's the patient speaking).

          (structure)
              Indicates which speaker is on which  channel.  The  options  are
              CLINICIAN and PATIENT

              ChannelId -> (integer)
                 Specify the audio channel you want to define.

              ParticipantRole -> (string)
                 Specify  the  participant  that you want to flag. The options
                 are CLINICIAN and PATIENT

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ChannelId=integer,ParticipantRole=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ChannelId": integer,
              "ParticipantRole": "PATIENT"|"CLINICIAN"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --tags (list)
          Adds one or more custom tags, each in the form of a key:value  pair,
          to the Medica Scribe job.

          To  learn  more  about  using  tags with Amazon Transcribe, refer to
          Tagging resources .

          (structure)
              Adds metadata, in the form of a key:value pair, to the specified
              resource.

              For  example,  you  could  add the tag Department:Sales to a re-
              source to indicate that it pertains to your organization's sales
              department. You can also use tags for tag-based access control.

              To learn more about tagging, see Tagging resources .

              Key -> (string)
                 The  first  part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For example, in the  tag  Depart-
                 ment:Sales , the key is 'Department'.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For example, in the  tag  Depart-
                 ment:Sales , the value is 'Sales'.

                 Note  that you can set the value of a tag to an empty string,
                 but you can't set the value of a tag to  null.  Omitting  the
                 tag value is the same as using an empty string.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

          FailureReason -> (string)
              If MedicalScribeJobStatus is FAILED , FailureReason contains in-
              formation about why the  transcription  job  failed.  See  also:
              Common Errors .

          Settings -> (structure)
              Makes it possible to control how your Medical Scribe job is pro-
              cessed using a MedicalScribeSettings object.  Specify  ChannelI-
              dentification  if ChannelDefinitions are set. Enabled ShowSpeak-
              erLabels if ChannelIdentification and ChannelDefinitions are not
              set.  One and only one of ChannelIdentification and ShowSpeaker-
              Labels must be set. If ShowSpeakerLabels is  set,  MaxSpeakerLa-
              bels  must  also be set. Use Settings to specify a vocabulary or
              vocabulary filter or both using VocabularyName ,  VocabularyFil-
              terName  .  VocabularyFilterMethod  must be specified if Vocabu-
              laryFilterName is set.

              ShowSpeakerLabels -> (boolean)
                 Enables speaker partitioning (diarization)  in  your  Medical
                 Scribe  output.  Speaker  partitioning labels the speech from
                 individual speakers in your media file.

                 If you enable ShowSpeakerLabels in  your  request,  you  must
                 also include MaxSpeakerLabels .

                 For more information, see Partitioning speakers (diarization)
                 .

              MaxSpeakerLabels -> (integer)
                 Specify the maximum number of speakers you want to  partition
                 in your media.

                 Note that if your media contains more speakers than the spec-
                 ified number, multiple  speakers  are  treated  as  a  single
                 speaker.

                 If  you  specify the MaxSpeakerLabels field, you must set the
                 ShowSpeakerLabels field to true.

              ChannelIdentification -> (boolean)
                 Enables channel identification in multi-channel audio.

                 Channel identification transcribes the audio on each  channel
                 independently,  then appends the output for each channel into
                 one transcript.

                 For more information, see Transcribing multi-channel audio .

              VocabularyName -> (string)
                 The name of the custom vocabulary you want to include in your
                 Medical Scribe request. Custom vocabulary names are case sen-
                 sitive.

              VocabularyFilterName -> (string)
                 The name of the custom vocabulary filter you want to  include
                 in  your  Medical  Scribe  request.  Custom vocabulary filter
                 names are case sensitive.

                 Note that if you include  VocabularyFilterName  in  your  re-
                 quest, you must also include VocabularyFilterMethod .

              VocabularyFilterMethod -> (string)
                 Specify how you want your custom vocabulary filter applied to
                 your transcript.

                 To replace words with *** , choose mask .

                 To delete words, choose remove .

                 To flag words without changing them, choose tag .

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that  has  permis-
              sions  to  access  the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input
              files, write to the output bucket, and use your KMS key if  sup-
              plied.  If the role that you specify doesnt have the appropriate
              permissions your request fails.

              IAM   role   ARNs   have   the   format   arn:partition:iam::ac-
              count:role/role-name-with-path        .       For       example:
              arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Admin .

              For more information, see IAM ARNs .

          ChannelDefinitions -> (list)
              Makes it possible to specify which speaker is on which  channel.
              For example, if the clinician is the first participant to speak,
              you would set ChannelId of the first  ChannelDefinition  in  the
              list to 0 (to indicate the first channel) and ParticipantRole to
              CLINICIAN (to indicate that it's the clinician  speaking).  Then
              you  would  set the ChannelId of the second ChannelDefinition in
              the list to 1 (to indicate the second channel) and  Participant-
              Role to PATIENT (to indicate that it's the patient speaking).

              (structure)
                 Indicates  which speaker is on which channel. The options are
                 CLINICIAN and PATIENT

                 ChannelId -> (integer)
                     Specify the audio channel you want to define.

                 ParticipantRole -> (string)
                     Specify the participant that you want to  flag.  The  op-
                     tions are CLINICIAN and PATIENT

          Tags -> (list)
              Adds  one  or  more custom tags, each in the form of a key:value
              pair, to the Medica Scribe job.

              To learn more about using tags with Amazon Transcribe, refer  to
              Tagging resources .

              (structure)
                 Adds metadata, in the form of a key:value pair, to the speci-
                 fied resource.

                 For example, you could add the tag Department:Sales to a  re-
                 source  to  indicate  that it pertains to your organization's
                 sales department. You can also use tags for tag-based  access
                 control.

                 To learn more about tagging, see Tagging resources .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The first part of a key:value pair that forms a tag asso-
                     ciated with a given resource. For example, in the tag De-
                     partment:Sales , the key is 'Department'.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag as-
                     sociated with a given resource. For example, in  the  tag
                     Department:Sales , the value is 'Sales'.

                     Note  that  you  can  set  the value of a tag to an empty
                     string, but you can't set the value of  a  tag  to  null.
                     Omitting  the  tag  value  is  the same as using an empty
                     string.
