NAME
       create-vocabulary -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new custom vocabulary.

       When  creating  a  new medical vocabulary, you can either upload a text
       file that contains your new entries, phrases,  and  terms  into  an  S3
       bucket  or  include  a list of terms directly in your request using the
       Phrases flag.

       For more information on creating a custom vocabulary,  see  Creating  a
       custom vocabulary .

SYNOPSIS
            create-vocabulary
          --vocabulary-name <value>
          --language-code <value>
          [--phrases <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --vocabulary-name (string)
          The name of your new vocabulary.

          This  name  is  case  sensitive,  cannot contain spaces, and must be
          unique within an Amazon Web Services account. If you try to create a
          vocabulary  with  the  same name as a previous vocabulary, you get a
          ConflictException error.

       --language-code (string)
          The language code that represents the language  of  the  entries  in
          your  custom  vocabulary. Each vocabulary must contain terms in only
          one language. For a list of languages and their  corresponding  lan-
          guage codes, see Supported languages .

       --phrases (list)
          Use this flag to include a list of terms within your request.

          Note that if you include Phrases in your request, you cannot use Vo-
          cabularyFileUri ; you must choose one or the other.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --vocabulary-file-uri (string)
          The S3 location of the text file that contains your  custom  vocabu-
          lary. The URI must be located in the same region as the API endpoint
          you're calling.

          Here's an example URI path:
              https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-s3-bucket/my-vo-
              cab-file.txt

          Note that if you include VocabularyFileUri in your request, you can-
          not use the Phrases flag; you must choose one or the other.

       --tags (list)
          Adds one or more tags, each in the form of a key:value  pair,  to  a
          new custom vocabulary at the time you create this new vocabulary.

          (structure)
              A key:value pair that adds metadata to a resource used by Amazon
              Transcribe. For example, a tag with the key:value  pair  Depart-
              ment:Sales  might  be added to a resource to indicate its use by
              your organization's sales department.

              Key -> (string)
                 The first part of a key:value pair that forms a  tag  associ-
                 ated  with  a given resource. For example, in the tag Depart-
                 ment:Sales, the key is 'Department'.

              Value -> (string)
                 The second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag  associ-
                 ated  with  a given resource. For example, in the tag Depart-
                 ment:Sales, the value is 'Sales'.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a custom vocabulary

       The following create-vocabulary example creates a custom vocabulary. To
       create a custom vocabulary, you must have created a text file with  all
       the  terms  that  you  want  to transcribe more accurately. For vocabu-
       lary-file-uri, specify the Amazon Simple Storage  Service  (Amazon  S3)
       URI  of that text file. For language-code, specify a language code cor-
       responding to the language  of  your  custom  vocabulary.  For  vocabu-
       lary-name, specify what you want to call your custom vocabulary.

          aws transcribe create-vocabulary \
              --language-code language-code \
              --vocabulary-name cli-vocab-example \
              --vocabulary-file-uri s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/Amazon-S3-prefix/the-text-file-for-the-custom-vocabulary.txt

       Output:

          {
              "VocabularyName": "cli-vocab-example",
              "LanguageCode": "language-code",
              "VocabularyState": "PENDING"
          }

       For  more information, see Custom Vocabularies in the Amazon Transcribe
       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       VocabularyName -> (string)
          The name you chose for your vocabulary.

       LanguageCode -> (string)
          The language code you selected for your vocabulary.

       VocabularyState -> (string)
          The processing state of your vocabulary. If the state is READY , you
          can use the vocabulary in a StartTranscriptionJob request.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          The date and time you created your custom vocabulary.

       FailureReason -> (string)
          If  the VocabularyState field is FAILED , FailureReason contains in-
          formation about why the job failed.
