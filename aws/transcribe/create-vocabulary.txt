CREATE-VOCABULARY()                                        CREATE-VOCABULARY()



NAME
       create-vocabulary -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new custom vocabulary.

       When  creating  a  new  custom vocabulary, you can either upload a text
       file that contains your new entries, phrases, and terms into an  Amazon
       S3  bucket  and  include  the URI in your request. Or you can include a
       list of terms directly in your request using the Phrases flag.

       Each language has a character set that contains all allowed  characters
       for  that  specific  language.  If you use unsupported characters, your
       custom vocabulary request fails. Refer to Character Sets for Custom Vo-
       cabularies to get the character set for your language.

       For more information, see Custom vocabularies .

OPTIONS
       --vocabulary-name (string)
          A unique name, chosen by you, for your new custom vocabulary.

          This  name  is  case  sensitive,  cannot contain spaces, and must be
          unique within an Amazon Web Services account. If you try to create a
          new  custom  vocabulary with the same name as an existing custom vo-
          cabulary, you get a ConflictException error.

       --language-code (string)
          The language code that represents the language  of  the  entries  in
          your custom vocabulary. Each custom vocabulary must contain terms in
          only one language.

          A custom vocabulary can only be used to transcribe files in the same
          language as the custom vocabulary. For example, if you create a cus-
          tom vocabulary using US English (en-US ), you can  only  apply  this
          custom vocabulary to files that contain English audio.

          For  a  list  of  supported  languages and their associated language
          codes, refer to the Supported languages table.

       --phrases (list)
          Use this parameter if you want to create your custom  vocabulary  by
          including  all desired terms, as comma-separated values, within your
          request. The other option for creating your custom vocabulary is  to
          save  your  entries  in  a text file and upload them to an Amazon S3
          bucket, then specify the location of your file using the Vocabulary-
          FileUri parameter.

          Note that if you include Phrases in your request, you cannot use Vo-
          cabularyFileUri ; you must choose one or the other.

          Each language has a character set that contains all allowed  charac-
          ters  for that specific language. If you use unsupported characters,
          your custom vocabulary filter request fails. Refer to Character Sets
          for Custom Vocabularies to get the character set for your language.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --vocabulary-file-uri (string)
          The  Amazon  S3  location of the text file that contains your custom
          vocabulary. The URI must be located in the same Amazon Web  Services
          Region as the resource you're calling.

          Here's   an   example   URI   path:   s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-vo-
          cab-file.txt

          Note that if you include VocabularyFileUri in your request, you can-
          not use the Phrases flag; you must choose one or the other.

       --tags (list)
          Adds  one or more custom tags, each in the form of a key:value pair,
          to a new custom vocabulary at the time you create  this  new  custom
          vocabulary.

          To  learn  more  about  using  tags with Amazon Transcribe, refer to
          Tagging resources .

          (structure)
              Adds metadata, in the form of a key:value pair, to the specified
              resource.

              For  example,  you  could  add the tag Department:Sales to a re-
              source to indicate that it pertains to your organization's sales
              department. You can also use tags for tag-based access control.

              To learn more about tagging, see Tagging resources .

              Key -> (string)
                 The  first  part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For example, in the  tag  Depart-
                 ment:Sales , the key is 'Department'.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For example, in the  tag  Depart-
                 ment:Sales , the value is 'Sales'.

                 Note  that you can set the value of a tag to an empty string,
                 but you can't set the value of a tag to  null.  Omitting  the
                 tag value is the same as using an empty string.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a custom vocabulary

       The following create-vocabulary example creates a custom vocabulary. To
       create a custom vocabulary, you must have created a text file with  all
       the  terms  that  you  want  to transcribe more accurately. For vocabu-
       lary-file-uri, specify the Amazon Simple Storage  Service  (Amazon  S3)
       URI  of that text file. For language-code, specify a language code cor-
       responding to the language  of  your  custom  vocabulary.  For  vocabu-
       lary-name, specify what you want to call your custom vocabulary.

          aws transcribe create-vocabulary \
              --language-code language-code \
              --vocabulary-name cli-vocab-example \
              --vocabulary-file-uri s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/Amazon-S3-prefix/the-text-file-for-the-custom-vocabulary.txt

       Output:

          {
              "VocabularyName": "cli-vocab-example",
              "LanguageCode": "language-code",
              "VocabularyState": "PENDING"
          }

       For  more information, see Custom Vocabularies in the Amazon Transcribe
       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       VocabularyName -> (string)
          The name you chose for your custom vocabulary.

       LanguageCode -> (string)
          The language code you selected for your custom vocabulary.

       VocabularyState -> (string)
          The processing state of your custom  vocabulary.  If  the  state  is
          READY , you can use the custom vocabulary in a StartTranscriptionJob
          request.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          The date and time you created your custom vocabulary.

          Timestamps are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC .  For
          example,  2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00 represents 12:32 PM UTC-7
          on May 4, 2022.

       FailureReason -> (string)
          If VocabularyState is FAILED ,  FailureReason  contains  information
          about why the custom vocabulary request failed. See also: Common Er-
          rors .
