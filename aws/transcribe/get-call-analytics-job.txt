OPTIONS
       --call-analytics-job-name (string)
          The name of the Call Analytics job you want information  about.  Job
          names are case sensitive.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

OUTPUT
       CallAnalyticsJob -> (structure)
          Provides detailed information about  the  specified  Call  Analytics
          job, including job status and, if applicable, failure reason.

          CallAnalyticsJobName -> (string)
              The name of the Call Analytics job. Job names are case sensitive
              and must be unique within an Amazon Web Services account.

          CallAnalyticsJobStatus -> (string)
              Provides the status of the specified Call Analytics job.

              If the status is COMPLETED , the job is  finished  and  you  can
              find  the results at the location specified in TranscriptFileUri
              (or RedactedTranscriptFileUri  ,  if  you  requested  transcript
              redaction). If the status is FAILED , FailureReason provides de-
              tails on why your transcription job failed.

          LanguageCode -> (string)
              The language code used to create your Call Analytics job. For  a
              list of supported languages and their associated language codes,
              refer to the Supported languages table.

              If you do not know the language spoken in your media  file,  you
              can  omit  this  field  and  let Amazon Transcribe automatically
              identify the language of your media. To improve the accuracy  of
              language  identification, you can include several language codes
              and Amazon Transcribe chooses the closest match for  your  tran-
              scription.

          MediaSampleRateHertz -> (integer)
              The  sample rate, in hertz, of the audio track in your input me-
              dia file.

          MediaFormat -> (string)
              The format of the input media file.

          Media -> (structure)
              Provides the Amazon S3 location of the media file  you  used  in
              your Call Analytics request.

              MediaFileUri -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  S3  location of the media file you want to tran-
                 scribe. For example:

                 o s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-media-file.flac

                 o s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/media-files/my-media-file.flac

                 Note that the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input media
                 must  be located in the same Amazon Web Services Region where
                 you're making your transcription request.

              RedactedMediaFileUri -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 location of the media file you want to  redact.
                 For example:

                 o s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-media-file.flac

                 o s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/media-files/my-media-file.flac

                 Note that the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input media
                 must be located in the same Amazon Web Services Region  where
                 you're making your transcription request.

                 WARNING:
                     RedactedMediaFileUri  produces  a  redacted audio file in
                     addition to a redacted transcript. It is  only  supported
                     for Call Analytics (StartCallAnalyticsJob ) transcription
                     requests.

          Transcript -> (structure)
              Provides you with the Amazon S3 URI you can use to  access  your
              transcript.

              TranscriptFileUri -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  S3 location of your transcript. You can use this
                 URI to access or download your transcript.

                 If you included OutputBucketName in  your  transcription  job
                 request, this is the URI of that bucket. If you also included
                 OutputKey in your request, your output is located in the path
                 you specified in your request.

                 If  you didn't include OutputBucketName in your transcription
                 job request, your transcript is stored in  a  service-managed
                 bucket,  and  TranscriptFileUri provides you with a temporary
                 URI you can use for secure access to your transcript.

                 NOTE:
                     Temporary URIs for service-managed Amazon S3 buckets  are
                     only  valid for 15 minutes. If you get an AccesDenied er-
                     ror, you can get a new temporary URI by  running  a  Get-
                     TranscriptionJob or ListTranscriptionJob request.

              RedactedTranscriptFileUri -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  S3 location of your redacted transcript. You can
                 use this URI to access or download your transcript.

                 If you included OutputBucketName in  your  transcription  job
                 request, this is the URI of that bucket. If you also included
                 OutputKey in your request, your output is located in the path
                 you specified in your request.

                 If  you didn't include OutputBucketName in your transcription
                 job request, your transcript is stored in  a  service-managed
                 bucket,  and  RedactedTranscriptFileUri  provides  you with a
                 temporary URI you can use for secure  access  to  your  tran-
                 script.

                 NOTE:
                     Temporary  URIs for service-managed Amazon S3 buckets are
                     only valid for 15 minutes. If you get an AccesDenied  er-
                     ror,  you  can  get a new temporary URI by running a Get-
                     TranscriptionJob or ListTranscriptionJob request.

              scription  job  that started processing at 12:33 PM UTC-7 on May
              4, 2022.

          FailureReason -> (string)
              If CallAnalyticsJobStatus is FAILED , FailureReason contains in-
              formation about why the Call Analytics job request failed.

              The FailureReason field contains one of the following values:

              o Unsupported media format . The media format specified in Medi-
                aFormat isn't valid. Refer to refer to the MediaFormat parame-
                ter for a list of supported formats.

              o The  media  format  provided does not match the detected media
                format . The media format  specified  in  MediaFormat  doesn't
                match  the format of the input file. Check the media format of
                your media file and correct the specified value.

              o Invalid sample rate for audio file . The sample rate specified
                in  MediaSampleRateHertz  isn't valid. The sample rate must be
                between 8,000 and 48,000 hertz.

              o The sample rate provided does not match  the  detected  sample
                rate  .  The  sample  rate  specified  in MediaSampleRateHertz
                doesn't match the sample rate detected  in  your  input  media
                file. Check the sample rate of your media file and correct the
                specified value.

              o Invalid file size: file size too large . The size of your  me-
                dia  file  is  larger than what Amazon Transcribe can process.
                For more information, refer to Service quotas .

              o Invalid number of channels: number of  channels  too  large  .
                Your  audio  contains  more channels than Amazon Transcribe is
                able to process. For more information, refer to Service quotas
                .

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) you included in your request.

          IdentifiedLanguageScore -> (float)
              The  confidence score associated with the language identified in
              your media file.

              Confidence scores are values between 0 and 1; a larger value in-
              dicates  a  higher probability that the identified language cor-
              rectly matches the language spoken in your media.

          Settings -> (structure)
              Provides information on any additional settings  that  were  in-
              cluded  in  your  request.  Additional  settings include content
              redaction and language identification settings.

              VocabularyName -> (string)
                 The name of the custom vocabulary you want to include in your
                 Call Analytics transcription request. Custom vocabulary names
                 are case sensitive.

              VocabularyFilterName -> (string)
                 The name of the custom vocabulary filter you want to  include
                 in  your Call Analytics transcription request. Custom vocabu-
                 lary filter names are case sensitive.

                 Note that if you include  VocabularyFilterName  in  your  re-
                 quest, you must also include VocabularyFilterMethod .

              VocabularyFilterMethod -> (string)
                 Specify how you want your custom vocabulary filter applied to
                 your transcript.

                 To replace words with *** , choose mask .

                 To delete words, choose remove .

                 To flag words without changing them, choose tag .

              LanguageModelName -> (string)
                 The name of the custom language model you want  to  use  when
                 processing your Call Analytics job. Note that custom language
                 model names are case sensitive.

                 The language of the  specified  custom  language  model  must
                 match  the  language code that you specify in your transcrip-
                 tion request. If the languages do not match, the custom  lan-
                 guage  model  isn't  applied. There are no errors or warnings
                 associated with a language mismatch.

              ContentRedaction -> (structure)
                 Makes it possible to  redact  or  flag  specified  personally
                 identifiable information (PII) in your transcript. If you use
                 ContentRedaction , you must also include the  sub-parameters:
                 RedactionOutput  and  RedactionType  . You can optionally in-
                 clude PiiEntityTypes to choose which types of PII you want to
                 redact.

                 RedactionType -> (string)
                     Specify  the  category of information you want to redact;
                     PII (personally identifiable  information)  is  the  only
                     valid  value.  You can use PiiEntityTypes to choose which
                     types of PII you want to redact. If you  do  not  include
                     PiiEntityTypes in your request, all PII is redacted.

                 RedactionOutput -> (string)
                     Specify if you want only a redacted transcript, or if you
                     want a redacted and an unredacted transcript.

                     When you choose redacted Amazon Transcribe creates only a
                     redacted transcript.

                     When you choose redacted_and_unredacted Amazon Transcribe
                     creates a redacted and an unredacted transcript  (as  two
                     separate files).

                 PiiEntityTypes -> (list)
                     Specify  which  types of personally identifiable informa-
                     tion (PII) you want to redact in your transcript. You can
                     include  as  many  types as you'd like, or you can select
                     ALL . If you do not include PiiEntityTypes  in  your  re-
                     quest, all PII is redacted.

                     (string)

              LanguageOptions -> (list)
                 You can specify two or more language codes that represent the
                 languages you think may be present in your  media.  Including
                 more than five is not recommended. If you're unsure what lan-
                 guages are present, do not include this parameter.

                 Including language options can improve the accuracy  of  lan-
                 guage identification.

                 For  a list of languages supported with Call Analytics, refer
                 to the Supported languages table.

                 To transcribe speech in Modern Standard Arabic (ar-SA ), your
                 media  file  must be encoded at a sample rate of 16,000 Hz or
                 higher.

                 (string)

              LanguageIdSettings -> (map)
                 If using automatic language identification  in  your  request
                 and  you  want to apply a custom language model, a custom vo-
                 cabulary, or a custom vocabulary filter, include  LanguageId-
                 Settings  with  the relevant sub-parameters (VocabularyName ,
                 LanguageModelName , and VocabularyFilterName ).
                     LanguageIdSettings supports two to five  language  codes.
                     Each  language  code  you  include can have an associated
                     custom language model, custom vocabulary, and custom  vo-
                     cabulary filter. The language codes that you specify must
                     match the languages of  the  associated  custom  language
                     models,  custom  vocabularies, and custom vocabulary fil-
                     ters.

                 It's recommended that you include LanguageOptions when  using
                 LanguageIdSettings  to  ensure  that the correct language di-
                 alect is identified. For example, if you specify a custom vo-
                 cabulary  that  is  in en-US but Amazon Transcribe determines
                 that the language spoken in your media is en-AU , your custom
                 vocabulary  is  not applied to your transcription. If you in-
                 clude LanguageOptions and include en-US as the  only  English
                 language  dialect,  your custom vocabulary is applied to your
                 transcription.

                 If you want to include a custom language model, custom vocab-
                 ulary,  or  custom vocabulary filter with your request but do
                 not want to use automatic language  identification,  use  in-
                 stead  the parameter with the LanguageModelName , Vocabulary-
                 Name , or VocabularyFilterName sub-parameters.

                 For a list of languages supported with Call Analytics,  refer
                 to Supported languages and language-specific features .

                 value -> (structure)
                     If  using  automatic  language identification in your re-
                     quest and you want to apply a custom  language  model,  a
                     custom vocabulary, or a custom vocabulary filter, include
                     LanguageIdSettings with the relevant sub-parameters  (Vo-
                     cabularyName  , LanguageModelName , and VocabularyFilter-
                     Name ). Note that multi-language identification  (Identi-
                     fyMultipleLanguages  )  doesn't  support  custom language
                     models.
                        LanguageIdSettings  supports  two  to  five   language
                        codes.  Each language code you include can have an as-
                        sociated custom language model, custom vocabulary, and
                        custom  vocabulary filter. The language codes that you
                        specify must match the  languages  of  the  associated
                        custom  language models, custom vocabularies, and cus-
                        tom vocabulary filters.

                     It's recommended that you  include  LanguageOptions  when
                     using  LanguageIdSettings to ensure that the correct lan-
                     guage dialect is identified. For example, if you  specify
                     a  custom  vocabulary  that  is in en-US but Amazon Tran-
                     scribe determines that the language spoken in your  media
                     is  en-AU , your custom vocabulary is not applied to your
                     transcription. If you include LanguageOptions and include
                     en-US  as  the only English language dialect, your custom
                     vocabulary is applied to your transcription.

                     If you want to include a custom language model with  your
                     request but do not want to use automatic language identi-
                     fication, use instead the parameter with the LanguageMod-
                     elName sub-parameter. If you want to include a custom vo-
                     cabulary or a custom vocabulary  filter  (or  both)  with
                     your  request  but  do not want to use automatic language
                     identification, use instead the parameter with the Vocab-
                     ularyName  or  VocabularyFilterName (or both) sub-parame-
                     ter.

                     VocabularyName -> (string)
                        The name of the custom vocabulary you want to use when
                        processing  your  transcription job. Custom vocabulary
                        names are case sensitive.

                        The language of the specified custom  vocabulary  must
                        match the language code that you specify in your tran-
                        scription request. If the languages do not match,  the
                        custom  vocabulary  isn't applied. There are no errors
                        or warnings associated with a language mismatch.

                     VocabularyFilterName -> (string)
                        The name of the custom vocabulary filter you  want  to
                        use when processing your transcription job. Custom vo-
                        cabulary filter names are case sensitive.

                        The language of the specified custom vocabulary filter
                        must  match the language code that you specify in your
                        transcription request. If the languages do not  match,
                        the  custom vocabulary filter isn't applied. There are
                        no errors or warnings associated with a language  mis-
                        match.

                        Note  that if you include VocabularyFilterName in your
                        request, you must also include  VocabularyFilterMethod
                        .

                     LanguageModelName -> (string)
                        The  name of the custom language model you want to use
                        when processing your transcription job. Note that cus-
                        tom language model names are case sensitive.

                        The  language  of  the specified custom language model
                        must match the language code that you specify in  your
                        transcription  request. If the languages do not match,
                        the custom language model isn't applied. There are  no
                        errors  or  warnings  associated  with a language mis-
                        match.

              Summarization -> (structure)
                 Contains GenerateAbstractiveSummary , which is a required pa-
                 rameter  if  you want to enable Generative call summarization
                 in your Call Analytics request.

                 GenerateAbstractiveSummary -> (boolean)
                     Enables Generative call summarization in your  Call  Ana-
                     lytics request

                     Generative  call  summarization provides a summary of the
                     transcript including important  components  discussed  in
                     the conversation.

                     For more information, see Enabling generative call summa-
                     rization .

          ChannelDefinitions -> (list)
              Indicates which speaker is on which channel.

              (structure)
                 Makes it possible to specify which speaker is on which  chan-
                 nel.  For  example, if your agent is the first participant to
                 speak, you would set ChannelId to 0 (to  indicate  the  first
                 channel)  and ParticipantRole to AGENT (to indicate that it's
                 the agent speaking).

                 ChannelId -> (integer)
                     Specify the audio channel you want to define.

                 ParticipantRole -> (string)
                     Specify the speaker you want to define. Omitting this pa-
                     rameter is equivalent to specifying both participants.
