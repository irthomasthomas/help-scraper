       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-call-analytics-job
          --call-analytics-job-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --call-analytics-job-name (string)
          The name of the Call Analytics job you want information  about.  Job
          names are case sensitive.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CallAnalyticsJob -> (structure)
          Provides detailed information about  the  specified  Call  Analytics
          job, including job status and, if applicable, failure reason.

          CallAnalyticsJobName -> (string)
              The name of the Call Analytics job. Job names are case sensitive
              and must be unique within an Amazon Web Services account.

          CallAnalyticsJobStatus -> (string)
              Provides the status of the specified Call Analytics job.

              If the status is COMPLETED , the job is  finished  and  you  can
              find  the results at the location specified in TranscriptFileUri
              (or RedactedTranscriptFileUri  ,  if  you  requested  transcript
              redaction). If the status is FAILED , FailureReason provides de-
              tails on why your transcription job failed.

          LanguageCode -> (string)
              The language code used to create your Call Analytics job. For  a
              list of supported languages and their associated language codes,
              refer to the Supported languages table.

              If you don't know the language spoken in your  media  file,  you
              can  omit  this  field  and  let Amazon Transcribe automatically
              identify the language of your media. To improve the accuracy  of
              language  identification, you can include several language codes
              and Amazon Transcribe chooses the closest match for  your  tran-
              scription.

          MediaSampleRateHertz -> (integer)
              The  sample rate, in Hertz, of the audio track in your input me-
              dia file.

          MediaFormat -> (string)
              The format of the input media file.

          Media -> (structure)
              Describes the Amazon S3 location of the media file you  want  to
              use in your request.

              MediaFileUri -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  S3  location of the media file you want to tran-
                 scribe. For example:

                 o s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-media-file.flac

                 o s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/media-files/my-media-file.flac

                 Note that the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input media
                 must  be located in the same Amazon Web Services Region where
                 you're making your transcription request.

              RedactedMediaFileUri -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 location of the media file you want to  redact.
                 For example:

                 o s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-media-file.flac

                 o s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/media-files/my-media-file.flac

                 Note that the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input media
                 must be located in the same Amazon Web Services Region  where
                 you're making your transcription request.

                 WARNING:
                     RedactedMediaFileUri is only supported for Call Analytics
                     (StartCallAnalyticsJob ) transcription requests.

          Transcript -> (structure)
              Provides you with the Amazon S3 URI you can use to  access  your
              transcript.

              TranscriptFileUri -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  S3 location of your transcript. You can use this
                 URI to access or download your transcript.

                 If you included OutputBucketName in  your  transcription  job
                 request, this is the URI of that bucket. If you also included
                 OutputKey in your request, your output is located in the path
                 you specified in your request.

                 If  you didn't include OutputBucketName in your transcription
                 job request, your transcript is stored in  a  service-managed
                 bucket,  and  TranscriptFileUri provides you with a temporary
                 URI you can use for secure access to your transcript.

                 NOTE:
                     Temporary URIs for service-managed Amazon S3 buckets  are
                     only  valid for 15 minutes. If you get an AccesDenied er-
                     ror, you can get a new temporary URI by  running  a  Get-
                     TranscriptionJob or ListTranscriptionJob request.

              RedactedTranscriptFileUri -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  S3 location of your redacted transcript. You can
                 use this URI to access or download your transcript.

                 If you included OutputBucketName in  your  transcription  job
                 request, this is the URI of that bucket. If you also included
                 OutputKey in your request, your output is located in the path
                 you specified in your request.

                 If  you didn't include OutputBucketName in your transcription
                 job request, your transcript is stored in  a  service-managed
                 bucket,  and  RedactedTranscriptFileUri  provides  you with a
                 temporary URI you can use for secure  access  to  your  tran-
                 script.

                 NOTE:
                     Temporary  URIs for service-managed Amazon S3 buckets are
                     only valid for 15 minutes. If you get an AccesDenied  er-
                     ror,  you  can  get a new temporary URI by running a Get-
                     TranscriptionJob or ListTranscriptionJob request.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time the specified Call Analytics  job  began  pro-
              cessing.

              Timestamps  are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC .
              For example, 2022-05-04T12:32:58.789000-07:00 represents a tran-
              scription  job  that started processing at 12:32 PM UTC-7 on May
              4, 2022.

          CompletionTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time the specified Call Analytics job finished pro-
              cessing.

              Timestamps  are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC .
              For example, 2022-05-04T12:33:13.922000-07:00 represents a tran-
              scription  job  that started processing at 12:33 PM UTC-7 on May
              4, 2022.

          FailureReason -> (string)
              If CallAnalyticsJobStatus is FAILED , FailureReason contains in-
              formation about why the Call Analytics job request failed.

              The FailureReason field contains one of the following values:

              o Unsupported media format . The media format specified in Medi-
                aFormat isn't valid. Refer to MediaFormat for a list  of  sup-
                ported formats.

              o The  media  format  provided does not match the detected media
                format . The media format  specified  in  MediaFormat  doesn't
                match  the format of the input file. Check the media format of
                your media file and correct the specified value.

              o Invalid sample rate for audio file . The sample rate specified
                in  MediaSampleRateHertz  isn't valid. The sample rate must be
                between 8,000 and 48,000 Hertz.

              o The sample rate provided does not match  the  detected  sample
                rate  .  The  sample  rate  specified  in MediaSampleRateHertz
                doesn't match the sample rate detected  in  your  input  media
                file. Check the sample rate of your media file and correct the
                specified value.

              o Invalid file size: file size too large . The size of your  me-
                dia  file  is  larger than what Amazon Transcribe can process.
                For more information, refer to Guidelines and quotas .

              o Invalid number of channels: number of  channels  too  large  .
                Your  audio  contains  more channels than Amazon Transcribe is
                able to process. For more information, refer to Guidelines and
                quotas .

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that has permis-
              sions to access the Amazon S3 bucket that  contains  your  input
              files.  If the role you specify doesnt have the appropriate per-
              missions to access the specified Amazon S3  location,  your  re-
              quest fails.

              IAM   role   ARNs   have   the   format   arn:partition:iam::ac-
              count:role/role-name-with-path       .       For        example:
              arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Admin .

              For more information, see IAM ARNs .

          IdentifiedLanguageScore -> (float)
              The  confidence score associated with the language identified in
              your media file.

              Confidence scores are values between 0 and 1; a larger value in-
              dicates  a  higher probability that the identified language cor-
              rectly matches the language spoken in your media.

          Settings -> (structure)
              Allows additional optional settings in your  request,  including
              content  redaction;  allows you to apply custom language models,
              vocabulary filters, and custom vocabularies to your Call Analyt-
              ics job.

              VocabularyName -> (string)
                 The name of the custom vocabulary you want to include in your
                 Call Analytics transcription request.  Vocabulary  names  are
                 case sensitive.

              VocabularyFilterName -> (string)
                 The  name of the custom vocabulary filter you want to include
                 in your Call Analytics transcription request. Vocabulary fil-
                 ter names are case sensitive.

                 Note  that  if  you  include VocabularyFilterName in your re-
                 quest, you must also include VocabularyFilterMethod .

              VocabularyFilterMethod -> (string)
                 Specify how you want your vocabulary filter applied  to  your
                 transcript.

                 To replace words with *** , choose mask .

                 To delete words, choose remove .

                 To flag words without changing them, choose tag .

              LanguageModelName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the custom language model you want to use when
                 processing your Call Analytics job. Note that language  model
                 names are case sensitive.

                 The  language  of the specified language model must match the
                 language code you specify in your transcription  request.  If
                 the  languages don't match, the language model isn't applied.
                 There are no errors or warnings associated  with  a  language
                 mismatch.

              ContentRedaction -> (structure)
                 Allows  you  to redact or flag specified personally identifi-
                 able information (PII) in your transcript. If  you  use  Con-
                 tentRedaction , you must also include the sub-parameters: Pi-
                 iEntityTypes , RedactionOutput , and RedactionType .

                 RedactionType -> (string)
                     Specify the category of information you want  to  redact;
                     PII  (personally  identifiable  information)  is the only
                     valid value. You can use PiiEntityTypes to  choose  which
                     types of PII you want to redact.

                 RedactionOutput -> (string)
                     Specify if you want only a redacted transcript, or if you
                     want a redacted and an unredacted transcript.

                     When you choose redacted Amazon Transcribe creates only a
                     redacted transcript.

                     When you choose redacted_and_unredacted Amazon Transcribe
                     creates a redacted and an unredacted transcript  (as  two
                     separate files).

                 PiiEntityTypes -> (list)
                     Specify  which  types of personally identifiable informa-
                     tion (PII) you want to redact in your transcript. You can
                     include  as  many  types as you'd like, or you can select
                     ALL .

                     (string)

              LanguageOptions -> (list)
                 You can specify two or more language codes that represent the
                 languages  you  think may be present in your media; including
                 more than five is not recommended. If you're unsure what lan-
                 guages are present, do not include this parameter.

                 Including  language  options can improve the accuracy of lan-
                 guage identification.

                 For a list of languages supported with Call Analytics,  refer
                 to the Supported languages table.

                 (string)

              LanguageIdSettings -> (map)
                 If  using automatic language identification (IdentifyLanguage
                 ) in your request and you want to  apply  a  custom  language
                 model,  a  custom  vocabulary, or a custom vocabulary filter,
                 include LanguageIdSettings with the  relevant  sub-parameters
                 (VocabularyName  ,  LanguageModelName , and VocabularyFilter-
                 Name ).

                 You can specify two or more language codes that represent the
                 languages  you  think may be present in your media; including
                 more than five is not recommended. Each language code you in-
                 clude  can  have  an associated custom language model, custom
                 vocabulary, and custom vocabulary filter. The  languages  you
                 specify must match the languages of the specified custom lan-
                 guage models, custom vocabularies, and custom vocabulary fil-
                 ters.

                 To  include  language options using IdentifyLanguage  without
                 including a custom language model, a custom vocabulary, or  a
                 custom vocabulary filter, use LanguageOptions instead of Lan-
                 guageIdSettings . Including language options can improve  the
                 accuracy of automatic language identification.

                 If  you want to include a custom language model with your re-
                 quest but do not want to use automatic  language  identifica-
                 tion,  use  instead  the parameter with the LanguageModelName
                 sub-parameter.

                 If you want to include a custom vocabulary or a custom vocab-
                 ulary  filter  (or both) with your request but do not want to
                 use automatic language identification, use instead the param-
                 eter  with  the  VocabularyName  or  VocabularyFilterName (or
                 both) sub-parameter.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     If using automatic language identification  (IdentifyLan-
                     guage  )  in  your request and you want to apply a custom
                     language model, a custom vocabulary, or a custom  vocabu-
                     lary filter, include LanguageIdSettings with the relevant
                     sub-parameters (VocabularyName , LanguageModelName ,  and
                     VocabularyFilterName ).

                     You can specify two or more language codes that represent
                     the languages you think may be present in your media; in-
                     cluding  more than five is not recommended. Each language
                     code you include can have an associated  custom  language
                     model,  custom  vocabulary, and custom vocabulary filter.
                     The languages you specify must match the languages of the
                     specified  custom  language  models, custom vocabularies,
                     and custom vocabulary filters.

                     To include language options using IdentifyLanguage  with-
                     out  including  a custom language model, a custom vocabu-
                     lary, or a custom vocabulary filter, use  LanguageOptions
                     instead  of  LanguageIdSettings  . Including language op-
                     tions can improve  the  accuracy  of  automatic  language
                     identification.

                     If  you want to include a custom language model with your
                     request but do not want to use automatic language identi-
                     fication, use instead the parameter with the LanguageMod-
                     elName sub-parameter.

                     If you want to include a custom vocabulary  or  a  custom
                     vocabulary  filter (or both) with your request but do not
                     want to use automatic language  identification,  use  in-
                     stead  the  parameter  with the VocabularyName or Vocabu-
                     laryFilterName (or both) sub-parameter.

                     VocabularyName -> (string)
                        The name of the custom vocabulary you want to use when
                        processing  your  transcription  job. Vocabulary names
                        are case sensitive.

                        The language of the specified  vocabulary  must  match
                        the  language  code  you specify in your transcription
                        request. If the languages don't match, the  vocabulary
                        isn't applied. There are no errors or warnings associ-
                        ated with a language mismatch.

                     VocabularyFilterName -> (string)
                        The name of the custom vocabulary filter you  want  to
                        use when processing your transcription job. Vocabulary
                        filter names are case sensitive.

                        The language of the specified vocabulary  filter  must
                        match the language code you specify in your transcrip-
                        tion request. If the languages don't match, the vocab-
                        ulary  filter  isn't  applied.  There are no errors or
                        warnings associated with a language mismatch.

                        Note that if you include VocabularyFilterName in  your
                        request,  you must also include VocabularyFilterMethod
                        .

                     LanguageModelName -> (string)
                        The name of the custom language model you want to  use
                        when processing your transcription job. Note that lan-
                        guage model names are case sensitive.

                        The language of  the  specified  language  model  must
                        match the language code you specify in your transcrip-
                        tion request. If the languages don't match,  the  lan-
                        guage  model  isn't  applied.  There  are no errors or
                        warnings associated with a language mismatch.

          ChannelDefinitions -> (list)
              Allows you to specify which speaker is on which channel in  your
              Call  Analytics  job  request. For example, if your agent is the
              first participant to speak, you would set ChannelId to 0 (to in-
              dicate the first channel) and ParticipantRole to AGENT (to indi-
              cate that it's the agent speaking).

              (structure)
                 Allows you to specify which speaker is on which channel.  For
                 example, if your agent is the first participant to speak, you
                 would set ChannelId to 0 (to indicate the first channel)  and
                 ParticipantRole  to  AGENT  (to  indicate that it's the agent
                 speaking).

                 ChannelId -> (integer)
                     Specify the audio channel you want to define.

                 ParticipantRole -> (string)
                     Specify the speaker you want to define. Omitting this pa-
                     rameter is equivalent to specifying both participants.
