NAME
       list-call-analytics-categories -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  a list of Call Analytics categories, including all rules that
       make up each category.

       To get detailed information about a specific Call  Analytics  category,
       use the operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-call-analytics-categories
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          If  your  ListCallAnalyticsCategories  request  returns more results
          than can be displayed, NextToken is displayed in the  response  with
          an  associated  string.  To  get the next page of results, copy this
          string and repeat your request, including NextToken with  the  value
          of the copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of Call Analytics categories to return in each
          page of results. If there are fewer results than the value you spec-
          ify,  only  the  actual results are returned. If you don't specify a
          value, a default of 5 is used.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If  NextToken is present in your response, it indicates that not all
          results are displayed. To view the next set  of  results,  copy  the
          string  associated with the NextToken parameter in your results out-
          put, then run your request again including NextToken with the  value
          of the copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

       Categories -> (list)
          Provides  detailed information about your Call Analytics categories,
          including all the rules associated with each category.

          (structure)
              Provides you with the properties of the Call Analytics  category
              you  specified  in your request. This includes the list of rules
              that define the specified category.

              CategoryName -> (string)
                 The name of the Call Analytics category. Category  names  are
                 case  sensitive  and must be unique within an Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices account.

              Rules -> (list)
                 The rules used to define a Call Analytics category. Each cat-
                 egory can have between 1 and 20 rules.

                 (structure)
                     A  rule  is  a set of criteria you can specify to flag an
                     attribute in your Call Analytics output. Rules  define  a
                     Call Analytics category.

                     Rules  can include these parameters: , , , and . To learn
                     more about these parameters, refer to Rule criteria .

                        Negate -> (boolean)
                            Set to TRUE to flag  periods  of  speech.  Set  to

                            example,  if your customer says "speak to the man-
                            ager", instead of "speak to a manager", your  con-
                            tent is not flagged.
