SYNOPSIS
            list-call-analytics-jobs
          [--status <value>]
          [--job-name-contains <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          Returns only Call Analytics jobs with the specified status. Jobs are
          ordered  by  creation  date, with the newest job first. If you don't
          include Status , all Call Analytics jobs are returned.

          Possible values:

          o QUEUED

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o FAILED

          o COMPLETED

       --job-name-contains (string)
          Returns only the Call Analytics  jobs  that  contain  the  specified
          string. The search is not case sensitive.

       --next-token (string)
          If  your ListCallAnalyticsJobs request returns more results than can
          be displayed, NextToken is displayed in the response with an associ-
          ated  string.  To get the next page of results, copy this string and
          repeat your request, including  NextToken  with  the  value  of  the
          copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of Call Analytics jobs to return in each page of
          results. If there are fewer results than the value you specify, only
          the actual results are returned. If you don't specify a value, a de-
          fault of 5 is used.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
