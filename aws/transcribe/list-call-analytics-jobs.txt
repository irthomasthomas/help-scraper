OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          Returns only Call Analytics jobs with the specified status. Jobs are
          ordered  by  creation date, with the newest job first. If you do not
          include Status , all Call Analytics jobs are returned.

          Possible values:

          o QUEUED

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o FAILED

          o COMPLETED

       --job-name-contains (string)
          Returns only the Call Analytics  jobs  that  contain  the  specified
          string. The search is not case sensitive.

       --next-token (string)
          If  your ListCallAnalyticsJobs request returns more results than can
          be displayed, NextToken is displayed in the response with an associ-
          ated  string.  To get the next page of results, copy this string and
          repeat your request, including  NextToken  with  the  value  of  the
          copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of Call Analytics jobs to return in each page of
          results. If there are fewer results than the value that you specify,
          only the actual results are returned. If you do not specify a value,
          a default of 5 is used.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.
