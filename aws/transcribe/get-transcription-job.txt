NAME
       get-transcription-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides information about the specified transcription job.

       To  view the status of the specified transcription job, check the Tran-
       scriptionJobStatus field. If the status is COMPLETED , the job is  fin-
       ished.  You  can  find  the  results at the location specified in Tran-
       scriptFileUri . If the status is FAILED ,  FailureReason  provides  de-
       tails on why your transcription job failed.

       If  you enabled content redaction, the redacted transcript can be found
       at the location specified in RedactedTranscriptFileUri .

OPTIONS
       --transcription-job-name (string)
          The name of the transcription job you want  information  about.  Job
          names are case sensitive.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about a specific transcription job

       The  following  get-transcription-job  example gets information about a
       specific transcription job. To access the  transcription  results,  use
       the  TranscriptFileUri parameter. Use the MediaFileUri parameter to see
       which audio file you transcribed with this job. You can  use  the  Set-
       tings  object  to see the optional features you've enabled in the tran-
       scription job.

OUTPUT
       TranscriptionJob -> (structure)
          Provides detailed information about the specified transcription job,
          including job status and, if applicable, failure reason.

          TranscriptionJobName -> (string)
              The name of the transcription job. Job names are case  sensitive
              and must be unique within an Amazon Web Services account.

          TranscriptionJobStatus -> (string)
              Provides the status of the specified transcription job.

              If  the  status  is  COMPLETED , the job is finished and you can
              find the results at the location specified in  TranscriptFileUri
              (or  RedactedTranscriptFileUri  ,  if  you  requested transcript
              redaction). If the status is FAILED , FailureReason provides de-
              tails on why your transcription job failed.

          LanguageCode -> (string)
              The  language  code  used to create your transcription job. This
              parameter  is  used  with  single-language  identification.  For
              multi-language identification requests, refer to the plural ver-
              sion of this parameter, LanguageCodes .

          MediaSampleRateHertz -> (integer)
              The sample rate, in hertz, of the audio track in your input  me-
              dia file.

          MediaFormat -> (string)
              The format of the input media file.

          Media -> (structure)
              Provides  the  Amazon  S3 location of the media file you used in
              your request.

              MediaFileUri -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 location of the media file you  want  to  tran-
                 scribe. For example:

                 o s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-media-file.flac

                 o s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/media-files/my-media-file.flac

                 Note that the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input media
                 must be located in the same Amazon Web Services Region  where
                 you're making your transcription request.

              RedactedMediaFileUri -> (string)
                 The  Amazon S3 location of the media file you want to redact.
                 For example:

                 o s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/media-files/my-media-file.flac

                 Note that the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input media
                 must  be located in the same Amazon Web Services Region where
                 you're making your transcription request.

                 WARNING:
                     RedactedMediaFileUri produces a redacted  audio  file  in
                     addition  to  a redacted transcript. It is only supported
                     for Call Analytics (StartCallAnalyticsJob ) transcription
                     requests.

          Transcript -> (structure)
              Provides  you  with the Amazon S3 URI you can use to access your
              transcript.

              TranscriptFileUri -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 location of your transcript. You can  use  this
                 URI to access or download your transcript.

                 If  you  included  OutputBucketName in your transcription job
                 request, this is the URI of that bucket. If you also included
                 OutputKey in your request, your output is located in the path
                 you specified in your request.

                 If you didn't include OutputBucketName in your  transcription
                 job  request,  your transcript is stored in a service-managed
                 bucket, and TranscriptFileUri provides you with  a  temporary
                 URI you can use for secure access to your transcript.

                 NOTE:
                     Temporary  URIs for service-managed Amazon S3 buckets are
                     only valid for 15 minutes. If you get an AccesDenied  er-
                     ror,  you  can  get a new temporary URI by running a Get-
                     TranscriptionJob or ListTranscriptionJob request.

              RedactedTranscriptFileUri -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 location of your redacted transcript.  You  can
                 use this URI to access or download your transcript.

                 If  you  included  OutputBucketName in your transcription job
                 request, this is the URI of that bucket. If you also included
                 OutputKey in your request, your output is located in the path
                 you specified in your request.

                 If you didn't include OutputBucketName in your  transcription
                 job  request,  your transcript is stored in a service-managed
                 bucket, and RedactedTranscriptFileUri  provides  you  with  a
                 temporary  URI  you  can  use for secure access to your tran-
                 script.

                 NOTE:
                     Temporary URIs for service-managed Amazon S3 buckets  are
                     only  valid for 15 minutes. If you get an AccesDenied er-
                     ror, you can get a new temporary URI by  running  a  Get-
                     TranscriptionJob or ListTranscriptionJob request.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time the specified transcription job began process-
              ing.

              Timestamps are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC  .
              For example, 2022-05-04T12:32:58.789000-07:00 represents a tran-
              scription job that started processing at 12:32 PM UTC-7  on  May
              4, 2022.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and  time the specified transcription job request was
              made.

              Timestamps are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC  .
              For example, 2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00 represents a tran-
              scription job that started processing at 12:32 PM UTC-7  on  May
              4, 2022.

          CompletionTime -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time the specified transcription job finished pro-
              cessing.

              Timestamps are in the format YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC  .
              For example, 2022-05-04T12:33:13.922000-07:00 represents a tran-
              scription job that started processing at 12:33 PM UTC-7  on  May
              4, 2022.

          FailureReason -> (string)
              If TranscriptionJobStatus is FAILED , FailureReason contains in-
              formation about why the transcription job request failed.

              The FailureReason field contains one of the following values:

              o Unsupported media format . The media format specified in Medi-
                aFormat  isn't  valid. Refer to MediaFormat for a list of sup-
                ported formats.

              o The media format provided does not match  the  detected  media
                format  .  The  media  format specified in MediaFormat doesn't
                match the format of the input file. Check the media format  of
                your media file and correct the specified value.

              o Invalid sample rate for audio file . The sample rate specified
                in MediaSampleRateHertz isn't valid. The sample rate  must  be
                between 8,000 and 48,000 hertz.

              o The  sample  rate  provided does not match the detected sample
                rate .  The  sample  rate  specified  in  MediaSampleRateHertz
                doesn't  match  the  sample  rate detected in your input media
                file. Check the sample rate of your media file and correct the
                specified value.

              o Invalid  file size: file size too large . The size of your me-
                dia file is larger than what Amazon  Transcribe  can  process.
                For more information, refer to Guidelines and quotas .

              o Invalid  number  of  channels:  number of channels too large .
                Your audio contains more channels than  Amazon  Transcribe  is
                able to process. For more information, refer to Guidelines and
                quotas .

          Settings -> (structure)
              Provides information on any additional settings  that  were  in-
              cluded  in  your  request.  Additional  settings include channel
              identification, alternative transcriptions,  speaker  partition-
              ing, custom vocabularies, and custom vocabulary filters.

              VocabularyName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  custom vocabulary you want to use in your
                 transcription job request. This name is case sensitive,  can-
                 not  contain  spaces, and must be unique within an Amazon Web
                 Services account.

              ShowSpeakerLabels -> (boolean)
                 Enables speaker partitioning (diarization) in your transcrip-
                 tion  output. Speaker partitioning labels the speech from in-
                 dividual speakers in your media file.

                 If you enable ShowSpeakerLabels in  your  request,  you  must
                 also include MaxSpeakerLabels .

                 You can't include both ShowSpeakerLabels and ChannelIdentifi-
                 cation in the same request. Including both parameters returns
                 a BadRequestException .

                 For more information, see Partitioning speakers (diarization)
                 .

              MaxSpeakerLabels -> (integer)
                 Specify the maximum number of speakers you want to  partition
                 in your media.

                 Note that if your media contains more speakers than the spec-
                 ified number, multiple  speakers  are  treated  as  a  single
                 speaker.

                 If  you  specify the MaxSpeakerLabels field, you must set the
                 ShowSpeakerLabels field to true.

              ChannelIdentification -> (boolean)
                 Enables channel identification in multi-channel audio.

                 Channel identification transcribes the audio on each  channel
                 independently,  then appends the output for each channel into
                 one transcript.

                 You can't include both ShowSpeakerLabels and ChannelIdentifi-
                 cation in the same request. Including both parameters returns
                 a BadRequestException .

                 For more information, see Transcribing multi-channel audio .

              ShowAlternatives -> (boolean)
                 To include alternative transcriptions within your  transcrip-
                 tion  output,  include ShowAlternatives in your transcription
                 request.

                 If you have multi-channel audio and  do  not  enable  channel
                 identification,  your  audio  is  transcribed in a continuous
                 manner and your transcript does not separate  the  speech  by
                 channel.

                 If  you include ShowAlternatives , you must also include Max-
                 Alternatives , which is the  maximum  number  of  alternative
                 transcriptions you want Amazon Transcribe to generate.

                 For more information, see Alternative transcriptions .

              MaxAlternatives -> (integer)
                 Indicate the maximum number of alternative transcriptions you
                 want Amazon Transcribe to include in your transcript.

                 If you select a number greater than the number of alternative
                 transcriptions  generated  by Amazon Transcribe, only the ac-
                 tual number of alternative transcriptions are included.

                 If you include MaxAlternatives in your request, you must also
                 include ShowAlternatives with a value of true .

                 For more information, see Alternative transcriptions .

              VocabularyFilterName -> (string)
                 The  name  of the custom vocabulary filter you want to use in
                 your transcription job request. This name is case  sensitive,
                 cannot  contain  spaces,  and must be unique within an Amazon
                 Web Services account.

                 Note that if you include  VocabularyFilterName  in  your  re-
                 quest, you must also include VocabularyFilterMethod .

              VocabularyFilterMethod -> (string)
                 Specify how you want your custom vocabulary filter applied to
                 your transcript.

                 To replace words with *** , choose mask .

                 To delete words, choose remove .

                 To flag words without changing them, choose tag .

          ModelSettings -> (structure)
              Provides information on the custom language model  you  included
              in your request.

              LanguageModelName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the custom language model you want to use when
                 processing your transcription job. Note that custom  language
                 model names are case sensitive.

                 The  language  of  the  specified  custom language model must
                 match the language code that you specify in  your  transcrip-
                 tion  request.  If the languages don't match, the custom lan-
                 guage model isn't applied. There are no  errors  or  warnings
                 associated with a language mismatch.

          JobExecutionSettings -> (structure)
              Provides  information  about how your transcription job was pro-
              cessed. This parameter shows if your request was queued and what
              data access role was used.

              AllowDeferredExecution -> (boolean)
                 Makes  it possible to enable job queuing when your concurrent
                 request limit is exceeded. When AllowDeferredExecution is set
                 to  true  ,  transcription job requests are placed in a queue
                 until the number of jobs falls below the  concurrent  request
                 limit. If AllowDeferredExecution is set to false and the num-
                 ber of transcription job requests exceed the  concurrent  re-
                 quest limit, you get a LimitExceededException error.

                 If  you  include  AllowDeferredExecution in your request, you
                 must also include DataAccessRoleArn .

              DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that  has  per-
                 missions  to  access  the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your
                 input files. If the role that you specify doesnt have the ap-
                 propriate permissions to access the specified Amazon S3 loca-
                 tion, your request fails.

                 IAM  role  ARNs  have   the   format   arn:partition:iam::ac-
                 count:role/role-name-with-path       .      For      example:
                 arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Admin . For more  information,
                 see IAM ARNs .

                 Note  that  if you include DataAccessRoleArn in your request,
                 you must also include AllowDeferredExecution .

          ContentRedaction -> (structure)
              Indicates whether redaction was enabled in your transcript.

              RedactionType -> (string)
                 Specify the category of information you want to  redact;  PII
                 (personally  identifiable  information)  is  the  only  valid
                 value. You can use PiiEntityTypes to choose  which  types  of
                 PII you want to redact.

              RedactionOutput -> (string)
                 Specify  if  you  want  only a redacted transcript, or if you
                 want a redacted and an unredacted transcript.

                 When you choose redacted Amazon  Transcribe  creates  only  a
                 redacted transcript.

                 When  you  choose  redacted_and_unredacted  Amazon Transcribe
                 creates a redacted and an unredacted transcript (as two sepa-
                 rate files).

              PiiEntityTypes -> (list)
                 Specify  which  types  of personally identifiable information
                 (PII) you want to redact in your transcript. You can  include
                 as many types as you'd like, or you can select ALL .

                 (string)

          IdentifyLanguage -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether automatic language identification was enabled
              (TRUE ) for the specified transcription job.

          IdentifyMultipleLanguages -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether automatic  multi-language  identification  was
              enabled (TRUE ) for the specified transcription job.

          LanguageOptions -> (list)
              Provides the language codes you specified in your request.

              (string)

          IdentifiedLanguageScore -> (float)
              The  confidence score associated with the language identified in
              your media file.

              Confidence scores are values between 0 and 1; a larger value in-
              dicates  a  higher probability that the identified language cor-
              rectly matches the language spoken in your media.

          LanguageCodes -> (list)
              The language codes used to create your transcription  job.  This
              parameter  is  used with multi-language identification. For sin-
              gle-language identification requests, refer to the singular ver-
              sion of this parameter, LanguageCode .

              (structure)
                 Provides  information  on  the speech contained in a discreet
                 utterance when multi-language identification  is  enabled  in
                 your  request.  This  utterance  represents a block of speech
                 consisting of one language, preceded or followed by  a  block
                 of speech in a different language.

                 LanguageCode -> (string)
                     Provides  the  language code for each language identified
                     in your media.

                 DurationInSeconds -> (float)
                     Provides the total time, in seconds, each identified lan-
                     guage is spoken in your media.

          Tags -> (list)
              The  tags, each in the form of a key:value pair, assigned to the
              specified transcription job.

              (structure)
                 Adds metadata, in the form of a key:value pair, to the speci-
                 fied resource.

                 For  example, you could add the tag Department:Sales to a re-
                 source to indicate that it pertains  to  your  organization's
                 sales  department. You can also use tags for tag-based access
                 control.

                 To learn more about tagging, see Tagging resources .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The first part of a key:value pair that forms a tag asso-
                     ciated with a given resource. For example, in the tag De-
                     partment:Sales , the key is 'Department'.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag  as-
                     sociated  with  a given resource. For example, in the tag
                     Department:Sales , the value is 'Sales'.

                     Note that you can set the value of  a  tag  to  an  empty
                     string,  but  you  can't  set the value of a tag to null.
                     Omitting the tag value is the  same  as  using  an  empty
                     string.

          Subtitles -> (structure)
              Indicates  whether subtitles were generated with your transcrip-
              tion.

              Formats -> (list)
                 Provides the format of your subtitle files. If  your  request
                 included  both  WebVTT (vtt ) and SubRip (srt ) formats, both
                 formats are shown.

                 (string)

              SubtitleFileUris -> (list)
                 The Amazon S3 location of your transcript. You can  use  this
                 URI  to  access or download your subtitle file. Your subtitle
                 file is stored in the same location as  your  transcript.  If
                 you  specified  both  WebVTT and SubRip subtitle formats, two
                 URIs are provided.

                 If you included OutputBucketName in  your  transcription  job
                 request, this is the URI of that bucket. If you also included
                 OutputKey in your request, your output is located in the path
                 you specified in your request.

                 If  you didn't include OutputBucketName in your transcription
                 job request, your subtitle file is stored in  a  service-man-
                 aged bucket, and TranscriptFileUri provides you with a tempo-
                 rary URI you can use for secure access to your subtitle file.

                 NOTE:
                     Temporary URIs for service-managed Amazon S3 buckets  are
                     only  valid for 15 minutes. If you get an AccesDenied er-
                     ror, you can get a new temporary URI by  running  a  Get-
                     TranscriptionJob or ListTranscriptionJob request.

                 (string)

              OutputStartIndex -> (integer)
                 Provides  the  start  index value for your subtitle files. If
                 you did not specify a value  in  your  request,  the  default
                 value of 0 is used.

          LanguageIdSettings -> (map)
              Provides  the  name  and language of all custom language models,
              custom vocabularies, and custom vocabulary filters that you  in-
              cluded in your request.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 If  using  automatic  language identification in your request
                 and you want to apply a custom language model, a  custom  vo-
                 cabulary,  or a custom vocabulary filter, include LanguageId-
                 Settings with the relevant sub-parameters  (VocabularyName  ,
                 LanguageModelName  ,  and  VocabularyFilterName  ). Note that
                 multi-language  identification  (IdentifyMultipleLanguages  )
                 doesn't support custom language models.
                     LanguageIdSettings  supports  two to five language codes.
                     Each language code you include  can  have  an  associated
                     custom  language model, custom vocabulary, and custom vo-
                     cabulary filter. The language codes that you specify must
                     match  the  languages  of  the associated custom language
                     models, custom vocabularies, and custom  vocabulary  fil-
                     ters.

                 It's  recommended that you include LanguageOptions when using
                 LanguageIdSettings to ensure that the  correct  language  di-
                 alect is identified. For example, if you specify a custom vo-
                 cabulary that is in en-US but  Amazon  Transcribe  determines
                 that the language spoken in your media is en-AU , your custom
                 vocabulary is not applied to your transcription. If  you  in-
                 clude  LanguageOptions  and include en-US as the only English
                 language dialect, your custom vocabulary is applied  to  your
                 transcription.

                 If  you want to include a custom language model with your re-
                 quest but do not want to use automatic  language  identifica-
                 tion,  use  instead  the parameter with the LanguageModelName
                 sub-parameter. If you want to include a custom vocabulary  or
                 a custom vocabulary filter (or both) with your request but do
                 not want to use automatic language  identification,  use  in-
                 stead the parameter with the VocabularyName or VocabularyFil-
                 terName (or both) sub-parameter.

                 VocabularyName -> (string)
                     The name of the custom vocabulary you want  to  use  when
                     processing  your  transcription  job.  Custom  vocabulary
                     names are case sensitive.

                     The language of  the  specified  custom  vocabulary  must
                     match  the  language  code that you specify in your tran-
                     scription request. If the languages don't match, the cus-
                     tom  vocabulary  isn't  applied.  There  are no errors or
                     warnings associated with a language mismatch.

                 VocabularyFilterName -> (string)
                     The name of the custom vocabulary filter you want to  use
                     when processing your transcription job. Custom vocabulary
                     filter names are case sensitive.

                     The language of the specified  custom  vocabulary  filter
                     must  match  the  language  code that you specify in your
                     transcription request. If the languages don't match,  the
                     custom  vocabulary filter isn't applied. There are no er-
                     rors or warnings associated with a language mismatch.

                     Note that if you include VocabularyFilterName in your re-
                     quest, you must also include VocabularyFilterMethod .

                 LanguageModelName -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  custom language model you want to use
                     when processing your transcription job. Note that  custom
                     language model names are case sensitive.

                     The  language of the specified custom language model must
                     match the language code that you specify  in  your  tran-
                     scription request. If the languages don't match, the cus-
                     tom language model isn't applied. There are no errors  or
                     warnings associated with a language mismatch.
