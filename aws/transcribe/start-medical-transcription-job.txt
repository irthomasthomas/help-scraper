NAME
       start-medical-transcription-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Transcribes  the audio from a medical dictation or conversation and ap-
       plies any additional Request Parameters you choose to include  in  your
       request.

       In  addition to many standard transcription features, Amazon Transcribe
       Medical provides you with a robust medical vocabulary and,  optionally,
       content identification, which adds flags to personal health information
       (PHI). To learn more about these features, refer to  How  Amazon  Tran-
       scribe Medical works .

       To  make  a StartMedicalTranscriptionJob request, you must first upload
       your media file into an Amazon S3 bucket; you can then specify  the  S3
       location of the file using the Media parameter.

       You  must  include  the  following parameters in your StartMedicalTran-
       scriptionJob request:

       o region : The Amazon Web Services Region where you are making your re-
         quest.  For a list of Amazon Web Services Regions supported with Ama-
         zon Transcribe, refer to Amazon Transcribe endpoints and quotas .

       o MedicalTranscriptionJobName : A custom name you create for your tran-
         scription job that is unique within your Amazon Web Services account.

       o Media (MediaFileUri ): The Amazon S3 location of your media file.

       o LanguageCode : This must be en-US .

       o OutputBucketName  :  The  Amazon  S3 bucket where you want your tran-
         script stored. If you want your output stored in a sub-folder of this
         bucket, you must also include OutputKey .

       o Specialty : This must be PRIMARYCARE .

       o Type : Choose whether your audio is a conversation or a dictation.

OPTIONS
       --medical-transcription-job-name (string)
          A  unique  name,  chosen by you, for your medical transcription job.
          The name that you specify is also used as the default name  of  your
          transcription  output  file. If you want to specify a different name
          for your transcription output, use the OutputKey parameter.

          This name is case sensitive, cannot  contain  spaces,  and  must  be
          unique within an Amazon Web Services account. If you try to create a
          new job with the same name as an existing job, you get a ConflictEx-
          ception error.

       --language-code (string)
          The  language  code that represents the language spoken in the input
          media file. US English (en-US ) is the only valid value for  medical
          transcription  jobs. Any other value you enter for language code re-
          sults in a BadRequestException error.

          Possible values:

          o af-ZA

       --media-sample-rate-hertz (integer)
          The sample rate, in hertz, of the audio track in  your  input  media
          file.

          If  you don't specify the media sample rate, Amazon Transcribe Medi-
          cal determines it for you. If you specify the sample rate,  it  must
          match  the  rate detected by Amazon Transcribe Medical; if there's a
          mismatch between the value that you specify and the value  detected,
          your job fails. Therefore, in most cases, it's advised to omit Medi-
          aSampleRateHertz and let Amazon  Transcribe  Medical  determine  the
          sample rate.

       --media-format (string)
          Specify the format of your input media file.

          Possible values:

          o mp3

          o mp4

          o wav

          o flac

          o ogg

          o amr

          o webm

       --media (structure)
          Describes  the  Amazon S3 location of the media file you want to use
          in your request.

          For information on supported media formats, refer to the MediaFormat
          parameter  or  the  Media formats section in the Amazon S3 Developer
          Guide.

          MediaFileUri -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 location of the media file you want to transcribe.
              For example:

              o s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-media-file.flac

              o s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/media-files/my-media-file.flac

              Note  that  the  Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input media
              must be located in the same Amazon  Web  Services  Region  where
              you're making your transcription request.

          RedactedMediaFileUri -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 location of the media file you want to redact. For
              example:

              o s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-media-file.flac

              o s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/media-files/my-media-file.flac

              Note that the Amazon S3 bucket that contains  your  input  media
              must  be  located  in  the same Amazon Web Services Region where
              you're making your transcription request.

              WARNING:
                 RedactedMediaFileUri produces a redacted audio file in  addi-
                 tion  to a redacted transcript. It is only supported for Call
                 Analytics (StartCallAnalyticsJob ) transcription requests.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MediaFileUri=string,RedactedMediaFileUri=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MediaFileUri": "string",
            "RedactedMediaFileUri": "string"
          }

       --output-bucket-name (string)
          The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where you want your  medical  tran-
          scription  output  stored.  Do  not  include the S3:// prefix of the
          specified bucket.

          If you want your output to go to a sub-folder of this bucket,  spec-
          ify  it using the OutputKey parameter; OutputBucketName only accepts
          the name of a bucket.

          For example, if  you  want  your  output  stored  in  S3://DOC-EXAM-
          PLE-BUCKET  ,  set OutputBucketName to DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET . However,
          if   you    want    your    output    stored    in    S3://DOC-EXAM-
          PLE-BUCKET/test-files/  , set OutputBucketName to DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET
          and OutputKey to test-files/ .

          Note that Amazon Transcribe must have permission to use  the  speci-
          fied location. You can change Amazon S3 permissions using the Amazon
          Web Services Management Console . See also Permissions Required  for
          IAM User Roles .

       --output-key (string)
          Use in combination with OutputBucketName to specify the output loca-
          tion of your transcript and, optionally, a unique name for your out-
          put file. The default name for your transcription output is the same
          as the name you specified for your medical transcription job  (Medi-
          calTranscriptionJobName ).

          Here are some examples of how you can use OutputKey :

          o If  you  specify  'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the OutputBucketName and
            'my-transcript.json' as the OutputKey , your transcription  output
            path is s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-transcript.json .

          o If  you  specify 'my-first-transcription' as the MedicalTranscrip-
            tionJobName , 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the OutputBucketName  ,  and
            'my-transcript'  as the OutputKey , your transcription output path
            is       s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-transcript/my-first-transcrip-
            tion.json .

          o If  you  specify  'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the OutputBucketName and
            'test-files/my-transcript.json' as the OutputKey , your transcrip-
            tion  output  path  is s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test-files/my-tran-
            script.json .

          o If you specify 'my-first-transcription' as  the  MedicalTranscrip-
            tionJobName  ,  'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the OutputBucketName , and
            'test-files/my-transcript' as the OutputKey ,  your  transcription
            output    path    is   s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test-files/my-tran-
            script/my-first-transcription.json .

          If you specify the name of  an  Amazon  S3  bucket  sub-folder  that
          doesn't exist, one is created for you.

       --output-encryption-kms-key-id (string)
          The  KMS  key  you want to use to encrypt your medical transcription
          output.

          If using a key located in the current Amazon Web  Services  account,
          you can specify your KMS key in one of four ways:

          o Use     the     KMS     key     ID     itself.     For    example,
            1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab .

          o Use an alias for the KMS key ID. For example, alias/ExampleAlias .

          o Use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS key ID.  For  exam-
            ple,                                        arn:aws:kms:region:ac-
            count-ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab .

          o Use the ARN for the KMS key alias.  For  example,  arn:aws:kms:re-
            gion:account-ID:alias/ExampleAlias .

          If  using  a  key located in a different Amazon Web Services account
          than the current Amazon Web Services account, you can  specify  your
          KMS key in one of two ways:

          o Use  the  ARN  for  the  KMS  key ID. For example, arn:aws:kms:re-
            gion:account-ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab .

          o Use the ARN for the KMS key alias.  For  example,  arn:aws:kms:re-
            gion:account-ID:alias/ExampleAlias .

          If  you  don't  specify  an encryption key, your output is encrypted
          with the default Amazon S3 key (SSE-S3).

          If you specify a KMS key to encrypt your output, you must also spec-
          ify an output location using the OutputLocation parameter.

          Note  that  the  user making the request must have permission to use
          the specified KMS key.

       --kms-encryption-context (map)
          A map of plain text, non-secret key:value pairs, known as encryption
          context  pairs,  that  provide  an  added layer of security for your
          data.  For  more  information,  see  KMS  encryption   context   and
          Asymmetric keys in KMS .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --settings (structure)
          Specify  additional  optional  settings  in  your request, including
          channel identification, alternative transcriptions, and speaker par-
          titioning.  You  can  use  that to apply custom vocabularies to your
          transcription job.

          ShowSpeakerLabels -> (boolean)
              Enables speaker partitioning (diarization) in your transcription
              output.  Speaker  partitioning labels the speech from individual
              speakers in your media file.

              If you enable ShowSpeakerLabels in your request, you  must  also
              include MaxSpeakerLabels .

              You can't include ShowSpeakerLabels and ChannelIdentification in
              the same request. Including both parameters returns a BadReques-
              tException .

              For more information, see Partitioning speakers (diarization) .

          MaxSpeakerLabels -> (integer)
              Specify  the maximum number of speakers you want to partition in
              your media.

              Note that if your media contains more speakers than  the  speci-
              fied number, multiple speakers are treated as a single speaker.

              If  you  specify  the  MaxSpeakerLabels  field, you must set the
              ShowSpeakerLabels field to true.

          ChannelIdentification -> (boolean)
              Enables channel identification in multi-channel audio.

              Channel identification transcribes the audio on each channel in-
              dependently,  then  appends the output for each channel into one
              transcript.

              If you have multi-channel audio and do not enable channel  iden-
              tification, your audio is transcribed in a continuous manner and
              your transcript does not separate the speech by channel.

              You can't include both ShowSpeakerLabels and  ChannelIdentifica-
              tion  in  the  same request. Including both parameters returns a
              BadRequestException .

              For more information, see Transcribing multi-channel audio .

          ShowAlternatives -> (boolean)
              To include alternative transcriptions within your  transcription
              output, include ShowAlternatives in your transcription request.

              If  you  include ShowAlternatives , you must also include MaxAl-
              ternatives , which is the maximum number  of  alternative  tran-
              scriptions you want Amazon Transcribe Medical to generate.

              For more information, see Alternative transcriptions .

          MaxAlternatives -> (integer)
              Indicate  the  maximum  number of alternative transcriptions you
              want Amazon Transcribe Medical to include in your transcript.

              If you select a number greater than the  number  of  alternative
              transcriptions  generated by Amazon Transcribe Medical, only the
              actual number of alternative transcriptions are included.

              If you include MaxAlternatives in your request,  you  must  also
              include ShowAlternatives with a value of true .

              For more information, see Alternative transcriptions .

          VocabularyName -> (string)
              The  name of the custom vocabulary you want to use when process-
              ing your medical transcription job. Custom vocabulary names  are
              case sensitive.

              The  language  of the specified custom vocabulary must match the
              language code that you specify in your transcription request. If
              the  languages don't match, the custom vocabulary isn't applied.
              There are no errors or warnings associated with a language  mis-
              match. US English (en-US ) is the only valid language for Amazon
              Transcribe Medical.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ShowSpeakerLabels=boolean,MaxSpeakerLabels=integer,ChannelIdentification=boolean,ShowAlternatives=boolean,MaxAlternatives=integer,VocabularyName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ShowSpeakerLabels": true|false,

            "MaxAlternatives": integer,
            "VocabularyName": "string"
          }

       --content-identification-type (string)
          Labels all personal health  information  (PHI)  identified  in  your
          transcript.  For  more  information, see Identifying personal health
          information (PHI) in a transcription .

          Possible values:

          o PHI

       --specialty (string)
          Specify the predominant medical specialty represented in your media.
          For  batch  transcriptions,  PRIMARYCARE is the only valid value. If
          you require additional specialties, refer to .

          Possible values:

          o PRIMARYCARE

       --type (string)
          Specify whether your input media contains only one person (DICTATION
          ) or contains a conversation between two people (CONVERSATION ).

          For  example,  DICTATION  could  be  used for a medical professional
          wanting to transcribe voice memos; CONVERSATION could  be  used  for
          transcribing the doctor-patient dialogue during the patient's office
          visit.

          Possible values:

          o CONVERSATION

          o DICTATION

       --tags (list)
          Adds one or more custom tags, each in the form of a key:value  pair,
          to  a  new  medical transcription job at the time you start this new
          job.

          To learn more about using tags  with  Amazon  Transcribe,  refer  to
          Tagging resources .

          (structure)
              Adds metadata, in the form of a key:value pair, to the specified
              resource.

              For example, you could add the tag  Department:Sales  to  a  re-
              source to indicate that it pertains to your organization's sales
              department. You can also use tags for tag-based access control.

              To learn more about tagging, see Tagging resources .

              Key -> (string)
                 The first part of a key:value pair that forms a  tag  associ-
                 ated  with  a given resource. For example, in the tag Depart-
                 ment:Sales , the key is 'Department'.

              Value -> (string)
                 The second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag  associ-
                 ated  with  a given resource. For example, in the tag Depart-
                 ment:Sales , the value is 'Sales'.

                 Note that you can set the value of a tag to an empty  string,
                 but  you  can't  set the value of a tag to null. Omitting the
                 tag value is the same as using an empty string.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

              4, 2022.

          FailureReason -> (string)
              If TranscriptionJobStatus is FAILED , FailureReason contains in-
              formation about why the transcription job request failed.

              The FailureReason field contains one of the following values:

              o Unsupported media format . The media format specified in Medi-
                aFormat isn't valid. Refer to MediaFormat for a list  of  sup-
                ported formats.

              o The  media  format  provided does not match the detected media
                format . The media format  specified  in  MediaFormat  doesn't
                match  the format of the input file. Check the media format of
                your media file and correct the specified value.

              o Invalid sample rate for audio file . The sample rate specified
                in  MediaSampleRateHertz  isn't valid. The sample rate must be
                between 16,000 and 48,000 hertz.

              o The sample rate provided does not match  the  detected  sample
                rate  .  The  sample  rate  specified  in MediaSampleRateHertz
                doesn't match the sample rate detected  in  your  input  media
                file. Check the sample rate of your media file and correct the
                specified value.

              o Invalid file size: file size too large . The size of your  me-
                dia  file  is  larger than what Amazon Transcribe can process.
                For more information, refer to Guidelines and quotas .

              o Invalid number of channels: number of  channels  too  large  .
                Your  audio  contains  more channels than Amazon Transcribe is
                able to process. For more information, refer to Guidelines and
                quotas .

          Settings -> (structure)
              Provides  information  on  any additional settings that were in-
              cluded in your  request.  Additional  settings  include  channel
              identification,  alternative  transcriptions, speaker partition-
              ing, custom vocabularies, and custom vocabulary filters.

              ShowSpeakerLabels -> (boolean)
                 Enables speaker partitioning (diarization) in your transcrip-
                 tion  output. Speaker partitioning labels the speech from in-
                 dividual speakers in your media file.

                 If you enable ShowSpeakerLabels in  your  request,  you  must
                 also include MaxSpeakerLabels .

                 You can't include ShowSpeakerLabels and ChannelIdentification
                 in the same request.  Including  both  parameters  returns  a
                 BadRequestException .

                 For more information, see Partitioning speakers (diarization)
                 .

              MaxSpeakerLabels -> (integer)
                 Specify the maximum number of speakers you want to  partition
                 in your media.

                 Note that if your media contains more speakers than the spec-
                 ified number, multiple  speakers  are  treated  as  a  single
                 speaker.

                 If  you  specify the MaxSpeakerLabels field, you must set the
                 ShowSpeakerLabels field to true.

              ChannelIdentification -> (boolean)
                 Enables channel identification in multi-channel audio.

                 Channel identification transcribes the audio on each  channel
                 independently,  then appends the output for each channel into
                 one transcript.

                 If you have multi-channel audio and  do  not  enable  channel
                 identification,  your  audio  is  transcribed in a continuous
                 manner and your transcript does not separate  the  speech  by
                 channel.

                 You can't include both ShowSpeakerLabels and ChannelIdentifi-
                 cation in the same request. Including both parameters returns
                 a BadRequestException .

                 For more information, see Transcribing multi-channel audio .

              ShowAlternatives -> (boolean)
                 To  include alternative transcriptions within your transcrip-
                 tion output, include ShowAlternatives in  your  transcription
                 request.

                 If  you include ShowAlternatives , you must also include Max-
                 Alternatives , which is the  maximum  number  of  alternative
                 transcriptions  you  want Amazon Transcribe Medical to gener-
                 ate.

                 For more information, see Alternative transcriptions .

              MaxAlternatives -> (integer)
                 Indicate the maximum number of alternative transcriptions you
                 want Amazon Transcribe Medical to include in your transcript.

                 If you select a number greater than the number of alternative
                 transcriptions generated by Amazon Transcribe  Medical,  only
                 the actual number of alternative transcriptions are included.

                 If you include MaxAlternatives in your request, you must also
                 include ShowAlternatives with a value of true .

                 For more information, see Alternative transcriptions .

              VocabularyName -> (string)
                 The name of the custom vocabulary you want to use  when  pro-
                 cessing  your  medical  transcription  job. Custom vocabulary
                 names are case sensitive.

                 The language of the specified custom  vocabulary  must  match
                 the  language code that you specify in your transcription re-
                 quest. If the languages don't match,  the  custom  vocabulary
                 isn't  applied.  There  are  no errors or warnings associated
                 with a language mismatch. US English (en-US  )  is  the  only
                 valid language for Amazon Transcribe Medical.

          ContentIdentificationType -> (string)
              Indicates  whether  content  identification was enabled for your
              transcription request.

          Specialty -> (string)
              Describes the medical specialty represented in your media.

          Type -> (string)
              Indicates whether the input media is a dictation or a  conversa-
              tion, as specified in the StartMedicalTranscriptionJob request.

          Tags -> (list)
              The  tags, each in the form of a key:value pair, assigned to the
              specified medical transcription job.

              (structure)
                 Adds metadata, in the form of a key:value pair, to the speci-
                 fied resource.

                 For  example, you could add the tag Department:Sales to a re-
                 source to indicate that it pertains  to  your  organization's
                 sales  department. You can also use tags for tag-based access
                 control.

                 To learn more about tagging, see Tagging resources .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The first part of a key:value pair that forms a tag asso-
                     ciated with a given resource. For example, in the tag De-
                     partment:Sales , the key is 'Department'.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag  as-
                     sociated  with  a given resource. For example, in the tag
                     Department:Sales , the value is 'Sales'.

                     Note that you can set the value of  a  tag  to  an  empty
                     string,  but  you  can't  set the value of a tag to null.
                     Omitting the tag value is the  same  as  using  an  empty
                     string.
