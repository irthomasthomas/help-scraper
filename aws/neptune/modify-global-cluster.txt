OPTIONS
       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  DB  cluster  identifier  for the global cluster being modified.
          This parameter is not case-sensitive.

          Constraints: Must match the identifier of an existing  global  data-
          base cluster.

       --new-global-cluster-identifier (string)
          A  new  cluster  identifier  to  assign to the global database. This
          value is stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o The first character must be a letter.

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

          Example: my-cluster2

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          Indicates whether the global database has  deletion  protection  en-
          abled.  The  global database cannot be deleted when deletion protec-
          tion is enabled.

       --engine-version (string)
          The version number of the database engine to which you want  to  up-
          grade.  Changing this parameter will result in an outage. The change
          is applied during the next maintenance  window  unless  ApplyImmedi-
          ately is enabled.

          To  list  all of the available Neptune engine versions, use the fol-
          lowing command:

       --allow-major-version-upgrade | --no-allow-major-version-upgrade (bool-
       ean)
          A value that indicates whether major version upgrades are allowed.

          Constraints:  You must allow major version upgrades if you specify a
          value for the EngineVersion parameter that is a different major ver-
          sion than the DB cluster's current version.

          If  you  upgrade the major version of a global database, the cluster
          and DB instance parameter groups are set to  the  default  parameter
          groups for the new version, so you will need to apply any custom pa-
          rameter groups after completing the upgrade.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                 ondary clusters associated with an Neptune global database.
