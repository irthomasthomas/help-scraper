MODIFY-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()                                MODIFY-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()



NAME
       modify-global-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Modify  a  setting for an Amazon Neptune global cluster. You can change
       one or more database configuration parameters by specifying  these  pa-
       rameters and their new values in the request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-global-cluster
          --global-cluster-identifier <value>
          [--new-global-cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection]
          [--engine-version <value>]
          [--allow-major-version-upgrade | --no-allow-major-version-upgrade]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  DB  cluster  identifier  for the global cluster being modified.
          This parameter is not case-sensitive.

          Constraints: Must match the identifier of an existing  global  data-
          base cluster.

       --new-global-cluster-identifier (string)
          A  new  cluster  identifier  to  assign to the global database. This
          value is stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o The first character must be a letter.

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

          Example: my-cluster2

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          Indicates whether the global database has  deletion  protection  en-
          abled.  The  global database cannot be deleted when deletion protec-
          tion is enabled.

       --engine-version (string)
          The version number of the database engine to which you want  to  up-
          grade.  Changing this parameter will result in an outage. The change
          is applied during the next maintenance  window  unless  ApplyImmedi-
          ately is enabled.

          To  list  all of the available Neptune engine versions, use the fol-
          lowing command:

       --allow-major-version-upgrade | --no-allow-major-version-upgrade (bool-
       ean)
          A value that indicates whether major version upgrades are allowed.

          Constraints:  You must allow major version upgrades if you specify a
          value for the EngineVersion parameter that is a different major ver-
          sion than the DB cluster's current version.

          If  you  upgrade the major version of a global database, the cluster
          and DB instance parameter groups are set to  the  default  parameter
          groups for the new version, so you will need to apply any custom pa-
          rameter groups after completing the upgrade.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GlobalCluster -> (structure)
          Contains the details of an Amazon Neptune global database.

          This  data type is used as a response element for the  CreateGlobal-
          Cluster ,  DescribeGlobalClusters ,  ModifyGlobalCluster ,   Delete-
          GlobalCluster  ,  FailoverGlobalCluster , and  RemoveFromGlobalClus-
          ter actions.

          GlobalClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains a user-supplied  global  database  cluster  identifier.
              This identifier is the unique key that identifies a global data-
              base.

          GlobalClusterResourceId -> (string)
              An immutable identifier for the global database that  is  unique
              within  in  all  regions. This identifier is found in CloudTrail
              log entries whenever the KMS key for the DB cluster is accessed.

          GlobalClusterArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the global database.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this global database.

          Engine -> (string)
              The Neptune database engine used by the global  database  ("nep-
              tune" ).

          EngineVersion -> (string)
              The Neptune engine version used by the global database.

          StorageEncrypted -> (boolean)
              The storage encryption setting for the global database.

          DeletionProtection -> (boolean)
              The deletion protection setting for the global database.

          GlobalClusterMembers -> (list)
              A list of cluster ARNs and instance ARNs for all the DB clusters
              that are part of the global database.

              (structure)
                 A data structure with information about any primary and  sec-
                 ondary clusters associated with an Neptune global database.

                 DBClusterArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for each Neptune cluster.

                 Readers -> (list)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) for each read-only sec-
                     ondary cluster associated with the Neptune  global  data-
                     base.

                     (string)

                 IsWriter -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  the  Neptune  cluster  is the primary
                     cluster (that is, has read-write capability) for the Nep-
                     tune global database with which it is associated.
