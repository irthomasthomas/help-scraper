OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The customer identifier or the ARN of your DB instance.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ValidDBInstanceModificationsMessage -> (structure)
          Information  about  valid modifications that you can make to your DB
          instance. Contains the result of  a  successful  call  to  the   De-
          scribeValidDBInstanceModifications action. You can use this informa-
          tion when you call  ModifyDBInstance .

          Storage -> (list)
              Valid storage options for your DB instance.

              (structure)
                 Information about valid modifications that you  can  make  to
                 your DB instance.

                 Contains  the  result  of  a  successful  call  to  the   De-
                 scribeValidDBInstanceModifications action.

                 StorageType -> (string)
                     The valid storage types for your DB instance.  For  exam-
                     ple, gp2, io1.

                 StorageSize -> (list)
                     The valid range of storage in gibibytes. For example, 100
                     to 16384.

                     (structure)
                        A range of integer values.

                        From -> (integer)
                            The minimum value in the range.

                        To -> (integer)
                            The maximum value in the range.

                        Step -> (integer)
                            The step value for the range. For example, if  you
                            have a range of 5,000 to 10,000, with a step value
                            of 1,000, the valid values start at 5,000 and step
                            up  by  1,000.  Even  though  7,500  is within the
                            range, it isn't a valid value for the  range.  The
                            valid values are 5,000, 6,000, 7,000, 8,000...

                 ProvisionedIops -> (list)
                     The   valid  range  of  provisioned  IOPS.  For  example,
                     1000-20000.

                     (structure)
                        A range of integer values.

                        From -> (integer)
                            The minimum value in the range.

                        To -> (integer)
                            The maximum value in the range.

                        Step -> (integer)
                            The step value for the range. For example, if  you
                            have a range of 5,000 to 10,000, with a step value
                            of 1,000, the valid values start at 5,000 and step
                            up  by  1,000.  Even  though  7,500  is within the
                            range, it isn't a valid value for the  range.  The
                            valid values are 5,000, 6,000, 7,000, 8,000...

                 IopsToStorageRatio -> (list)
                     The valid range of Provisioned IOPS to gibibytes of stor-
                     age multiplier. For example, 3-10, which means that  pro-
                     visioned IOPS can be between 3 and 10 times storage.

                     (structure)
                        A range of double values.

                        From -> (double)
