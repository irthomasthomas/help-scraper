       can't modify the source identifiers using this call; to  change  source
       identifiers for a subscription, use the  AddSourceIdentifierToSubscrip-
       tion and  RemoveSourceIdentifierFromSubscription calls.

       You can see a list of the event categories for a  given  SourceType  by
       using the DescribeEventCategories action.

          The name of the event notification subscription.

       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the SNS topic created for event

          topic and subscribe to it.

       --source-type (string)
          The  type  of  source that is generating the events. For example, if
          you want to be notified of events generated by a  DB  instance,  you
          would set this parameter to db-instance. if this value is not speci-
          fied, all events are returned.

          Valid values: db-instance | db-parameter-group | db-security-group |
          db-snapshot

       --event-categories (list)
          A  list  of  event categories for a SourceType that you want to sub-
          scribe to. You can see a list of the categories for a given  Source-
          Type by using the DescribeEventCategories action.

          (string)

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-

       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
