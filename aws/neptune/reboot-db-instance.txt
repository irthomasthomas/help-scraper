REBOOT-DB-INSTANCE()                                      REBOOT-DB-INSTANCE()



NAME
       reboot-db-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       You might need to reboot your DB instance, usually for maintenance rea-
       sons. For example, if you make certain modifications, or if you  change
       the DB parameter group associated with the DB instance, you must reboot
       the instance for the changes to take effect.

       Rebooting a DB instance restarts the database engine service. Rebooting
       a  DB  instance  results in a momentary outage, during which the DB in-
       stance status is set to rebooting.

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The DB instance identifier. This parameter is stored as a  lowercase
          string.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing DBInstance.

       --force-failover | --no-force-failover (boolean)
          When true , the reboot is conducted through a MultiAZ failover.

          Constraint: You can't specify true if the instance is not configured
          for MultiAZ.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
