DESCRIBE-PENDING-MAINTENANCE-ACTIONS()  DESCRIBE-PENDING-MAINTENANCE-ACTIONS()



NAME
       describe-pending-maintenance-actions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of resources (for example, DB instances) that have at
       least one pending maintenance action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-pending-maintenance-actions is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: PendingMaintenanceActions

OPTIONS
       --resource-identifier (string)
          The ARN of a resource to return pending maintenance actions for.

       --filters (list)
          A  filter  that  specifies  one  or more resources to return pending
          maintenance actions for.

          Supported filters:

          o db-cluster-id - Accepts DB cluster identifiers and DB cluster Ama-
            zon  Resource  Names  (ARNs).  The  results list will only include
            pending maintenance actions for  the  DB  clusters  identified  by
            these ARNs.

          o db-instance-id  -  Accepts DB instance identifiers and DB instance
            ARNs. The results list will only include pending  maintenance  ac-
            tions for the DB instances identified by these ARNs.

          (structure)
              This type is not currently supported.

              Name -> (string)
                 This parameter is not currently supported.

              Values -> (list)
                 This parameter is not currently supported.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       PendingMaintenanceActions -> (list)
          A list of the pending maintenance actions for the resource.

          (structure)
              Describes the pending maintenance actions for a resource.

              ResourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 The ARN of the resource that has pending maintenance actions.

              PendingMaintenanceActionDetails -> (list)
                 A  list  that  provides details about the pending maintenance
                 actions for the resource.

                 (structure)
                     Provides information about a pending  maintenance  action
                     for a resource.

                     Action -> (string)
                        The  type of pending maintenance action that is avail-
                        able for the resource.

                     AutoAppliedAfterDate -> (timestamp)
                        The date of the maintenance window when the action  is
                        applied.  The maintenance action is applied to the re-
                        source during its first maintenance window after  this
                        date.  If this date is specified, any next-maintenance
                        opt-in requests are ignored.

                     ForcedApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                        The date when the maintenance action is  automatically
                        applied.  The maintenance action is applied to the re-
                        source on this date regardless of the maintenance win-
                        dow  for  the resource. If this date is specified, any
                        immediate opt-in requests are ignored.

                     OptInStatus -> (string)
                        Indicates the type of opt-in request that has been re-
                        ceived for the resource.

                     CurrentApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                        The effective date when the pending maintenance action
                        is applied to the resource. This date takes  into  ac-
                        count opt-in requests received from the  ApplyPending-
                        MaintenanceAction API, the AutoAppliedAfterDate ,  and
                        the ForcedApplyDate . This value is blank if an opt-in
                        request has not been received  and  nothing  has  been
                        specified as AutoAppliedAfterDate or ForcedApplyDate .

                     Description -> (string)
                        A  description providing more detail about the mainte-
                        nance action.

       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous DescribePending-
          MaintenanceActions  request. If this parameter is specified, the re-
          sponse includes only records beyond the marker, up to  a  number  of
          records specified by MaxRecords .
