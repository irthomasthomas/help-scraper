NAME
       describe-db-engine-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of the available DB engines.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-engine-versions  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: DBEngineVersions

OPTIONS
       --engine (string)
          The database engine to return.

       --engine-version (string)
          The database engine version to return.

          Example: 5.1.49

       --db-parameter-group-family (string)
          The name of a specific DB parameter group family to  return  details
          for.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match an existing DBParameterGroupFamily.

       --filters (list)
          Not currently supported.

          (structure)
              This type is not currently supported.

              Name -> (string)
                 This parameter is not currently supported.

              Values -> (list)
                 This parameter is not currently supported.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --default-only | --no-default-only (boolean)
          Indicates  that  only the default version of the specified engine or
          engine and major version combination is returned.

       --list-supported-character-sets  |   --no-list-supported-character-sets
       (boolean)
          If this parameter is specified and the requested engine supports the
          CharacterSetName parameter for CreateDBInstance , the  response  in-
          cludes a list of supported character sets for each engine version.

       --list-supported-timezones | --no-list-supported-timezones (boolean)
          If this parameter is specified and the requested engine supports the
          TimeZone parameter for CreateDBInstance , the  response  includes  a
          list of supported time zones for each engine version.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .
