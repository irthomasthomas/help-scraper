NAME
       delete-db-cluster-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  DB  cluster  snapshot. If the snapshot is being copied, the
       copy operation is terminated.

       NOTE:
          The DB cluster snapshot  must  be  in  the  available  state  to  be
          deleted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the DB cluster snapshot to delete.

          Constraints:  Must be the name of an existing DB cluster snapshot in
          the available state.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       DBClusterSnapshot -> (structure)
          Contains the details for an Amazon Neptune DB cluster snapshot

          This data type is used as a response element in the  DescribeDBClus-
          terSnapshots action.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides the list of EC2 Availability Zones  that  instances  in
              the DB cluster snapshot can be restored in.

              (string)

          DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier -> (string)
              Specifies  the  identifier for a DB cluster snapshot. Must match
              the identifier of an existing snapshot.

              After you restore a DB cluster using a  DBClusterSnapshotIdenti-
              fier , you must specify the same DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier for
              any future updates to the DB  cluster.  When  you  specify  this
              property  for an update, the DB cluster is not restored from the
              snapshot again, and the data in the database is not changed.

              However, if you don't specify the DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier  ,
              an  empty  DB cluster is created, and the original DB cluster is
              deleted. If you specify a property that is  different  from  the
              previous  snapshot  restore property, the DB cluster is restored
              from the snapshot specified by the DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier ,
              and the original DB cluster is deleted.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Specifies  the DB cluster identifier of the DB cluster that this
              DB cluster snapshot was created from.

          SnapshotCreateTime -> (timestamp)
              Provides the time when the snapshot was taken, in Universal  Co-
              ordinated Time (UTC).

          Engine -> (string)
              Specifies the name of the database engine.

          AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
              Specifies the allocated storage size in gibibytes (GiB).

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the status of this DB cluster snapshot.

          Port -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  port that the DB cluster was listening on at the
              time of the snapshot.

          VpcId -> (string)
              Provides the VPC ID associated with the DB cluster snapshot.

          ClusterCreateTime -> (timestamp)
              Specifies the time when the DB cluster was created, in Universal
              Coordinated Time (UTC).

          MasterUsername -> (string)
              Not supported by Neptune.

          EngineVersion -> (string)
              Provides  the version of the database engine for this DB cluster
              snapshot.

          LicenseModel -> (string)
              Provides the license model information for this DB cluster snap-
              shot.

          SnapshotType -> (string)
              Provides the type of the DB cluster snapshot.

          PercentProgress -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  percentage  of  the estimated data that has been
              transferred.

          StorageEncrypted -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the DB cluster snapshot is encrypted.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              If StorageEncrypted is true, the Amazon KMS key  identifier  for
              the encrypted DB cluster snapshot.

          DBClusterSnapshotArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the DB cluster snapshot.

          SourceDBClusterSnapshotArn -> (string)
              If  the  DB cluster snapshot was copied from a source DB cluster
              snapshot, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the source DB clus-
              ter snapshot, otherwise, a null value.

          IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled -> (boolean)
