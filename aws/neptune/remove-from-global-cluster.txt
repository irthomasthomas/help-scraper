NAME
       remove-from-global-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Detaches  a  Neptune  DB cluster from a Neptune global database. A sec-
       ondary cluster becomes a normal standalone cluster with read-write  ca-
       pability instead of being read-only, and no longer receives data from a
       the primary cluster.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            remove-from-global-cluster
          --global-cluster-identifier <value>
          --db-cluster-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the Neptune global database from which  to  detach
          the specified Neptune DB cluster.

       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) identifying the cluster to be de-
          tached from the Neptune global database cluster.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GlobalCluster -> (structure)
          Contains the details of an Amazon Neptune global database.

          This  data type is used as a response element for the  CreateGlobal-
          Cluster ,  DescribeGlobalClusters ,  ModifyGlobalCluster ,   Delete-
          GlobalCluster  ,  FailoverGlobalCluster , and  RemoveFromGlobalClus-
          ter actions.

          GlobalClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains a user-supplied  global  database  cluster  identifier.
              This identifier is the unique key that identifies a global data-
              base.

          GlobalClusterResourceId -> (string)
              An immutable identifier for the global database that  is  unique
              within  in  all  regions. This identifier is found in CloudTrail
              log entries whenever the KMS key for the DB cluster is accessed.

          GlobalClusterArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the global database.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this global database.

          Engine -> (string)
              The Neptune database engine used by the global  database  ("nep-
              tune" ).

          EngineVersion -> (string)
              The Neptune engine version used by the global database.

          StorageEncrypted -> (boolean)
              The storage encryption setting for the global database.

          DeletionProtection -> (boolean)
              The deletion protection setting for the global database.

          GlobalClusterMembers -> (list)
              A list of cluster ARNs and instance ARNs for all the DB clusters
              that are part of the global database.

              (structure)
                 A data structure with information about any primary and  sec-
                 ondary clusters associated with an Neptune global database.

                 DBClusterArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for each Neptune cluster.

                 Readers -> (list)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) for each read-only sec-
                     ondary cluster associated with the Neptune  global  data-
                     base.

                     (string)

                 IsWriter -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  the  Neptune  cluster  is the primary
                     cluster (that is, has read-write capability) for the Nep-
                     tune global database with which it is associated.
