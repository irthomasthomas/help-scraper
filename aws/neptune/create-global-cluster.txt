CREATE-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()                                CREATE-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()



NAME
       create-global-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  Neptune  global  database spread across multiple Amazon Re-
       gions. The global database  contains  a  single  primary  cluster  with
       read-write  capability,  and  read-only secondary clusters that receive
       data from the primary cluster through high-speed replication  performed
       by the Neptune storage subsystem.

       You  can create a global database that is initially empty, and then add
       a primary cluster and secondary clusters to it, or you can  specify  an
       existing Neptune cluster during the create operation to become the pri-
       mary cluster of the global database.

SYNOPSIS
            create-global-cluster
          --global-cluster-identifier <value>
          [--source-db-cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--engine <value>]
          [--engine-version <value>]
          [--deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection]
          [--storage-encrypted | --no-storage-encrypted]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The cluster identifier of the new global database cluster.

       --source-db-cluster-identifier (string)
          (Optional ) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an existing Neptune DB
          cluster to use as the primary cluster of the new global database.

       --engine (string)
          The name of the database engine to be used in the global database.

          Valid values: neptune

       --engine-version (string)
          The Neptune engine version to be used by the global database.

          Valid values: 1.2.0.0 or above.

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          The  deletion  protection  setting  for the new global database. The
          global database can't be deleted when  deletion  protection  is  en-
          abled.

       --storage-encrypted | --no-storage-encrypted (boolean)
          The storage encryption setting for the new global database cluster.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GlobalCluster -> (structure)
          Contains the details of an Amazon Neptune global database.

          This data type is used as a response element for the   CreateGlobal-
          Cluster  ,  DescribeGlobalClusters ,  ModifyGlobalCluster ,  Delete-
          GlobalCluster ,  FailoverGlobalCluster , and   RemoveFromGlobalClus-
          ter actions.

          GlobalClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains  a  user-supplied  global  database cluster identifier.
              This identifier is the unique key that identifies a global data-
              base.

          GlobalClusterResourceId -> (string)
              An  immutable  identifier for the global database that is unique
              within in all regions. This identifier is  found  in  CloudTrail
              log entries whenever the KMS key for the DB cluster is accessed.

          GlobalClusterArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the global database.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this global database.

          Engine -> (string)
              The  Neptune  database engine used by the global database ("nep-
              tune" ).

          EngineVersion -> (string)
              The Neptune engine version used by the global database.

          StorageEncrypted -> (boolean)
              The storage encryption setting for the global database.

          DeletionProtection -> (boolean)
              The deletion protection setting for the global database.

          GlobalClusterMembers -> (list)
              A list of cluster ARNs and instance ARNs for all the DB clusters
              that are part of the global database.

              (structure)
                 A  data structure with information about any primary and sec-
                 ondary clusters associated with an Neptune global database.

                 DBClusterArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for each Neptune cluster.

                 Readers -> (list)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for  each  read-only  sec-
                     ondary  cluster  associated with the Neptune global data-
                     base.

                     (string)

                 IsWriter -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether the  Neptune  cluster  is  the  primary
                     cluster (that is, has read-write capability) for the Nep-
                     tune global database with which it is associated.
