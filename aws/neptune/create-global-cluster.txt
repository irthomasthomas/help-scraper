CREATE-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()                                CREATE-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()



NAME
       create-global-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  Neptune  global  database spread across multiple Amazon Re-
       gions. The global database  contains  a  single  primary  cluster  with
       read-write  capability,  and  read-only secondary clusters that receive
       data from the primary cluster through high-speed replication  performed
       by the Neptune storage subsystem.

       You  can create a global database that is initially empty, and then add
       a primary cluster and secondary clusters to it, or you can  specify  an
       existing Neptune cluster during the create operation to become the pri-
       mary cluster of the global database.

OPTIONS
       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The cluster identifier of the new global database cluster.

       --source-db-cluster-identifier (string)
          (Optional ) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an existing Neptune DB
          cluster to use as the primary cluster of the new global database.

       --engine (string)
          The name of the database engine to be used in the global database.

          Valid values: neptune

       --engine-version (string)
          The Neptune engine version to be used by the global database.

          Valid values: 1.2.0.0 or above.

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          The  deletion  protection  setting  for the new global database. The
          global database can't be deleted when  deletion  protection  is  en-
          abled.

       --storage-encrypted | --no-storage-encrypted (boolean)
          The storage encryption setting for the new global database cluster.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
