          rameter is not case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster.

       --new-db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The new DB cluster identifier for the DB cluster when renaming a  DB
          cluster. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens

          o The first character must be a letter

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

          Example: my-cluster2

       --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately (boolean)
          A value that specifies whether the modifications in this request and
          any pending modifications are asynchronously applied as soon as pos-
          sible,  regardless of the PreferredMaintenanceWindow setting for the
          DB cluster. If this parameter is set to false , changes  to  the  DB
          cluster are applied during the next maintenance window.

          The  ApplyImmediately  parameter only affects NewDBClusterIdentifier
          values. If you set the ApplyImmediately parameter  value  to  false,
          then changes to NewDBClusterIdentifier values are applied during the

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the

          ters .

          AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
              AllocatedStorage always returns 1, because  Neptune  DB  cluster
              storage  size is not fixed, but instead automatically adjusts as
              needed.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides the list of EC2 Availability Zones  that  instances  in
              the DB cluster can be created in.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  number  of days for which automatic DB snapshots

          CharacterSetName -> (string)
              Not supported by Neptune.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Contains the name of the initial database  of  this  DB  cluster
              that  was provided at create time, if one was specified when the
              DB cluster was created. This same name is returned for the  life
              of the DB cluster.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains  a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This identifier
              is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

              Specifies the name of the DB cluster parameter group for the  DB
              cluster.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the DB
              cluster, including the name, description,  and  subnets  in  the
              subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this DB cluster.

          PercentProgress -> (string)

              the DB cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The  reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint for
              a DB cluster load-balances connections across the Read  Replicas
              that  are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new con-
              nections to the reader endpoint, Neptune distributes the connec-
              tion  requests  among  the Read Replicas in the DB cluster. This
              functionality can help balance your read workload across  multi-
              ple Read Replicas in your DB cluster.

              If  a  failover  occurs,  and the Read Replica that you are con-
              nected to is promoted to be the primary instance,  your  connec-
              tion is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other
              Read Replicas in the cluster, you  can  then  reconnect  to  the
              reader endpoint.

          MultiAZ -> (boolean)

                     A value that specifies the order in which a Read  Replica
                     is  promoted  to  the primary instance after a failure of
                     the existing primary instance.

          VpcSecurityGroups -> (list)
              Provides a list of VPC security groups that the DB  cluster  be-
              longs to.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM  role  that  is
                     associated with the DB cluster.

                 Status -> (string)
                     Describes  the  state of association between the IAM role
                     and the DB cluster. The Status property  returns  one  of
                     the following values:

                     o ACTIVE  -  the  IAM  role ARN is associated with the DB
                       cluster and can be used to access other Amazon services
                       on your behalf.

                     o PENDING - the IAM role ARN is being associated with the
                       DB cluster.

                     o INVALID - the IAM role ARN is associated  with  the  DB
                       cluster, but the DB cluster is unable to assume the IAM
                       role in order to access other Amazon services  on  your
                       behalf.

                 FeatureName -> (string)
                     The  name of the feature associated with the Amazon Iden-
                     tity and Access Management (IAM) role. For  the  list  of

              to CloudWatch Logs.

              (string)

          PendingModifiedValues -> (structure)
              This data type is used as a response element  in  the  ModifyDB-
              Cluster operation and contains changes that will be applied dur-
              ing the next maintenance window.

              PendingCloudwatchLogsExports -> (structure)
                 This PendingCloudwatchLogsExports structure specifies pending
                 changes  to  which  CloudWatch logs are enabled and which are
                 disabled.

                 LogTypesToEnable -> (list)
                     Log types that are in the process of  being  deactivated.
                     After  they  are  deactivated, these log types aren't ex-
                     ported to CloudWatch Logs.

                     (string)

                 LogTypesToDisable -> (list)
                     Log types that are in the process of being enabled. After
                     they  are enabled, these log types are exported to Cloud-
                     Watch Logs.

                     (string)

              DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                 The DBClusterIdentifier value for the DB cluster.

              IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled -> (boolean)
                 A value that indicates whether mapping of Amazon Web Services
                 Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database ac-
                 counts is enabled.

                 The  allocated  storage  size in gibibytes (GiB) for database
                 engines. For Neptune, AllocatedStorage always returns 1,  be-
                 cause  Neptune  DB  cluster storage size isn't fixed, but in-
                 stead automatically adjusts as needed.

              Iops -> (integer)
                 The Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value.  This
                 setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          DeletionProtection -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether or not the DB cluster has deletion protection

              is enabled.

          CrossAccountClone -> (boolean)
              If set to true , the DB cluster can be cloned across accounts.

          AutomaticRestartTime -> (timestamp)
              Time at which the DB cluster will be automatically restarted.

          ServerlessV2ScalingConfiguration -> (structure)
              Shows  the  scaling  configuration  for  a Neptune Serverless DB
              cluster.

                 The  minimum number of Neptune capacity units (NCUs) for a DB
                 instance in a Neptune Serverless cluster. You can specify NCU
                 values in half-step increments, such as 8, 8.5, 9, and so on.

              MaxCapacity -> (double)
                 The  maximum number of Neptune capacity units (NCUs) for a DB
                 instance in a Neptune Serverless cluster. You can specify NCU
                 values  in half-step increments, such as 40, 40.5, 41, and so
                 on.
