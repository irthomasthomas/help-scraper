OPTIONS
       --identity-pool-id (string)
          An identity pool ID in the format REGION:GUID.

       --identity-pool-name (string)
          A string that you provide.

       --allow-unauthenticated-identities | --no-allow-unauthenticated-identi-
       ties (boolean)
          TRUE if the identity pool supports unauthenticated logins.

       --allow-classic-flow | --no-allow-classic-flow (boolean)
          Enables or disables the Basic  (Classic)  authentication  flow.  For
          more  information, see Identity Pools (Federated Identities) Authen-
          tication Flow in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

       --supported-login-providers (map)
          Optional key:value pairs mapping provider names to provider app IDs.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --developer-provider-name (string)
          The "domain" by which Cognito will refer to your users.

       --open-id-connect-provider-arns (list)
          The ARNs of the OpenID Connect providers.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cognito-identity-providers (list)
          A list representing an Amazon Cognito user pool and its client ID.

          (structure)
              A provider representing an Amazon  Cognito  user  pool  and  its
              client ID.

              ProviderName -> (string)
                 The  provider name for an Amazon Cognito user pool. For exam-
                 ple,  cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/us-east-1_123456789
                 .

              ClientId -> (string)
                 The client ID for the Amazon Cognito user pool.

              ServerSideTokenCheck -> (boolean)
                 TRUE if server-side token validation is enabled for the iden-
                 tity providers token.

                 Once you set ServerSideTokenCheck to  TRUE  for  an  identity
                 pool,  that identity pool will check with the integrated user
                 pools to make sure that the user has not been globally signed
                 out  or deleted before the identity pool provides an OIDC to-
                 ken or AWS credentials for the user.

                 If the user is signed out or deleted, the identity pool  will
                 return a 400 Not Authorized error.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ProviderName=string,ClientId=string,ServerSideTokenCheck=boolean ...

              "ServerSideTokenCheck": true|false
            }
            ...

          "string" "string" ...

       --identity-pool-tags (map)
          The tags that are assigned to the identity pool. A tag  is  a  label
          that  you  can apply to identity pools to categorize and manage them
          in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or  other
          criteria.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update an identity pool

       This  example updates an identity pool. It sets the name to MyIdentity-
       Pool. It adds Cognito as an identity provider.  It disallows  unauthen-
       ticated identities.

       Command:

          aws cognito-identity update-identity-pool --identity-pool-id "us-west-2:11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111" --identity-pool-name "MyIdentityPool" --no-allow-unauthenticated-identities --cognito-identity-providers ProviderName="cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/us-west-2_111111111",ClientId="3n4b5urk1ft4fl3mg5e62d9ado",ServerSideTokenCheck=false

       Output:

          {
            "IdentityPoolId": "us-west-2:11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
            "IdentityPoolName": "MyIdentityPool",
            "AllowUnauthenticatedIdentities": false,
            "CognitoIdentityProviders": [
                {
                    "ProviderName": "cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/us-west-2_111111111",
                    "ClientId": "3n4b5urk1ft4fl3mg5e62d9ado",
                    "ServerSideTokenCheck": false
                }
