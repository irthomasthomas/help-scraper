LOOKUP-DEVELOPER-IDENTITY()                        LOOKUP-DEVELOPER-IDENTITY()



NAME
       lookup-developer-identity -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  IdentityID associated with a DeveloperUserIdentifier or
       the list of DeveloperUserIdentifier values associated with  an  Identi-
       tyId  for an existing identity. Either IdentityID or DeveloperUserIden-
       tifier must not be null. If you supply only one of  these  values,  the
       other  value will be searched in the database and returned as a part of
       the response. If  you  supply  both,  DeveloperUserIdentifier  will  be
       matched  against  IdentityID  .  If the values are verified against the
       database, the response returns both values and is the same as  the  re-
       quest. Otherwise a ResourceConflictException is thrown.
          LookupDeveloperIdentity is intended for low-throughput control plane
          operations: for example, to enable customer  service  to  locate  an
          identity ID by username. If you are using it for higher-volume oper-
          ations such as user authentication, your requests are likely  to  be
          throttled.   GetOpenIdTokenForDeveloperIdentity  is  a better option
          for higher-volume operations for user authentication.

       You must use AWS Developer credentials to call this API.

OPTIONS
       --identity-pool-id (string)
          An identity pool ID in the format REGION:GUID.

       --identity-id (string)
          A unique identifier in the format REGION:GUID.

       --developer-user-identifier (string)
          A unique ID used by your backend authentication process to  identify
          a  user.  Typically,  a developer identity provider would issue many
          developer user identifiers, in keeping with the number of users.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of identities to return.

       --next-token (string)
          A pagination token. The first call you make will have NextToken  set
          to  null.  After  that  the  service will return NextToken values as
          needed. For example, let's say you make a  request  with  MaxResults
          set  to  10,  and  there are 20 matches in the database. The service
          will return a pagination token as a part of the response. This token
          can  be used to call the API again and get results starting from the
          11th match.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       IdentityId -> (string)
          A unique identifier in the format REGION:GUID.

       DeveloperUserIdentifierList -> (list)
          This is the list of developer user identifiers  associated  with  an
          identity  ID. Cognito supports the association of multiple developer
          user identifiers with an identity ID.

          (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          A pagination token. The first call you make will have NextToken  set
          to  null.  After  that  the  service will return NextToken values as
          needed. For example, let's say you make a  request  with  MaxResults
          set  to  10,  and  there are 20 matches in the database. The service
          will return a pagination token as a part of the response. This token
          can  be used to call the API again and get results starting from the
          11th match.
