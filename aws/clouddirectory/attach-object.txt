NAME
       attach-object -

DESCRIPTION
       Attaches  an  existing  object  to another object. An object can be ac-
       cessed in two ways:

       o Using the path

       o Using ObjectIdentifier

       See also: AWS API Documentation

OPTIONS
       --directory-arn (string)
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that is associated  with  the   Directory
          where both objects reside. For more information, see  arns .

       --parent-reference (structure)
          The parent object reference.

          Selector -> (string)
              A path selector supports easy selection of an object by the par-
              ent/child links leading to it from the directory root.  Use  the
              link  names  from  each parent/child link to construct the path.
              Path selectors start with a slash (/) and link names  are  sepa-
              rated  by  slashes. For more information about paths, see Access
              Objects . You can identify an object in  one  of  the  following
              ways:

              o $ObjectIdentifier  -  An object identifier is an opaque string
                provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating objects, the
                system will provide you with the identifier of the created ob-
                ject. An objects identifier is immutable and  no  two  objects
                will ever share the same object identifier. To identify an ob-
                ject  with  ObjectIdentifier,  the  ObjectIdentifier  must  be
                wrapped in double quotes.

              o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

              o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Selector=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Selector": "string"
          }

       --child-reference (structure)
          The child object reference to be attached to the object.

          Selector -> (string)
              A path selector supports easy selection of an object by the par-
              ent/child links leading to it from the directory root.  Use  the
              link  names  from  each parent/child link to construct the path.
              Path selectors start with a slash (/) and link names  are  sepa-
              rated  by  slashes. For more information about paths, see Access
              Objects . You can identify an object in  one  of  the  following
              ways:

              o $ObjectIdentifier  -  An object identifier is an opaque string
                provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating objects, the
                system will provide you with the identifier of the created ob-
                ject. An objects identifier is immutable and  no  two  objects
                will ever share the same object identifier. To identify an ob-
                ject  with  ObjectIdentifier,  the  ObjectIdentifier  must  be
                wrapped in double quotes.

              o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

              o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Selector=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Selector": "string"
          }

       --link-name (string)
          The link name with which the child object is attached to the parent.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

       AttachedObjectIdentifier -> (string)
          The attached ObjectIdentifier , which is the child  ObjectIdentifier
          .
