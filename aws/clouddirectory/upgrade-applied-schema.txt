UPGRADE-APPLIED-SCHEMA()                              UPGRADE-APPLIED-SCHEMA()



NAME
       upgrade-applied-schema -

DESCRIPTION
       Upgrades  a single directory in-place using the PublishedSchemaArn with
       schema updates found in MinorVersion . Backwards-compatible minor  ver-
       sion  upgrades are instantaneously available for readers on all objects
       in the directory. Note: This is a synchronous  API  call  and  upgrades
       only  one schema on a given directory per call. To upgrade multiple di-
       rectories from one schema, you would need to call this API on each  di-
       rectory.

OPTIONS
       --published-schema-arn (string)
          The revision of the published schema to upgrade the directory to.

       --directory-arn (string)
          The  ARN  for the directory to which the upgraded schema will be ap-
          plied.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Used for testing whether the major version schemas are backward com-
          patible or not. If schema compatibility fails, an exception would be
          thrown else the call would succeed but no  changes  will  be  saved.
          This parameter is optional.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       UpgradedSchemaArn -> (string)
          The  ARN  of the upgraded schema that is returned as part of the re-
          sponse.

       DirectoryArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the directory that is returned as part of the response.
