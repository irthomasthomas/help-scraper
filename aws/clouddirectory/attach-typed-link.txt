OPTIONS
       --directory-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the directory where  you  want  to
          attach the typed link.

       --source-object-reference (structure)
          Identifies the source object that the typed link will attach to.

          Selector -> (string)
              A path selector supports easy selection of an object by the par-
              ent/child links leading to it from the directory root.  Use  the
              link  names  from  each parent/child link to construct the path.
              Path selectors start with a slash (/) and link names  are  sepa-
              rated  by  slashes. For more information about paths, see Access
              Objects . You can identify an object in  one  of  the  following
              ways:

              o $ObjectIdentifier  -  An object identifier is an opaque string
                provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating objects, the
                system will provide you with the identifier of the created ob-
                ject. An objects identifier is immutable and  no  two  objects
                will ever share the same object identifier. To identify an ob-
                ject  with  ObjectIdentifier,  the  ObjectIdentifier  must  be
                wrapped in double quotes.

              o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

              o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Selector=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Selector": "string"
          }

       --target-object-reference (structure)
          Identifies the target object that the typed link will attach to.

          Selector -> (string)
              A path selector supports easy selection of an object by the par-
              ent/child links leading to it from the directory root.  Use  the

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

              Selector -> (string)
                 A  path  selector supports easy selection of an object by the
                 parent/child links leading to it from the directory root. Use
                 the  link  names from each parent/child link to construct the
                 path. Path selectors start with a slash (/)  and  link  names
                 are  separated  by slashes. For more information about paths,
                 see Access Objects . You can identify an object in one of the
                 following ways:

                 o $ObjectIdentifier  -  An  object  identifier  is  an opaque

                   the created object. An objects identifier is immutable  and
                   no  two objects will ever share the same object identifier.
                   To identify an object with ObjectIdentifier,  the  ObjectI-
                   dentifier must be wrapped in double quotes.

                 o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

              Identifies the target object that the typed link will attach to.
