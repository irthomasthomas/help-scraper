                 [All policy types] The valid target resource  types  and  ac-
                 tions a policy can manage. Specify EBS_SNAPSHOT_MANAGEMENT to
                 create a lifecycle policy that manages the lifecycle of  Ama-
                 zon EBS snapshots. Specify IMAGE_MANAGEMENT to create a life-
                 cycle policy that manages the lifecycle of  EBS-backed  AMIs.

                 [Snapshot  policies  only] The target resource type for snap-
                 shot and AMI lifecycle policies. Use VOLUME to  create  snap-
                 shots  of  individual  volumes  or  use  INSTANCE  to  create
                 multi-volume snapshots from the volumes for an instance.

                            for  snapshots  created  by  the policy. To create
                            snapshots in the same Region  as  the  source  re-
                            source, specify CLOUD . To create snapshots on the
                            same Outpost as the source resource, specify  OUT-
                            POST_LOCAL  . If you omit this parameter, CLOUD is
                            used by default.

                        If the policy targets resources in an Amazon Web  Ser-
                        vices  Region,  then  you must create snapshots in the
                        same Region as the source resource. If the policy tar-
                        gets  resources  on  an  Outpost,  then you can create
                        snapshots on the same Outpost as the source  resource,
                        or in the Region of that Outpost.

                     Interval -> (integer)
                        The  interval  between snapshots. The supported values
                        are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.

                     IntervalUnit -> (string)
                        The interval unit.

                     Times -> (list)
                        The time, in UTC, to start  the  operation.  The  sup-
                        ported format is hh:mm.

                        The  operation occurs within a one-hour window follow-
                        ing the specified time. If you do not specify a  time,
                        Amazon  Data  Lifecycle  Manager selects a time within
                        the next 24 hours.

                        (string)

                     CronExpression -> (string)
                        The schedule, as a Cron expression. The  schedule  in-
                        terval must be between 1 hour and 1 year. For more in-
                        formation, see Cron expressions in the  Amazon  Cloud-
                        Watch User Guide .

                     Scripts -> (list)
                            [Snapshot  policies  that  target  instances only]
                            Specifies pre and/or post scripts for  a  snapshot
                            lifecycle  policy  that targets instances. This is
                            useful for creating  application-consistent  snap-
                            shots,  or  for performing specific administrative
                            tasks before or after Amazon Data  Lifecycle  Man-
                            ager initiates snapshot creation.

                        sistent snapshots with pre and post scripts .

                        (structure)
                               [Snapshot policies that target instances  only]
                               Information about pre and/or post scripts for a
                               snapshot  lifecycle  policy  that  targets  in-
                               stances.  For  more information, see Automating
                               application-consistent snapshots with  pre  and
                               post scripts .

                            Stages -> (list)
                               Indicate  which  scripts  Amazon Data Lifecycle
                               Manager should run  on  target  instances.  Pre
                               scripts  run  before Amazon Data Lifecycle Man-
                               ager initiates snapshot creation. Post  scripts
                               run  after Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager initi-
                               ates snapshot creation.

                               o To run a pre script only, specify  PRE  .  In
                                 this  case,  Amazon  Data  Lifecycle  Manager
                                 calls the SSM document  with  the  pre-script
                                 parameter  before  initiating  snapshot  cre-
                                 ation.

                               o To run a post script only, specify POST .  In
                                 this  case,  Amazon  Data  Lifecycle  Manager
                                 calls the SSM document with  the  post-script
                                 parameter after initiating snapshot creation.

                               o To  run  both  pre  and post scripts, specify
                                 both PRE and POST . In this case, Amazon Data
                                 Lifecycle Manager calls the SSM document with
                                 the pre-script  parameter  before  initiating
                                 snapshot  creation, and then it calls the SSM
                                 document again with the post-script parameter
                                 after initiating snapshot creation.

                               If  you  are  automating VSS Backups, omit this
                               parameter.

                               Default: PRE and POST

                               (string)

                            ExecutionHandlerService -> (string)
                               Indicates the service used to execute  the  pre
                               and/or post scripts.

                               o If  you are using custom SSM documents, spec-
                                 ify AWS_SYSTEMS_MANAGER .

                               o If you are automating VSS Backups, omit  this
                                 parameter.

                               Default: AWS_SYSTEMS_MANAGER

                            ExecutionHandler -> (string)
                               The  SSM  document that includes the pre and/or
                               post scripts to run.

                               o If you are automating  VSS  backups,  specify
                                 AWS_VSS_BACKUP  .  In  this case, Amazon Data
                                 Lifecycle  Manager  automatically  uses   the
                                 AWSEC2-CreateVssSnapshot SSM document.

                               o If  you  are using a custom SSM document that
                                 you own, specify either the name  or  ARN  of
                                 the  SSM  document. If you are using a custom
                                 SSM document that is shared with you, specify
                                 the ARN of the SSM document.

                            ExecuteOperationOnScriptFailure -> (boolean)
                               Indicates whether Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager
                               should default to crash-consistent snapshots if
                               the pre script fails.

                               o To  default  to  crash consistent snapshot if
                                 the pre script fails, specify true .

                               o To skip the instance for snapshot creation if
                                 the pre script fails, specify false .

                               This  parameter  is supported only if you run a
                               pre script. If you run a post script only, omit
                               this parameter.

                               Default: true

                            ExecutionTimeout -> (integer)
                               Specifies  a  timeout period, in seconds, after
                               which Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager  fails  the
                               script  run attempt if it has not completed. If
                               a script does not complete within  its  timeout
                               period, Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager fails the
                               attempt. The timeout period applies to the  pre
                               and post scripts individually.

                               If  you  are  automating VSS Backups, omit this
                               parameter.

                               Default: 10

                            MaximumRetryCount -> (integer)
                               Specifies the number of times Amazon Data Life-
                               cycle Manager should retry scripts that fail.

                               o If  the pre script fails, Amazon Data Lifecy-
                                 cle Manager retries the entire snapshot  cre-
                                 ation  process, including running the pre and
                                 post scripts.

                               o If the post script fails, Amazon Data Lifecy-
                                 cle  Manager retries the post script only; in
                                 this case, the pre script will have completed
                                 and the snapshot might have been created.

                               If  you  do not want Amazon Data Lifecycle Man-
                               ager to retry failed scripts, specify 0 .

                               Default: 0

                 RetainRule -> (structure)
                     The retention rule for snapshots or AMIs created  by  the
                     policy.

                     Count -> (integer)
                        The  number of snapshots to retain for each volume, up
                        to a maximum of 1000. For example if you want  to  re-
                        tain  a  maximum  of three snapshots, specify 3 . When
                        the fourth snapshot is created,  the  oldest  retained
                        snapshot  is  deleted,  or  it is moved to the archive
                        tier if you have specified an ArchiveRule .

                     Interval -> (integer)
                        The amount of time to retain each snapshot. The  maxi-
                        mum  is  100 years. This is equivalent to 1200 months,
                        5200 weeks, or 36500 days.

                     IntervalUnit -> (string)
                        The unit of time for time-based retention.  For  exam-
                        ple,  to retain snapshots for 3 months, specify Inter-
                        val=3 and IntervalUnit=MONTHS . Once the snapshot  has
                        been  retained  for  3 months, it is deleted, or it is
                        moved to the archive tier if  you  have  specified  an
                        ArchiveRule .

                 FastRestoreRule -> (structure)
                        [Snapshot  policies  only]  The rule for enabling fast
                        snapshot restore.

                        shot restore.

                     Interval -> (integer)
                        The  amount  of  time to enable fast snapshot restore.
                        The maximum is 100 years. This is equivalent  to  1200
                        months, 5200 weeks, or 36500 days.

                     IntervalUnit -> (string)
                        The unit of time for enabling fast snapshot restore.

                     AvailabilityZones -> (list)
                        The  Availability  Zones in which to enable fast snap-
                        shot restore.

                        (string)

                 CrossRegionCopyRules -> (list)
                     Specifies a rule for copying snapshots or AMIs across re-
                     gions.

                     NOTE:
                        You can't specify cross-Region copy rules for policies
                        that create snapshots on an  Outpost.  If  the  policy
                        creates  snapshots  in a Region, then snapshots can be
                        copied to up to three Regions or Outposts.

                     (structure)
                            [Snapshot  and  AMI  policies  only]  Specifies  a
                            cross-Region  copy  rule  for  a  snapshot and AMI
                            policies.

                        NOTE:
                            To  specify  a  cross-Region   copy   action   for
                            event-based polices, use CrossRegionCopyAction .

                        TargetRegion -> (string)

                            NOTE:
                                   Use  this  parameter for AMI policies only.
                                   For snapshot policies, use Target  instead.
                                   For  snapshot  policies  created before the
                                   Target parameter was introduced,  this  pa-
                                   rameter  indicates  the  target  Region for
                                   snapshot copies.

                               [AMI policies only] The target  Region  or  the
                               Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the target Out-
                               post for the snapshot copies.

                        Target -> (string)

                            NOTE:
                                   Use this parameter  for  snapshot  policies
                                   only.  For  AMI  policies, use TargetRegion
                                   instead.

                               [Snapshot policies only] The target  Region  or
                               the  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the target
                               Outpost for the snapshot copies.

                        Encrypted -> (boolean)
                            To encrypt a copy of an  unencrypted  snapshot  if
                            encryption  by  default is not enabled, enable en-
                            cryption using this parameter. Copies of encrypted
                            snapshots are encrypted, even if this parameter is
                            false or if encryption by default is not enabled.

                        CmkArn -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS  key  to
                            use  for  EBS encryption. If this parameter is not
                            specified, the default KMS key for the account  is
                            used.

                        CopyTags -> (boolean)
                            Indicates  whether  to  copy all user-defined tags
                            from the source snapshot or AMI to  the  cross-Re-
                            gion copy.

                        RetainRule -> (structure)
                            The  retention  rule  that  indicates how long the
                            cross-Region snapshot or AMI copies are to be  re-
                            tained in the destination Region.

                            Interval -> (integer)
                               The  amount  of  time  to retain a cross-Region
                               snapshot or AMI copy. The maximum is 100 years.
                               This  is equivalent to 1200 months, 5200 weeks,
                               or 36500 days.

                            IntervalUnit -> (string)
                               The unit of time for time-based retention.  For
                               example,  to  retain  a cross-Region copy for 3
                               months,  specify  Interval=3   and   IntervalU-
                               nit=MONTHS .

                               rule.

                            Interval -> (integer)
                               The   period   after  which  to  deprecate  the
                               cross-Region AMI copies.  The  period  must  be
                               less than or equal to the cross-Region AMI copy
                               retention period, and it can't be greater  than
                               10 years. This is equivalent to 120 months, 520
                               weeks, or 3650 days.

                               val  . For example, to deprecate a cross-Region
                               AMI copy after 3 months, specify Interval=3 and
                               IntervalUnit=MONTHS .

                 ShareRules -> (list)
                        [Snapshot  policies  only]  The rule for sharing snap-
                        shots with other Amazon Web Services accounts.

                        schedule.

                     Count -> (integer)
                        If the schedule has a count-based retention rule, this
                        parameter specifies the number of oldest AMIs to  dep-
                        recate.  The  count  must be less than or equal to the

                     Interval -> (integer)
                        If  the schedule has an age-based retention rule, this
                        parameter specifies the period after which  to  depre-
                        cate  AMIs created by the schedule. The period must be
                        less than or equal to the schedule's retention period,
                        and it can't be greater than 10 years. This is equiva-
                        lent to 120 months, 520 weeks, or 3650 days.

                     IntervalUnit -> (string)
                        The unit of time in which to measure the Interval .

                 ArchiveRule -> (structure)

                        shot archiving rule for the schedule. When you specify
                        an archiving rule, snapshots are  automatically  moved
                        from  the  standard  tier to the archive tier once the
                        schedule's retention threshold is met.  Snapshots  are
                        then  retained in the archive tier for the archive re-
                        tention period that you specify.

                     For more information about using snapshot archiving,  see
                     Considerations for snapshot lifecycle policies .

                     RetainRule -> (structure)
                        Information  about  the retention period for the snap-
                        shot archiving rule.

                        RetentionArchiveTier -> (structure)
                            Information about retention period in  the  Amazon
                            EBS  Snapshots  Archive. For more information, see
                            Archive Amazon EBS snapshots .

                            Count -> (integer)
                               The maximum number of snapshots  to  retain  in
                               the  archive  storage tier for each volume. The
                               count must ensure that each snapshot remains in
                               the  archive tier for at least 90 days. For ex-
                               ample, if the schedule creates snapshots  every
                               30  days, you must specify a count of 3 or more
                               to ensure that each snapshot is archived for at
                               least 90 days.

                            Interval -> (integer)
                               Specifies  the  period  of time to retain snap-
                               shots in the archive tier.  After  this  period
                               expires, the snapshot is permanently deleted.

                            IntervalUnit -> (string)
                               The unit of time in which to measure the Inter-
                               val . For example, to retain a snapshots in the
                               archive  tier  for 6 months, specify Interval=6
                               and IntervalUnit=MONTHS .

          Parameters -> (structure)
                 [Snapshot and AMI policies only] A set of optional parameters
                 for snapshot and AMI lifecycle policies.

              NOTE:
                 If  you are modifying a policy that was created or previously
                 modified using the Amazon  Data  Lifecycle  Manager  console,
                 then  you  must include this parameter and specify either the
                 default values or the new values that you require. You  can't
                 omit this parameter or set its values to null.

              ExcludeBootVolume -> (boolean)
                 [Snapshot  policies  that  target  instances  only] Indicates
                 whether to exclude the root volume from multi-volume snapshot
                 sets.  The  default is false . If you specify true , then the
                 root volumes attached to targeted instances will be  excluded
                 from the multi-volume snapshot sets created by the policy.

              NoReboot -> (boolean)
                 [AMI  policies only] Indicates whether targeted instances are
                 rebooted when the lifecycle policy runs. true indicates  that
                 targeted  instances  are  not  rebooted when the policy runs.
                 false indicates that target instances are rebooted  when  the
                 policy  runs.  The  default  is  true  (instances are not re-
                 booted).

              ExcludeDataVolumeTags -> (list)
                     [Snapshot policies that target instances only]  The  tags
                     used  to identify data (non-root) volumes to exclude from
                     multi-volume snapshot sets.

                 If you create a snapshot lifecycle policy  that  targets  in-
                 stances  and  you  specify tags for this parameter, then data
                 volumes with the specified tags that are attached to targeted
                 instances  will  be  excluded  from the multi-volume snapshot
                 sets created by the policy.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies a tag for a resource.

                     Key -> (string)

          EventSource -> (structure)
                 [Event-based policies only]  The  event  that  activates  the
                 event-based policy.

              Type -> (string)
                 The  source  of  the event. Currently only managed CloudWatch
                 Events rules are supported.

              Parameters -> (structure)
                 Information about the event.

                 EventType -> (string)
                     The type  of  event.  Currently,  only  snapshot  sharing
                     events are supported.

                 SnapshotOwner -> (list)
                     The  IDs  of  the  Amazon  Web Services accounts that can
                     trigger policy by sharing snapshots  with  your  account.
                     The  policy  only runs if one of the specified Amazon Web
                     Services accounts shares a snapshot with your account.

                     (string)

                 DescriptionRegex -> (string)
                     The snapshot description that can trigger the policy. The
                     description  pattern is specified using a regular expres-
                     sion. The policy runs only if a snapshot with a  descrip-
                     tion  that  matches  the specified pattern is shared with
                     your account.

                     For  example,  specifying  ^.*Created  for  policy:  pol-
                     icy-1234567890abcdef0.*$  configures  the  policy  to run
                     only   if    snapshots    created    by    policy    pol-
                     icy-1234567890abcdef0 are shared with your account.

          Actions -> (list)
                 [Event-based  policies only] The actions to be performed when
                 the event-based policy is activated. You can specify only one
                 action per policy.

              (structure)
                     [Event-based  policies  only]  Specifies an action for an
                     event-based policy.

                 Name -> (string)
                     A descriptive name for the action.

                 CrossRegionCopy -> (list)
                     The rule for copying shared snapshots across Regions.

                     (structure)
                            [Event-based policies only] Specifies a  cross-Re-
                            gion copy action for event-based policies.

                        NOTE:
                            To  specify  a cross-Region copy rule for snapshot
                            and AMI policies, use CrossRegionCopyRule .

                        Target -> (string)
                            The target Region.

                        EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The encryption settings for the copied snapshot.

                            Encrypted -> (boolean)
                               To encrypt a copy of  an  unencrypted  snapshot
                               when  encryption by default is not enabled, en-
                               able encryption using this parameter. Copies of
                               encrypted snapshots are encrypted, even if this
                               parameter is false or when  encryption  by  de-
                               fault is not enabled.

                            CmkArn -> (string)
                               The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key
                               to use for EBS encryption. If this parameter is
                               not  specified, the default KMS key for the ac-
                               count is used.

                        RetainRule -> (structure)
                            Specifies a retention rule for cross-Region  snap-
                            shot  copies  created  by  snapshot or event-based
                            policies, or cross-Region AMI  copies  created  by
                            AMI  policies. After the retention period expires,
                            the cross-Region copy is deleted.

                            Interval -> (integer)
                               The amount of time  to  retain  a  cross-Region
                               snapshot or AMI copy. The maximum is 100 years.
                               This is equivalent to 1200 months, 5200  weeks,
                               or 36500 days.

                            IntervalUnit -> (string)
                               The  unit of time for time-based retention. For
                               example, to retain a cross-Region  copy  for  3
                               months,   specify   Interval=3  and  IntervalU-
                               nit=MONTHS .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
