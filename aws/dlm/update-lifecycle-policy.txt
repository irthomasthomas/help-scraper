                 [All  policy  types]  The valid target resource types and ac-
                 tions a policy can manage. Specify EBS_SNAPSHOT_MANAGEMENT to
                 create  a lifecycle policy that manages the lifecycle of Ama-
                 zon EBS snapshots. Specify IMAGE_MANAGEMENT to create a life-
                 cycle  policy  that manages the lifecycle of EBS-backed AMIs.
                 Specify EVENT_BASED_POLICY to create  an  event-based  policy
                 that performs specific actions when a defined event occurs in
                 your Amazon Web Services account.

                            for snapshots created by  the  policy.  To  create
                            snapshots  in  the  same  Region as the source re-
                            source, specify CLOUD . To create snapshots on the
                            same  Outpost as the source resource, specify OUT-
                            POST_LOCAL . If you omit this parameter, CLOUD  is
                            used by default.

                        If  the policy targets resources in an Amazon Web Ser-
                        vices Region, then you must create  snapshots  in  the
                        same Region as the source resource. If the policy tar-
                        gets resources on an  Outpost,  then  you  can  create
                        snapshots  on the same Outpost as the source resource,
                        or in the Region of that Outpost.

                        ported format is hh:mm.

                        The operation occurs within a one-hour window  follow-
                        ing  the specified time. If you do not specify a time,
                        Amazon DLM selects a time within the next 24 hours.

                        to a maximum of 1000.

                     Interval -> (integer)
                        The  amount of time to retain each snapshot. The maxi-
                        mum is 100 years. This is equivalent to  1200  months,
                        5200 weeks, or 36500 days.

                     IntervalUnit -> (string)

                     Interval -> (integer)
                        The  amount  of  time to enable fast snapshot restore.
                        The maximum is 100 years. This is equivalent  to  1200
                        months, 5200 weeks, or 36500 days.

                     IntervalUnit -> (string)

                        You can't specify cross-Region copy rules for policies
                        that create snapshots on an  Outpost.  If  the  policy
                        creates  snapshots  in a Region, then snapshots can be
                        copied to up to three Regions or Outposts.

                     (structure)
                            [Snapshot  and  AMI  policies  only]  Specifies  a
                            cross-Region  copy rule for snapshot and AMI poli-
                            cies.

                        NOTE:
                            To  specify  a  cross-Region   copy   action   for
                            event-based polices, use  CrossRegionCopyAction .

                        TargetRegion -> (string)

                            NOTE:
                               Avoid  using  this  parameter when creating new
                               policies. Instead, use Target to specify a tar-
                               get  Region  or  a  target Outpost for snapshot
                               copies.

                               For policies created before the Target  parame-
                               ter  was  introduced,  this parameter indicates
                               the target Region for snapshot copies.

                        Target -> (string)
                            The target Region  or  the  Amazon  Resource  Name
                            (ARN)  of  the  target  Outpost  for  the snapshot
                            copies.

                            Use this parameter instead of  TargetRegion  .  Do
                            not specify both.

                        Encrypted -> (boolean)
                            To  encrypt  a  copy of an unencrypted snapshot if
                            encryption by default is not enabled,  enable  en-
                            cryption using this parameter. Copies of encrypted
                            snapshots are encrypted, even if this parameter is
                            false or if encryption by default is not enabled.

                        CmkArn -> (string)
                            The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key to
                            use for EBS encryption. If this parameter  is  not
                            specified,  the default KMS key for the account is
                            used.

                        CopyTags -> (boolean)
                            Indicates whether to copy  all  user-defined  tags
                            from  the  source snapshot or AMI to the cross-Re-

                               The  unit of time for time-based retention. For
                               example, to retain a cross-Region  copy  for  3
                               months,   specify   Interval=3  and  IntervalU-
                               nit=MONTHS .

                               cross-Region  AMI  copies.  The  period must be
                               less than or equal to the cross-Region AMI copy
                               retention  period, and it can't be greater than
                               10 years. This is equivalent to 120 months, 520
                               weeks, or 3650 days.

                            IntervalUnit -> (string)

                            The unit of time for the automatic  unsharing  in-
                            terval.

                 DeprecateRule -> (structure)
                        [AMI  policies  only] The AMI deprecation rule for the
                        schedule.

                     Count -> (integer)
                        If the schedule has a count-based retention rule, this
                        parameter  specifies the number of oldest AMIs to dep-
                        recate. The count must be less than or  equal  to  the
                        schedule's  retention  count,  and it can't be greater
                        than 1000.

                     Interval -> (integer)
                        If the schedule has an age-based retention rule,  this
                        parameter  specifies  the period after which to depre-
                        cate AMIs created by the schedule. The period must  be
                        less than or equal to the schedule's retention period,
                        and it can't be greater than 10 years. This is equiva-
                        lent to 120 months, 520 weeks, or 3650 days.

                     IntervalUnit -> (string)
                        The unit of time in which to measure the Interval .

          Parameters -> (structure)
                 [Snapshot and AMI policies only] A set of optional parameters
                 for snapshot and AMI lifecycle policies.

              NOTE:
                 If you are modifying a policy that was created or  previously
                 modified  using  the  Amazon  Data Lifecycle Manager console,
                 then you must include this parameter and specify  either  the
                 default  values or the new values that you require. You can't
                 omit this parameter or set its values to null.

              ExcludeBootVolume -> (boolean)
                 [Snapshot policies  that  target  instances  only]  Indicates
                 whether to exclude the root volume from multi-volume snapshot
                 sets. The default is false . If you specify true ,  then  the
                 root  volumes attached to targeted instances will be excluded
                 from the multi-volume snapshot sets created by the policy.

              NoReboot -> (boolean)
                 [AMI policies only] Indicates whether targeted instances  are
                 rebooted  when the lifecycle policy runs. true indicates that
                 targeted instances are not rebooted  when  the  policy  runs.
                 false  indicates  that target instances are rebooted when the
                 policy runs. The default  is  true  (instances  are  not  re-
                 booted).

              ExcludeDataVolumeTags -> (list)
                     [Snapshot  policies  that target instances only] The tags
                     used to identify data (non-root) volumes to exclude  from
                     multi-volume snapshot sets.

                 If  you  create  a snapshot lifecycle policy that targets in-
                 stances and you specify tags for this  parameter,  then  data
                 volumes with the specified tags that are attached to targeted
                 instances will be excluded  from  the  multi-volume  snapshot
                 sets created by the policy.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies a tag for a resource.

                     Key -> (string)

                     Value -> (string)
                        The tag value.

          EventSource -> (structure)
                 [Event-based  policies  only]  The  event  that activates the
                 event-based policy.

              Type -> (string)
                 The source of the event. Currently  only  managed  CloudWatch
                 Events rules are supported.

              Parameters -> (structure)
                 Information about the event.

                 EventType -> (string)
                     The  type  of  event.  Currently,  only  snapshot sharing
                     events are supported.

                 SnapshotOwner -> (list)
                     The IDs of the Amazon  Web  Services  accounts  that  can
                     trigger  policy  by  sharing snapshots with your account.
                     The policy only runs if one of the specified  Amazon  Web
                     Services accounts shares a snapshot with your account.

                     (string)

                 DescriptionRegex -> (string)

                     description pattern is specified using a regular  expres-
                     sion.  The policy runs only if a snapshot with a descrip-
                     tion that matches the specified pattern  is  shared  with
                     your account.

                     For  example,  specifying  ^.*Created  for  policy:  pol-
                     icy-1234567890abcdef0.*$ configures  the  policy  to  run
                     only    if    snapshots    created    by    policy   pol-
                     icy-1234567890abcdef0 are shared with your account.

          Actions -> (list)
                 [Event-based policies only] The actions to be performed  when
                 the event-based policy is activated. You can specify only one
                 action per policy.

              (structure)
                     [Event-based policies only] Specifies an  action  for  an
                     event-based policy.

                            [Event-based  policies only] Specifies a cross-Re-
                            gion copy action for event-based policies.

                        NOTE:
                            To specify a cross-Region copy rule  for  snapshot
                            and AMI policies, use  CrossRegionCopyRule .

                        Target -> (string)
                            The target Region.

                        EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The encryption settings for the copied snapshot.

                            Encrypted -> (boolean)
                               To  encrypt  a  copy of an unencrypted snapshot
                               when encryption by default is not enabled,  en-
                               able encryption using this parameter. Copies of
                               encrypted snapshots are encrypted, even if this
                               parameter  is  false  or when encryption by de-
                               fault is not enabled.

                            CmkArn -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  KMS  key
                               to use for EBS encryption. If this parameter is
                               not specified, the default KMS key for the  ac-
                               count is used.

                        RetainRule -> (structure)
                            Specifies  a retention rule for cross-Region snap-
                            shot copies created  by  snapshot  or  event-based
                            policies,  or  cross-Region  AMI copies created by
                            AMI policies. After the retention period  expires,
                            the cross-Region copy is deleted.

                            Interval -> (integer)
                               The  amount  of  time  to retain a cross-Region
                               snapshot or AMI copy. The maximum is 100 years.

                               or 36500 days.

                            IntervalUnit -> (string)
                               The unit of time for time-based retention.  For
                               example,  to  retain  a cross-Region copy for 3
                               months,  specify  Interval=3   and   IntervalU-
                               nit=MONTHS .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
