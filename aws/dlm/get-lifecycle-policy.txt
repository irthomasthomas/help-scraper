SYNOPSIS
            get-lifecycle-policy
          --policy-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-id (string)
          The identifier of the lifecycle policy.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                               icy. To create snapshots in the same Region  as
                               the  source resource, specify CLOUD . To create
                               snapshots on the same Outpost as the source re-
                               source,  specify  OUTPOST_LOCAL  .  If you omit
                               this parameter, CLOUD is used by default.

                            If the policy targets resources in an  Amazon  Web

                            the same Region as the  source  resource.  If  the
                            policy  targets  resources on an Outpost, then you
                            can create snapshots on the same  Outpost  as  the
                            source resource, or in the Region of that Outpost.

                        Interval -> (integer)

                            ues are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.

                        IntervalUnit -> (string)
                            The interval unit.

                        Times -> (list)
                            The time, in UTC, to start the operation. The sup-
                            ported format is hh:mm.

                            The operation occurs within a one-hour window fol-
                            lowing the specified time. If you do not specify a
                            time, Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager selects a time
                            within the next 24 hours.

                            (string)

                                   cle Manager  initiates  snapshot  creation.
                                   Post  scripts run after Amazon Data Lifecy-
                                   cle Manager initiates snapshot creation.

                                   o To run a pre script only, specify  PRE  .
                                     In  this case, Amazon Data Lifecycle Man-
                                     ager calls  the  SSM  document  with  the
                                     pre-script  parameter  before  initiating
                                     snapshot creation.

                                   o To run a post script only, specify POST .
                                     In  this case, Amazon Data Lifecycle Man-
                                     ager calls  the  SSM  document  with  the
                                     post-script  parameter  after  initiating
                                     snapshot creation.

                                   o To run both pre and post scripts, specify
                                     both  PRE and POST . In this case, Amazon
                                     Data Lifecycle Manager calls the SSM doc-
                                     ument  with  the pre-script parameter be-
                                     fore initiating  snapshot  creation,  and
                                     then it calls the SSM document again with
                                     the post-script parameter after  initiat-
                                     ing snapshot creation.

                                   If  you  are  automating  VSS Backups, omit
                                   this parameter.

                                   Default: PRE and POST

                               ExecutionHandlerService -> (string)
                                   Indicates the service used to  execute  the
                                   pre and/or post scripts.

                                   o If  you are using custom SSM documents or
                                     automating  application-consistent  snap-
                                     shots  of  SAP  HANA  workloads,  specify
                                     AWS_SYSTEMS_MANAGER .

                                   o If you are automating VSS  Backups,  omit
                                     this parameter.

                                   Default: AWS_SYSTEMS_MANAGER

                               ExecutionHandler -> (string)
                                   The  SSM  document  that  includes  the pre
                                   and/or post scripts to run.

                                   o If you are automating VSS backups,  spec-
                                     ify AWS_VSS_BACKUP . In this case, Amazon
                                     Data Lifecycle Manager automatically uses
                                     the  AWSEC2-CreateVssSnapshot  SSM  docu-
                                     ment.

                                   o If you are automating application-consis-
                                     tent  snapshots  for  SAP HANA workloads,
                                     specify   AWSSystemsManagerSAP-CreateDLM-
                                     SnapshotForSAPHANA .

                                   o If  you  are  using a custom SSM document
                                     that you own, specify either the name  or
                                     ARN of the SSM document. If you are using
                                     a custom SSM document that is shared with
                                     you, specify the ARN of the SSM document.

                               ExecuteOperationOnScriptFailure -> (boolean)
                                   Indicates  whether  Amazon  Data  Lifecycle
                                   Manager should default to  crash-consistent
                                   snapshots if the pre script fails.

                                   o To  default  to crash consistent snapshot
                                     if the pre script fails, specify true .

                                   o To skip the instance  for  snapshot  cre-
                                     ation  if  the  pre script fails, specify
                                     false .

                                   This parameter is supported only if you run
                                   a  pre  script.  If  you  run a post script
                                   only, omit this parameter.

                                   Default: true

                               ExecutionTimeout -> (integer)
                                   Specifies a timeout period, in seconds, af-
                                   ter  which  Amazon  Data  Lifecycle Manager
                                   fails the script run attempt if it has  not
                                   completed.  If  a  script does not complete
                                   within  its  timeout  period,  Amazon  Data
                                   Lifecycle  Manager  fails  the attempt. The
                                   timeout period applies to the pre and  post
                                   scripts individually.

                                   If  you  are  automating  VSS Backups, omit
                                   this parameter.

                                   Default: 10

                               MaximumRetryCount -> (integer)
                                   Specifies the number of times  Amazon  Data
                                   Lifecycle Manager should retry scripts that
                                   fail.

                                   o If the  pre  script  fails,  Amazon  Data
                                     Lifecycle   Manager  retries  the  entire
                                     snapshot creation process, including run-
                                     ning the pre and post scripts.

                                   o If  the  post  script  fails, Amazon Data
                                     Lifecycle Manager retries the post script
                                     only;  in  this case, the pre script will
                                     have completed  and  the  snapshot  might
                                     have been created.

                                   If  you  do  not want Amazon Data Lifecycle
                                   Manager to retry failed scripts, specify  0
                                   .

                                   Default: 0

                     RetainRule -> (structure)
                        The  retention  rule  for snapshots or AMIs created by
                        the policy.

                        Count -> (integer)
                            The number of snapshots to retain for each volume,
                            up  to  a maximum of 1000. For example if you want
                            to retain a maximum of three snapshots, specify  3
                            .  When the fourth snapshot is created, the oldest
                            retained snapshot is deleted, or it  is  moved  to
                            the   archive   tier  if  you  have  specified  an
                            ArchiveRule .

                        Interval -> (integer)
                            The amount of time to retain  each  snapshot.  The
                            maximum  is  100 years. This is equivalent to 1200
                            months, 5200 weeks, or 36500 days.

                        IntervalUnit -> (string)
                            The unit of time for time-based retention. For ex-
                            ample,  to  retain snapshots for 3 months, specify
                            Interval=3  and  IntervalUnit=MONTHS  .  Once  the
                            snapshot  has  been  retained  for 3 months, it is
                            deleted, or it is moved to the archive tier if you
                            have specified an ArchiveRule .

                     FastRestoreRule -> (structure)
                            [Custom  snapshot  policies only] The rule for en-
                            abling fast snapshot restore.

                        Count -> (integer)
                            The number of snapshots to be  enabled  with  fast
                            snapshot restore.

                        Interval -> (integer)
                            The  amount  of  time  to enable fast snapshot re-
                            store. The maximum is 100 years. This  is  equiva-
                            lent to 1200 months, 5200 weeks, or 36500 days.

                        IntervalUnit -> (string)
                            The  unit  of  time for enabling fast snapshot re-
                            store.

                        AvailabilityZones -> (list)
                            The Availability Zones in  which  to  enable  fast
                            snapshot restore.

                            (string)

                     CrossRegionCopyRules -> (list)
                        Specifies  a rule for copying snapshots or AMIs across
                        regions.

                        NOTE:
                            You can't  specify  cross-Region  copy  rules  for
                            policies  that  create snapshots on an Outpost. If
                            the policy creates snapshots  in  a  Region,  then
                            snapshots  can be copied to up to three Regions or
                            Outposts.

                        (structure)
                               [Custom snapshot and AMI policies only]  Speci-

                               and AMI policies.

                            NOTE:
                               To  specify  a  cross-Region  copy  action  for
                               event-based  polices, use CrossRegionCopyAction
                               .

                            TargetRegion -> (string)

                               NOTE:
                                      Use  this  parameter  for  AMI  policies
                                      only.  For snapshot policies, use Target
                                      instead. For snapshot  policies  created
                                      before  the  Target parameter was intro-
                                      duced, this parameter indicates the tar-
                                      get Region for snapshot copies.

                                   [Custom  AMI  policies only] The target Re-
                                   gion or the Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of
                                   the target Outpost for the snapshot copies.

                            Target -> (string)

                               NOTE:
                                      Use this parameter for snapshot policies
                                      only. For AMI policies, use TargetRegion
                                      instead.

                                   [Custom  snapshot policies only] The target
                                   Region or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of

                            Encrypted -> (boolean)
                               To encrypt a copy of an unencrypted snapshot if
                               encryption by default is  not  enabled,  enable
                               encryption  using this parameter. Copies of en-
                               crypted snapshots are encrypted, even  if  this
                               parameter  is false or if encryption by default
                               is not enabled.

                            CmkArn -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  KMS  key
                               to use for EBS encryption. If this parameter is
                               not specified, the default KMS key for the  ac-
                               count is used.

                            CopyTags -> (boolean)

                            RetainRule -> (structure)
                               The  retention rule that indicates how long the
                               cross-Region snapshot or AMI copies are  to  be
                               retained in the destination Region.

                                   copy retention  period,  and  it  can't  be
                                   greater  than  10 years. This is equivalent
                                   to 120 months, 520 weeks, or 3650 days.

                            [Custom  snapshot  policies  that  target  volumes
                            only] The snapshot archiving rule for  the  sched-
                            ule. When you specify an archiving rule, snapshots
                            are automatically moved from the standard tier  to
                            the  archive  tier  once  the schedule's retention
                            threshold is met. Snapshots are then  retained  in
                            the  archive tier for the archive retention period
                            that you specify.

                                   in  the  archive storage tier for each vol-
                                   ume. The count must ensure that each  snap-
                                   shot  remains  in  the  archive tier for at
                                   least 90 days. For example, if the schedule
                                   creates  snapshots  every 30 days, you must
                                   specify a count of 3 or more to ensure that
                                   each  snapshot  is archived for at least 90
                                   days.

                                   Interval . For example, to retain  a  snap-
                                   shots  in  the  archive  tier for 6 months,
                                   specify Interval=6 and  IntervalUnit=MONTHS
                                   .

              Parameters -> (structure)
                     [Custom snapshot and AMI policies only] A set of optional
                     parameters for snapshot and AMI lifecycle policies.

                     If you are modifying a policy that was created or  previ-
                     ously  modified  using  the Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager
                     console, then you must include this parameter and specify
                     either  the default values or the new values that you re-
                     quire. You can't omit this parameter or set its values to
                     null.

                     [Custom snapshot policies that target instances only] In-
                     dicates  whether  to  exclude  the   root   volume   from
                     multi-volume snapshot sets. The default is false . If you
                     specify true , then the root volumes attached to targeted
                     instances will be excluded from the multi-volume snapshot
                     sets created by the policy.

                 NoReboot -> (boolean)
                     [Custom AMI policies only] Indicates whether targeted in-
                     stances are rebooted when the lifecycle policy runs. true
                     indicates that targeted instances are not  rebooted  when
                     the  policy  runs.  false indicates that target instances
                     are rebooted when the policy runs. The  default  is  true
                     (instances are not rebooted).

                 ExcludeDataVolumeTags -> (list)
                        [Custom  snapshot policies that target instances only]

                        exclude from multi-volume snapshot sets.

                     If  you  create  a snapshot lifecycle policy that targets
                     instances and you specify tags for this  parameter,  then
                     data volumes with the specified tags that are attached to
                     targeted instances will be excluded from the multi-volume
                     snapshot sets created by the policy.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies a tag for a resource.

                        The  description  pattern is specified using a regular
                        expression. The policy runs only if a snapshot with  a
                        description  that  matches  the  specified  pattern is
                        shared with your account.

                        For example, specifying ^.*Created  for  policy:  pol-
                        icy-1234567890abcdef0.*$  configures the policy to run
                        only   if   snapshots   created   by    policy    pol-

                                   snapshot  or  AMI  copy. The maximum is 100
                                   years. This is equivalent to  1200  months,
                                   5200 weeks, or 36500 days.

                               IntervalUnit -> (string)
                                   The  unit of time for time-based retention.
                                   For example, to retain a cross-Region  copy
                                   for 3 months, specify Interval=3 and Inter-
                                   valUnit=MONTHS .

              PolicyLanguage -> (string)
                 The type of policy to create. Specify one of the following:

                 o SIMPLIFIED To create a default policy.

                 o STANDARD To create a custom policy.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                     [Default policies only] Specify the type of default  pol-
                     icy to create.

                 o To  create a default policy for EBS snapshots, that creates
                   snapshots of all volumes in the Region that do not have re-
                   cent backups, specify VOLUME .

                 o To  create  a default policy for EBS-backed AMIs, that cre-
                   ates EBS-backed AMIs from all instances in the Region  that
                   do not have recent backups, specify INSTANCE .

              CreateInterval -> (integer)
                     [Default  policies  only]  Specifies how often the policy
                     should run and create snapshots  or  AMIs.  The  creation
                     frequency can range from 1 to 7 days. If you do not spec-
                     ify a value, the default is 1.

                 Default: 1

              RetainInterval -> (integer)
                     [Default policies only] Specifies  how  long  the  policy
                     should retain snapshots or AMIs before deleting them. The
                     retention period can range from 2 to 14 days, but it must
                     be greater than the creation frequency to ensure that the
                     policy retains at least 1 snapshot or AMI  at  any  given
                     time. If you do not specify a value, the default is 7.

                 Default: 7

              CopyTags -> (boolean)
                     [Default  policies  only]  Indicates  whether  the policy
                     should copy tags from the source resource to the snapshot
                     or  AMI.  If  you  do not specify a value, the default is
                     false .

                 Default: false

              CrossRegionCopyTargets -> (list)
                     [Default policies only] Specifies destination Regions for
                     snapshot  or AMI copies. You can specify up to 3 destina-
                     tion Regions. If you do not want to  create  cross-Region
                     copies, omit this parameter.

                 (structure)
                        [Default policies only] Specifies a destination Region
                        for cross-Region copy actions.

                     TargetRegion -> (string)
                        The target Region, for example us-east-1 .

              ExtendDeletion -> (boolean)
                     [Default policies only] Defines the snapshot or  AMI  re-
                     tention  behavior  for the policy if the source volume or
                     instance is deleted, or if the policy enters  the  error,
                     disabled, or deleted state.

                 By default (ExtendDeletion=false ):

                 o If a source resource is deleted, Amazon Data Lifecycle Man-
                   ager will continue to delete previously  created  snapshots
                   or AMIs, up to but not including the last one, based on the
                   specified retention period. If you want Amazon Data Lifecy-
                   cle  Manager to delete all snapshots or AMIs, including the
                   last one, specify true .

                 o If a policy enters the error, disabled, or  deleted  state,
                   Amazon  Data Lifecycle Manager stops deleting snapshots and
                   AMIs. If you want Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager to continue
                   deleting  snapshots or AMIs, including the last one, if the
                   policy enters one of these states, specify true .

                 If you enable extended deletion (ExtendDeletion=true  ),  you
                 override both default behaviors simultaneously.

                 If you do not specify a value, the default is false .

                 Default: false

              Exclusions -> (structure)
                     [Default  policies  only]  Specifies exclusion parameters
                     for volumes or instances for which you  do  not  want  to
                     create  snapshots  or  AMIs.  The  policy will not create
                     snapshots or AMIs for target resources that match any  of
                     the specified exclusion parameters.

                 ExcludeBootVolumes -> (boolean)
                     [Default  policies  for  EBS  snapshots  only]  Indicates
                     whether to exclude volumes that are attached to instances
                     as  the  boot  volume.  If you exclude boot volumes, only
                     volumes attached  as  data  (non-boot)  volumes  will  be
                     backed up by the policy. To exclude boot volumes, specify
                     true .

                 ExcludeVolumeTypes -> (list)
                        [Default policies for EBS  snapshots  only]  Specifies
                        the  volume types to exclude. Volumes of the specified
                        types will not be targeted by the policy.

                     (string)

                 ExcludeTags -> (list)
                        [Default policies for EBS-backed AMIs only]  Specifies
                        whether to exclude volumes that have specific tags.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies a tag for a resource.

                        Key -> (string)

          Tags -> (map)
              The tags.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          PolicyArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy.

          DefaultPolicy -> (boolean)
                 [Default  policies  only]  The type of default policy. Values
                 include:

              o VOLUME - Default policy for EBS snapshots

              o INSTANCE - Default policy for EBS-backed AMIs
