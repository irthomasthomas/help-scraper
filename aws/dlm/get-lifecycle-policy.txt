SYNOPSIS
            get-lifecycle-policy
          --policy-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-id (string)
          The identifier of the lifecycle policy.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                               tion  for  snapshots  created by the policy. To
                               create snapshots in  the  same  Region  as  the
                               source  resource,  specify  CLOUD  .  To create
                               snapshots on the same Outpost as the source re-
                               source,  specify  OUTPOST_LOCAL  .  If you omit
                               this parameter, CLOUD is used by default.

                            If the policy targets resources in an  Amazon  Web
                            Services Region, then you must create snapshots in
                            the same Region as the  source  resource.  If  the
                            policy  targets  resources on an Outpost, then you
                            can create snapshots on the same  Outpost  as  the
                            source resource, or in the Region of that Outpost.

                        Interval -> (integer)
                            The interval between snapshots. The supported val-
                            ues are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.

                        IntervalUnit -> (string)
                            The interval unit.

                        Times -> (list)
                            The time, in UTC, to start the operation. The sup-
                            ported format is hh:mm.

                            The operation occurs within a one-hour window fol-
                            lowing the specified time. If you do not specify a
                            time, Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager selects a time
                            within the next 24 hours.

                            (string)

                        CronExpression -> (string)
                            The schedule, as a Cron expression.  The  schedule
                            interval  must  be  between 1 hour and 1 year. For
                            more information, see Cron expressions in the Ama-
                            zon CloudWatch User Guide .

                     RetainRule -> (structure)
                        The  retention  rule  for snapshots or AMIs created by
                        the policy.

                        Count -> (integer)
                            The number of snapshots to retain for each volume,
                            up  to  a maximum of 1000. For example if you want
                            to retain a maximum of three snapshots, specify  3
                            .  When the fourth snapshot is created, the oldest
                            retained snapshot is deleted, or it  is  moved  to
                            the   archive   tier  if  you  have  specified  an
                            ArchiveRule .

                        Interval -> (integer)
                            The amount of time to retain  each  snapshot.  The
                            maximum  is  100 years. This is equivalent to 1200
                            months, 5200 weeks, or 36500 days.

                        IntervalUnit -> (string)
                            The unit of time for time-based retention. For ex-
                            ample,  to  retain snapshots for 3 months, specify
                            Interval=3  and  IntervalUnit=MONTHS  .  Once  the
                            snapshot  has  been  retained  for 3 months, it is
                            deleted, or it is moved to the archive tier if you
                            have specified an  ArchiveRule .

                     FastRestoreRule -> (structure)
                            [Snapshot  policies  only]  The  rule for enabling
                            fast snapshot restore.

                        Count -> (integer)
                            The number of snapshots to be  enabled  with  fast
                            snapshot restore.

                        Interval -> (integer)
                            The  amount  of  time  to enable fast snapshot re-
                            store. The maximum is 100 years. This  is  equiva-
                            lent to 1200 months, 5200 weeks, or 36500 days.

                        IntervalUnit -> (string)
                            The  unit  of  time for enabling fast snapshot re-
                            store.

                        AvailabilityZones -> (list)
                            The Availability Zones in  which  to  enable  fast
                            snapshot restore.

                            (string)

                     CrossRegionCopyRules -> (list)
                        Specifies  a rule for copying snapshots or AMIs across
                        regions.

                        NOTE:
                            You can't  specify  cross-Region  copy  rules  for
                            policies  that  create snapshots on an Outpost. If
                            the policy creates snapshots  in  a  Region,  then
                            snapshots  can be copied to up to three Regions or
                            Outposts.

                        (structure)
                               [Snapshot and AMI policies  only]  Specifies  a
                               cross-Region  copy  rule  for  snapshot and AMI
                               policies.

                            NOTE:
                               To  specify  a  cross-Region  copy  action  for
                               event-based polices, use  CrossRegionCopyAction
                               .

                            TargetRegion -> (string)

                               NOTE:
                                   Avoid using this  parameter  when  creating
                                   new  policies. Instead, use Target to spec-
                                   ify a target Region or a target Outpost for
                                   snapshot copies.

                                   For  policies created before the Target pa-
                                   rameter was introduced, this parameter  in-
                                   dicates  the  target  Region  for  snapshot
                                   copies.

                            Target -> (string)
                               The target Region or the Amazon  Resource  Name
                               (ARN)  of  the  target Outpost for the snapshot
                               copies.

                               Use this parameter instead of TargetRegion . Do
                               not specify both.

                            Encrypted -> (boolean)
                               To encrypt a copy of an unencrypted snapshot if
                               encryption by default is  not  enabled,  enable
                               encryption  using this parameter. Copies of en-
                               crypted snapshots are encrypted, even  if  this
                               parameter  is false or if encryption by default
                               is not enabled.

                            CmkArn -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  KMS  key
                               to use for EBS encryption. If this parameter is
                               not specified, the default KMS key for the  ac-
                               count is used.

                            CopyTags -> (boolean)
                               Indicates whether to copy all user-defined tags
                               from  the  source  snapshot  or  AMI   to   the
                               cross-Region copy.

                            RetainRule -> (structure)
                               The  retention rule that indicates how long the
                               cross-Region snapshot or AMI copies are  to  be
                               retained in the destination Region.

                               Interval -> (integer)
                                   The amount of time to retain a cross-Region
                                   snapshot or AMI copy. The  maximum  is  100
                                   years.  This  is equivalent to 1200 months,
                                   5200 weeks, or 36500 days.

                               IntervalUnit -> (string)
                                   The unit of time for time-based  retention.
                                   For  example, to retain a cross-Region copy
                                   for 3 months, specify Interval=3 and Inter-
                                   valUnit=MONTHS .

                            DeprecateRule -> (structure)
                                   [AMI  policies  only]  The  AMI deprecation
                                   rule for cross-Region AMI copies created by
                                   the rule.

                               Interval -> (integer)
                                   The  period  after  which  to deprecate the
                                   cross-Region AMI copies. The period must be
                                   less  than or equal to the cross-Region AMI
                                   copy retention  period,  and  it  can't  be
                                   greater  than  10 years. This is equivalent
                                   to 120 months, 520 weeks, or 3650 days.

                               IntervalUnit -> (string)
                                   The unit of time in which  to  measure  the
                                   Interval  .  For  example,  to  deprecate a
                                   cross-Region AMI copy after 3 months, spec-
                                   ify Interval=3 and IntervalUnit=MONTHS .

                            snapshots with other Amazon Web Services accounts.

                        (structure)
                               [Snapshot policies only] Specifies a  rule  for
                               sharing  snapshots  across  Amazon Web Services

                            TargetAccounts -> (list)
                               The IDs of the  Amazon  Web  Services  accounts
                               with which to share the snapshots.

                               (string)

                            UnshareInterval -> (integer)
                               The  period  after  which  snapshots  that  are
                               shared with other Amazon Web Services  accounts
                               are automatically unshared.

                            UnshareIntervalUnit -> (string)
                               The  unit  of  time for the automatic unsharing
                               interval.

                     DeprecateRule -> (structure)
                            [AMI policies only] The AMI deprecation  rule  for
                            the schedule.

                        Count -> (integer)
                            If  the schedule has a count-based retention rule,
                            this parameter specifies the number of oldest AMIs
                            to deprecate. The count must be less than or equal
                            to the schedule's retention count, and it can't be
                            greater than 1000.

                        Interval -> (integer)
                            If  the  schedule has an age-based retention rule,
                            this parameter specifies the period after which to
                            deprecate AMIs created by the schedule. The period
                            must be less than or equal to the  schedule's  re-
                            tention  period,  and  it can't be greater than 10
                            years. This  is  equivalent  to  120  months,  520
                            weeks, or 3650 days.

                        IntervalUnit -> (string)
                            The  unit of time in which to measure the Interval

                     ArchiveRule -> (structure)
                            [Snapshot policies that target volumes  only]  The
                            snapshot archiving rule for the schedule. When you
                            specify an archiving rule, snapshots are automati-
                            cally  moved from the standard tier to the archive
                            tier once the schedule's  retention  threshold  is
                            met.  Snapshots  are  then retained in the archive
                            tier for the archive  retention  period  that  you
                            specify.

                        see Considerations for snapshot lifecycle policies .

                        RetainRule -> (structure)
                            Information about the  retention  period  for  the
                            snapshot archiving rule.

                            RetentionArchiveTier -> (structure)
                               Information  about retention period in the Ama-
                               zon EBS Snapshots Archive.  For  more  informa-
                               tion, see Archive Amazon EBS snapshots .

                               Count -> (integer)

                                   in the archive storage tier for  each  vol-
                                   ume.  The count must ensure that each snap-
                                   shot remains in the  archive  tier  for  at
                                   least 90 days. For example, if the schedule
                                   creates snapshots every 30 days,  you  must
                                   specify a count of 3 or more to ensure that
                                   each snapshot is archived for at  least  90
                                   days.

                               Interval -> (integer)
                                   Specifies  the  period  of  time  to retain
                                   snapshots in the archive tier.  After  this
                                   period expires, the snapshot is permanently
                                   deleted.

                               IntervalUnit -> (string)
                                   The unit of time in which  to  measure  the
                                   Interval  .  For example, to retain a snap-
                                   shots in the archive  tier  for  6  months,
                                   specify  Interval=6 and IntervalUnit=MONTHS
                                   .

              Parameters -> (structure)
                     [Snapshot and AMI policies only] A set of optional param-
                     eters for snapshot and AMI lifecycle policies.

                 NOTE:
                     If  you are modifying a policy that was created or previ-
                     ously modified using the Amazon  Data  Lifecycle  Manager
                     console, then you must include this parameter and specify
                     either the default values or the new values that you  re-
                     quire. You can't omit this parameter or set its values to
                     null.

                 ExcludeBootVolume -> (boolean)
                     [Snapshot policies that target instances only]  Indicates
                     whether  to  exclude  the  root  volume from multi-volume
                     snapshot sets. The default is false . If you specify true
                     ,  then  the  root volumes attached to targeted instances
                     will be excluded from the multi-volume snapshot sets cre-
                     ated by the policy.

                 NoReboot -> (boolean)
                     [AMI  policies only] Indicates whether targeted instances
                     are rebooted when the lifecycle policy runs.  true  indi-
                     cates  that  targeted instances are not rebooted when the
                     policy runs. false indicates that  target  instances  are
                     rebooted  when  the policy runs. The default is true (in-
                     stances are not rebooted).

                 ExcludeDataVolumeTags -> (list)
                        [Snapshot policies that  target  instances  only]  The
                        tags  used  to identify data (non-root) volumes to ex-
                        clude from multi-volume snapshot sets.

                     If you create a snapshot lifecycle  policy  that  targets
                     instances  and  you specify tags for this parameter, then
                     data volumes with the specified tags that are attached to
                     targeted instances will be excluded from the multi-volume
                     snapshot sets created by the policy.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies a tag for a resource.

                        Key -> (string)

              EventSource -> (structure)
                     [Event-based policies only] The event that activates  the
                     event-based policy.

                 Type -> (string)

                     Watch Events rules are supported.

                 Parameters -> (structure)
                     Information about the event.

                     EventType -> (string)
                        The type of event. Currently,  only  snapshot  sharing

                     SnapshotOwner -> (list)
                        The  IDs  of the Amazon Web Services accounts that can
                        trigger policy by sharing snapshots with your account.
                        The  policy  only  runs if one of the specified Amazon
                        Web Services accounts shares a snapshot with your  ac-
                        count.

                        The  snapshot description that can trigger the policy.
                        The description pattern is specified using  a  regular
                        expression.  The policy runs only if a snapshot with a
                        description that  matches  the  specified  pattern  is
                        shared with your account.

                        For  example,  specifying  ^.*Created for policy: pol-
                        icy-1234567890abcdef0.*$ configures the policy to  run
                        only    if    snapshots   created   by   policy   pol-
                        icy-1234567890abcdef0 are shared with your account.

                               shot and AMI policies, use  CrossRegionCopyRule
                               .

                            Target -> (string)

                                   ter.  Copies of encrypted snapshots are en-
                                   crypted, even if this parameter is false or
                                   when encryption by default is not enabled.

                               CmkArn -> (string)

                                   key for the account is used.

                            RetainRule -> (structure)
                               Specifies a  retention  rule  for  cross-Region
                               snapshot   copies   created   by   snapshot  or
                               event-based  policies,  or   cross-Region   AMI
                               copies  created  by AMI policies. After the re-
                               tention period expires, the  cross-Region  copy
                               is deleted.

                                   years.  This  is equivalent to 1200 months,
                                   5200 weeks, or 36500 days.

                               IntervalUnit -> (string)
                                   The unit of time for time-based  retention.
                                   For  example, to retain a cross-Region copy
                                   for 3 months, specify Interval=3 and Inter-
                                   valUnit=MONTHS .
