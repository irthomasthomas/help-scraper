DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns the  IPSet that is specified by IPSetId .

SYNOPSIS
            get-ip-set
          --ip-set-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ip-set-id (string)
          The IPSetId of the  IPSet that you want to get. IPSetId is  returned
          by  CreateIPSet and by  ListIPSets .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       IPSet -> (structure)
          Information about the  IPSet that you specified in the GetIPSet  re-
          quest. For more information, see the following topics:

          o IPSet : Contains IPSetDescriptors , IPSetId , and Name

          o IPSetDescriptors  : Contains an array of  IPSetDescriptor objects.
            Each IPSetDescriptor object contains Type and Value

          IPSetId -> (string)
              The IPSetId for an IPSet . You use IPSetId  to  get  information
              about  an  IPSet  (see   GetIPSet  ),  update an IPSet (see  Up-
              dateIPSet ), insert an IPSet into a Rule or delete  one  from  a
              Rule  (see   UpdateRule ), and delete an IPSet from AWS WAF (see
              DeleteIPSet ).
                 IPSetId is returned by  CreateIPSet and by  ListIPSets .

          Name -> (string)
              A friendly name or description of the  IPSet . You can't  change
              the name of an IPSet after you create it.

          IPSetDescriptors -> (list)
              The IP address type (IPV4 or IPV6 ) and the IP address range (in
              CIDR notation) that web requests originate from. If  the  WebACL
              is  associated with a CloudFront distribution and the viewer did
              not use an HTTP proxy or a load balancer to  send  the  request,
              this  is  the  value  of the c-ip field in the CloudFront access
              logs.

                     This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  informa-
                     tion, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                        For  the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2
                        API and see the AWS WAF Developer  Guide  .  With  the
                        latest  version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints
                        for regional and global use.

                 Specifies the IP address type (IPV4 or IPV6 ) and the IP  ad-
                 dress  range  (in  CIDR  format)  that web requests originate
                 from.

                 Type -> (string)
                     Specify IPV4 or IPV6 .

                 Value -> (string)
                     Specify an IPv4 address by using CIDR notation. For exam-
                     ple:

                     o To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests
                       that originated from the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify
                       192.0.2.44/32 .

                     o To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests
                       that originated from IP  addresses  from  192.0.2.0  to
                       192.0.2.255, specify 192.0.2.0/24 .

                     Wikipedia entry Classless Inter-Domain Routing .

                     Specify an IPv6 address by using CIDR notation. For exam-
                     ple:

                     o To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests
                       that     originated     from     the     IP     address
                       1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111,        specify
                       1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128 .

                     o To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests
                       that       originated       from      IP      addresses
