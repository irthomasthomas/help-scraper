DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Creates a RuleGroup . A rule group is a collection of predefined  rules
       that you add to a web ACL. You use  UpdateRuleGroup to add rules to the
       rule group.

       Rule groups are subject to the following limits:

       o Three rule groups per account. You can request an  increase  to  this
         limit by contacting customer support.

       o One rule group per web ACL.

       o Ten rules per rule group.

       For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block
       HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .

              NOTE:
                 This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide  .  With  the  latest
                     version,  AWS  WAF  has a single set of endpoints for re-
                     gional and global use.

              A tag associated with an AWS resource. Tags are key:value  pairs
              that  you  can  use to categorize and manage your resources, for
              purposes like billing. For example, you might set the tag key to
              "customer"  and  the  value  to the customer name or ID. You can
              specify one or more tags to add to each AWS resource, up  to  50
              tags for a resource.

              Tagging  is  only  available through the API, SDKs, and CLI. You
              can't manage or view tags through the AWS WAF  Classic  console.
              You  can  tag  the AWS resources that you manage through AWS WAF
              Classic: web ACLs, rule groups, and rules.

              Key -> (string)

              Value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

OUTPUT
       RuleGroup -> (structure)
          An empty  RuleGroup .

          RuleGroupId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for a RuleGroup . You use RuleGroupId to get
              more information about a RuleGroup (see  GetRuleGroup ),  update
              a  RuleGroup  (see  UpdateRuleGroup ), insert a RuleGroup into a
              WebACL or delete a one from a WebACL (see   UpdateWebACL  ),  or
              delete a RuleGroup from AWS WAF (see  DeleteRuleGroup ).
                 RuleGroupId is returned by  CreateRuleGroup and by  ListRule-
                 Groups .

          Name -> (string)

              Group . The name can contain only alphanumeric characters  (A-Z,

              can't contain whitespace or metric names reserved for  AWS  WAF,
              including  "All" and "Default_Action." You can't change the name
              of the metric after you create the RuleGroup .

       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The ChangeToken that you used to submit the CreateRuleGroup request.
          You  can also use this value to query the status of the request. For
          more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
