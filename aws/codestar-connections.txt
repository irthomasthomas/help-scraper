DESCRIPTION
       This  Amazon  Web  Services CodeStar Connections API Reference provides
       descriptions and usage examples of the operations and  data  types  for
       the  Amazon Web Services CodeStar Connections API. You can use the con-
       nections API to work with connections and installations.
          Connections are configurations that you use to  connect  Amazon  Web
          Services resources to external code repositories. Each connection is
          a resource that can be given to services  such  as  CodePipeline  to
          connect  to a third-party repository such as Bitbucket. For example,
          you can add the connection in CodePipeline so that it triggers  your
          pipeline when a code change is made to your third-party code reposi-
          tory. Each connection is named and associated with a unique ARN that
          is used to reference the connection.

       When  you create a connection, the console initiates a third-party con-
       nection handshake. Installations are the apps that are used to  conduct
       this  handshake.  For  example,  the  installation  for  the  Bitbucket
       provider type is the Bitbucket app. When you create a  connection,  you
       can choose an existing installation or create one.

       When you want to create a connection to an installed provider type such
       as GitHub Enterprise Server, you create a host for your connections.

       You can work with connections by calling:

       o CreateConnection , which creates a uniquely named connection that can
         be referenced by services such as CodePipeline.

       o DeleteConnection , which deletes the specified connection.

       o GetConnection  ,  which returns information about the connection, in-
         cluding the connection status.

       o ListConnections , which lists the connections  associated  with  your
         account.

       You can work with hosts by calling:

       o CreateHost  , which creates a host that represents the infrastructure
         where your provider is installed.

       o DeleteHost , which deletes the specified host.

       o GetHost , which returns information about  the  host,  including  the
         setup status.

       o ListHosts , which lists the hosts associated with your account.

       You  can  work with tags in Amazon Web Services CodeStar Connections by
       calling the following:

       o ListTagsForResource , which gets information about  Amazon  Web  Ser-
         vices  tags  for a specified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in Amazon Web
         Services CodeStar Connections.

       o TagResource , which adds or updates tags for a resource in Amazon Web
         Services CodeStar Connections.

       o UntagResource  , which removes tags for a resource in Amazon Web Ser-
         vices CodeStar Connections.

       For information about how to use Amazon Web Services  CodeStar  Connec-
       tions, see the Developer Tools User Guide .
