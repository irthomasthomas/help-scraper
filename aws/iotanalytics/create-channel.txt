CREATE-CHANNEL()                                              CREATE-CHANNEL()



NAME
       create-channel -

DESCRIPTION
       Used  to  create  a channel. A channel collects data from an MQTT topic
       and archives the raw, unprocessed messages before publishing  the  data
       to a pipeline.

OPTIONS
       --channel-name (string)
          The name of the channel.

       --channel-storage (structure)
          Where channel data is stored. You can choose one of serviceManagedS3
          or customerManagedS3 storage. If not specified, the default is  ser-
          viceManagedS3 . You can't change this storage option after the chan-
          nel is created.

          serviceManagedS3 -> (structure)
              Used to store channel data in an S3 bucket managed by  IoT  Ana-
              lytics. You can't change the choice of S3 storage after the data
              store is created.

          customerManagedS3 -> (structure)
              Used to store channel data in an S3 bucket that you  manage.  If
              customer managed storage is selected, the retentionPeriod param-
              eter is ignored. You can't change the choice of S3 storage after
              the data store is created.

              bucket -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket in which channel data is stored.

              keyPrefix -> (string)
                 (Optional)  The prefix used to create the keys of the channel
                 data objects. Each object in an S3 bucket has a key  that  is
                 its  unique identifier in the bucket. Each object in a bucket
                 has exactly one key. The prefix must end with a forward slash
                 (/).

              roleArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of the role that grants IoT Analytics permission to
                 interact with your Amazon S3 resources.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          serviceManagedS3={},customerManagedS3={bucket=string,keyPrefix=string,roleArn=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "serviceManagedS3": {

            },
            "customerManagedS3": {
              "bucket": "string",
              "keyPrefix": "string",
              "roleArn": "string"
            }
          }

       --retention-period (structure)
          How long, in days, message data is kept for the channel.  When  cus-
          tomerManagedS3 storage is selected, this parameter is ignored.

          unlimited -> (boolean)
              If true, message data is kept indefinitely.

          numberOfDays -> (integer)
              The  number of days that message data is kept. The unlimited pa-
              rameter must be false.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          unlimited=boolean,numberOfDays=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "unlimited": true|false,
            "numberOfDays": integer
          }

       --tags (list)
          Metadata which can be used to manage the channel.

          (structure)
              A set of key-value pairs that are used to manage the resource.

              key -> (string)
                 The tag's key.

              value -> (string)
                 The tag's value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a channel

       The  following create-channel example creates a channel with the speci-
       fied configuration. A channel collects data from an MQTT topic and  ar-
       chives  the  raw,  unprocessed messages before publishing the data to a
       pipeline.

          aws iotanalytics create-channel \
              --cli-input-json file://create-channel.json

       Contents of create-channel.json:

          {
              "channelName": "mychannel",
              "retentionPeriod": {
                  "unlimited": true
              },
              "tags": [
                  {
                      "key": "Environment",
                      "value": "Production"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Output:

          {
              "channelArn": "arn:aws:iotanalytics:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/mychannel",
              "channelName": "mychannel",
              "retentionPeriod": {
                  "unlimited": true
              }
          }

       Reference.
