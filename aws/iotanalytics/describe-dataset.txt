SYNOPSIS
            describe-dataset
          --dataset-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dataset-name (string)
          The name of the dataset whose information is retrieved.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              The ARN of the dataset.

          actions -> (list)
              The  DatasetAction objects that automatically create the dataset

                 are automatically created.

                 actionName -> (string)
                     The  name of the dataset action by which dataset contents
                     are automatically created.

                 queryAction -> (structure)
                     An SqlQueryDatasetAction object that uses an SQL query to
                     automatically create dataset contents.

                     sqlQuery -> (string)
                        A SQL query string.

                     filters -> (list)
                        Prefilters applied to message data.

                        (structure)
                            Information  that  is used to filter message data,
                            to segregate it  according  to  the  timeframe  in
                            which it arrives.

                            deltaTime -> (structure)
                               Used  to  limit  data to that which has arrived
                               since the last execution of the action.

                               offsetSeconds -> (integer)
                                   The  number   of   seconds   of   estimated
                                   in-flight  lag  time  of message data. When
                                   you create dataset contents  using  message
                                   data  from a specified timeframe, some mes-
                                   sage data might still  be  in  flight  when
                                   processing  begins, and so do not arrive in
                                   time to be processed.  Use  this  field  to
                                   make  allowances  for the in flight time of
                                   your message data, so that  data  not  pro-
                                   cessed  from  a  previous  timeframe is in-
                                   cluded with the next timeframe.  Otherwise,
                                   missed  message data would be excluded from
                                   processing during the next  timeframe  too,
                                   because  its timestamp places it within the
                                   previous timeframe.

                               timeExpression -> (string)
                                   An expression by which the time of the mes-
                                   sage  data might be determined. This can be
                                   the name of a timestamp field or a SQL  ex-
                                   pression  that  is  used to derive the time
                                   the message data was generated.

                 containerAction -> (structure)
                     Information that allows the system to run a containerized
                     application  to create the dataset contents. The applica-
                     tion must be in a Docker container  along  with  any  re-
                     quired support libraries.

                        count. The Docker container  contains  an  application
                        and required support libraries and is used to generate

                        The ARN of the role that gives permission to the  sys-
                        tem to access required resources to run the container-
                        Action . This includes, at minimum, permission to  re-
                        trieve  the dataset contents that are the input to the
                        containerized application.

                        ecution  of  the containerized application (basically,
                        parameters passed to the application).  Each  variable
                        must  have  a name and a value given by one of string-

                            o Use !{iotanalytics:versionId} to insert a unique
                              hash that identifies a dataset content.

                            o Use  !{iotanalytics:creationTime}  to insert the
                              creation time of a dataset content.

                            The following example creates a unique key  for  a
                            CSV  file: dataset/mydataset/!{iotanalytics:sched-
                            uleTime}/!{iotanalytics:versionId}.csv

                            NOTE:
                               If you don't use  !{iotanalytics:versionId}  to
                               specify  the key, you might get duplicate keys.
                               For example, you might have  two  dataset  con-
                               tents  with the same scheduleTime but different
                               versionId s. This means that one  dataset  con-
                               tent overwrites the other.

                        glueConfiguration -> (structure)

              When the dataset was created.

          lastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
              The last time the dataset was updated.

          retentionPeriod -> (structure)
              Optional.  How  long,  in  days,  message  data  is kept for the
              dataset.

              unlimited -> (boolean)
                 If true, message data is kept indefinitely.

              numberOfDays -> (integer)
                 The number of days that message data is kept.  The  unlimited
                 parameter must be false.

          versioningConfiguration -> (structure)
              Optional. How many versions of dataset contents are kept. If not
              specified or set to null, only the latest version plus the  lat-
              est  succeeded  version (if they are different) are kept for the
              time period specified by the retentionPeriod parameter. For more
              information,  see  Keeping  Multiple  Versions  of IoT Analytics
              datasets in the IoT Analytics User Guide .

              unlimited -> (boolean)
                 If true, unlimited versions of dataset contents are kept.

              data arrives late. To specify lateDataRules , the  dataset  must
              use a DeltaTimer filter.

              (structure)
                 A structure that contains the name and configuration informa-
                 tion of a late data rule.

                 ruleName -> (string)
                     The name of the late data rule.

                 ruleConfiguration -> (structure)

                     deltaTimeSessionWindowConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The information needed to configure a delta time  ses-
                        sion window.

                        timeoutInMinutes -> (integer)
                            A  time  interval. You can use timeoutInMinutes so
                            that IoT Analytics can batch up late data  notifi-
                            cations  that  have  been generated since the last
                            execution. IoT Analytics sends one batch of  noti-
                            fications to Amazon CloudWatch Events at one time.
