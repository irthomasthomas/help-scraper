LIST-CHANNELS()                                                LIST-CHANNELS()



NAME
       list-channels -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a list of channels.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-channels  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: channelSummaries

            list-channels
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve a list of channels

       The following list-channels example displays  summary  information  for
       the available channels.

          aws iotanalytics list-channels

       Output:

          {
              "channelSummaries": [
                  {
                      "status": "ACTIVE",
                      "channelName": "mychannel",
                      "creationTime": 1557860351.001,
                      "lastUpdateTime": 1557860351.001
                  }
              ]
          }

       For  more  information,  see  ListChannels in the AWS IoT Analytics API
       Reference.

OUTPUT
       channelSummaries -> (list)
          A list of ChannelSummary objects.

          (structure)
              A summary of information about a channel.

              channelName -> (string)
                 The name of the channel.

              channelStorage -> (structure)
                 Where channel data is stored.

                 serviceManagedS3 -> (structure)
                     Used to store channel data in an S3 bucket managed by IoT
                     Analytics.

                 customerManagedS3 -> (structure)
                     Used  to store channel data in an S3 bucket that you man-
                     age.

                     bucket -> (string)
                        The name of the S3 bucket in  which  channel  data  is
                        stored.

                     keyPrefix -> (string)
                        (Optional)  The  prefix used to create the keys of the
                        channel data objects. Each object in an S3 bucket  has
                        a  key that is its unique identifier within the bucket
                        (each object in a bucket has  exactly  one  key).  The
                        prefix must end with a forward slash (/).

                     roleArn -> (string)
                        The  ARN of the role that grants IoT Analytics permis-
                        sion to interact with your Amazon S3 resources.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the channel.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the channel was created.

              lastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last time the channel was updated.

              lastMessageArrivalTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last time when a new message arrived in the channel.

                 IoT Analytics updates this value at most once per minute  for
                 one  channel.  Hence,  the lastMessageArrivalTime value is an
                 approximation.

                 This feature only applies to messages  that  arrived  in  the
                 data store after October 23, 2020.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  token to retrieve the next set of results, or null if there are
          no more results.
