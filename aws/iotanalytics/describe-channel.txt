DESCRIBE-CHANNEL()                                          DESCRIBE-CHANNEL()



NAME
       describe-channel -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about a channel.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-channel
          --channel-name <value>
          [--include-statistics | --no-include-statistics]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-name (string)
          The name of the channel whose information is retrieved.

       --include-statistics | --no-include-statistics (boolean)
          If true, additional statistical information about the channel is in-
          cluded in the response. This feature can't be used  with  a  channel
          whose S3 storage is customer-managed.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve information about a channel

       The following describe-channel example displays details, including sta-
       tistics, for the specified channel.

          aws iotanalytics describe-channel \
              --channel-name mychannel \
              --include-statistics

       Output:

          {
              "statistics": {

                      "estimatedSizeInBytes": 402.0,
                      "estimatedOn": 1561504380.0
                  }

                  "status": "ACTIVE",
                  "name": "mychannel",

                  "creationTime": 1557860351.001,
                  "retentionPeriod": {
                      "unlimited": true
                  },

          }

OUTPUT
       channel -> (structure)
          An object that contains information about the channel.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the channel.

          storage -> (structure)
              Where  channel data is stored. You can choose one of serviceMan-
              agedS3 or customerManagedS3 storage. If not specified,  the  de-
              fault is serviceManagedS3 . You can't change this storage option
              after the channel is created.

              serviceManagedS3 -> (structure)
                 Used to store channel data in an S3 bucket managed by IoT An-
                 alytics.  You can't change the choice of S3 storage after the
                 data store is created.

              customerManagedS3 -> (structure)
                 Used to store channel data in an S3 bucket that  you  manage.
                 If  customer managed storage is selected, the retentionPeriod
                 parameter is ignored. You can't change the choice of S3 stor-
                 age after the data store is created.

                 bucket -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  S3  bucket  in  which channel data is
                     stored.

                 keyPrefix -> (string)
                     (Optional) The prefix used to  create  the  keys  of  the
                     channel  data  objects. Each object in an S3 bucket has a
                     key that is its unique identifier in the bucket. Each ob-
                     ject in a bucket has exactly one key. The prefix must end
                     with a forward slash (/).

                 roleArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of the role that grants IoT Analytics  permission
                     to interact with your Amazon S3 resources.

          arn -> (string)
              The ARN of the channel.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the channel.

          retentionPeriod -> (structure)
              How long, in days, message data is kept for the channel.

              unlimited -> (boolean)
                 If true, message data is kept indefinitely.

              numberOfDays -> (integer)
                 The  number  of days that message data is kept. The unlimited
                 parameter must be false.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              When the channel was created.

          lastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
              When the channel was last updated.

          lastMessageArrivalTime -> (timestamp)
              The last time when a new message arrived in the channel.

              IoT Analytics updates this value at most once per minute for one
              channel.  Hence, the lastMessageArrivalTime value is an approxi-
              mation.

              This feature only applies to messages that arrived in  the  data
              store after October 23, 2020.

       statistics -> (structure)
          Statistics  about the channel. Included if the includeStatistics pa-
          rameter is set to true in the request.

          size -> (structure)
              The estimated size of the channel.

              estimatedSizeInBytes -> (double)
                 The estimated size of the resource, in bytes.

              estimatedOn -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the estimate of the size of  the  resource  was
                 made.
