NAME
       describe-recommender -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the given recommender, including its status.

       A recommender can be in one of the following states:

       o CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

       o STOP  PENDING  >  STOP IN_PROGRESS > INACTIVE > START PENDING > START
         IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE

       o DELETE PENDING > DELETE IN_PROGRESS

       When the status is CREATE FAILED , the response  includes  the  failur-
       eReason key, which describes why.

       The  modelMetrics  key is null when the recommender is being created or
       deleted.

       For more information on recommenders, see CreateRecommender .

SYNOPSIS
            describe-recommender
          --recommender-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --recommender-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recommender to describe.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
