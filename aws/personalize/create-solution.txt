CREATE-SOLUTION()                                            CREATE-SOLUTION()



NAME
       create-solution -

DESCRIPTION
       WARNING:
          By default, all new solutions use automatic training. With automatic
          training, you incur training costs while your solution is active. To
          avoid  unnecessary  costs,  when you are finished you can update the
          solution to turn  off  automatic  training.  For  information  about
          training costs, see Amazon Personalize pricing .

       Creates  the  configuration  for  training a model (creating a solution
       version). This configuration includes  the  recipe  to  use  for  model
       training and optional training configuration, such as columns to use in
       training and feature transformation parameters.  For  more  information
       about configuring a solution, see Creating and configuring a solution .

       By  default,  new  solutions  use automatic training to create solution
       versions every 7 days. You can change the training frequency. Automatic
       solution  version creation starts within one hour after the solution is
       ACTIVE. If you manually create a solution version within the hour,  the
       solution  skips the first automatic training. For more information, see
       Configuring automatic training .

       To turn off automatic training, set performAutoTraining  to  false.  If
       you  turn  off  automatic training, you must manually create a solution
       version by calling the CreateSolutionVersion operation.

       After training starts, you can get the solution  version's  Amazon  Re-
       source  Name  (ARN) with the ListSolutionVersions API operation. To get
       its status, use the DescribeSolutionVersion .

       After training completes you can evaluate  model  accuracy  by  calling
       GetSolutionMetrics  . When you are satisfied with the solution version,
       you deploy it using CreateCampaign . The campaign provides  recommenda-
       tions to a client through the GetRecommendations API.

       NOTE:
              Amazon  Personalize doesn't support configuring the hpoObjective
              for solution hyperparameter optimization at this time.

          Status

       A solution can be in one of the following states:

       o CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

       o DELETE PENDING > DELETE IN_PROGRESS

       To get the status of the solution, call DescribeSolution . If  you  use
       manual  training, the status must be ACTIVE before you call CreateSolu-
       tionVersion .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name for the solution.

       --perform-hpo | --no-perform-hpo (boolean)
          Whether to perform hyperparameter optimization (HPO) on  the  speci-
          fied or selected recipe. The default is false .

          When performing AutoML, this parameter is always true and you should
          not set it to false .

       --perform-auto-ml | --no-perform-auto-ml (boolean)

          WARNING:
              We don't recommend enabling automated machine learning. Instead,
              match your use case to the available Amazon Personalize recipes.
              For more information, see Choosing a recipe .

          Whether to perform automated machine learning (AutoML). The  default
          is false . For this case, you must specify recipeArn .

          When  set  to  true , Amazon Personalize analyzes your training data
          and selects the optimal USER_PERSONALIZATION recipe and hyperparame-
          ters. In this case, you must omit recipeArn . Amazon Personalize de-
          termines the optimal recipe by running tests with  different  values
          for  the  hyperparameters.  AutoML lengthens the training process as
          compared to selecting a specific recipe.

       --perform-auto-training | --no-perform-auto-training (boolean)
          Whether the solution uses automatic training to create new  solution
          versions  (trained models). The default is True and the solution au-
          tomatically creates new solution versions  every  7  days.  You  can
          change  the  training frequency by specifying a schedulingExpression
          in the AutoTrainingConfig as part  of  solution  configuration.  For
          more information about automatic training, see Configuring automatic
          training .

          Automatic solution version creation starts within one hour after the
          solution is ACTIVE. If you manually create a solution version within
          the hour, the solution skips the first automatic training.

          After training starts, you can get the solution version's Amazon Re-
          source  Name  (ARN)  with the ListSolutionVersions API operation. To
          get its status, use the DescribeSolutionVersion .

       --recipe-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recipe to use for model train-
          ing.  This  is required when performAutoML is false. For information
          about different Amazon  Personalize  recipes  and  their  ARNs,  see
          Choosing a recipe .

       --dataset-group-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the dataset group that provides
          the training data.

       --event-type (string)
          When your have multiple event  types  (using  an  EVENT_TYPE  schema
          field),  this  parameter  specifies  which  event type (for example,
          'click' or 'like') is used for training the model.

          If you do not provide an eventType , Amazon Personalize will use all
          interactions for training with equal weight regardless of type.

       --solution-config (structure)
          The configuration properties for the solution. When performAutoML is
          set to true, Amazon Personalize only evaluates the autoMLConfig sec-
          tion of the solution configuration.

          NOTE:
              Amazon  Personalize doesn't support configuring the hpoObjective
              at this time.

          eventValueThreshold -> (string)
              Only events with a value greater than or equal to this threshold
              are used for training a model.

                 sions.  Specify  a rate expression in rate(value  unit ) for-
                 mat. For value, specify a number between 1 and 30. For  unit,
                 specify  day or days . For example, to automatically create a
                 new solution version every 5 days, specify rate(5 days) . The
                 default is every 7 days.

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags to apply to the solution.

          (structure)
              The optional metadata that you apply to resources  to  help  you
              categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an
              optional value, both of which you define. For  more  information
              see Tagging Amazon Personalize resources .

              tagKey -> (string)
                 One  part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              tagValue -> (string)
                 The  optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          tagKey=string,tagValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [

            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.
