CREATE-DATA-DELETION-JOB()                          CREATE-DATA-DELETION-JOB()



NAME
       create-data-deletion-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a batch job that deletes all references to specific users from
       an Amazon Personalize dataset group in batches. You specify  the  users
       to  delete in a CSV file of userIds in an Amazon S3 bucket. After a job
       completes, Amazon Personalize no longer trains on the users data and no
       longer  considers the users when generating user segments. For more in-
       formation about creating a data deletion job, see Deleting users .

       o Your input file must be a CSV file with a single USER_ID column  that
         lists  the  users  IDs.  For more information about preparing the CSV
         file, see Preparing your data deletion file and uploading it to  Ama-
         zon S3 .

       o To  give  Amazon Personalize permission to access your input CSV file
         of userIds, you must specify an IAM service role that has  permission
         to  read  from  the  data source. This role needs GetObject and List-
         Bucket permissions for the bucket and its content. These  permissions
         are the same as importing data. For information on granting access to
         your Amazon S3 bucket, see Giving Amazon Personalize Access to Amazon
         S3 Resources .

       After  you  create  a job, it can take up to a day to delete all refer-
       ences to the users from datasets and models. Until the  job  completes,
       Amazon  Personalize continues to use the data when training. And if you
       use a User Segmentation recipe, the users might  appear  in  user  seg-
       ments.
          Status

       A data deletion job can have one of the following statuses:

       o PENDING > IN_PROGRESS > COMPLETED -or- FAILED

       To    get    the    status    of    the   data   deletion   job,   call
       DescribeDataDeletionJob API operation and specify the  Amazon  Resource
       Name (ARN) of the job. If the status is FAILED, the response includes a
       failureReason key, which describes why the job failed.

OPTIONS
       --job-name (string)
          The name for the data deletion job.

       --dataset-group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset  group  that  has  the
          datasets you want to delete records from.

       --data-source (structure)
          The  Amazon S3 bucket that contains the list of userIds of the users
          to delete.

          dataLocation -> (string)
              For dataset import jobs, the path to the Amazon S3 bucket  where
              the  data that you want to upload to your dataset is stored. For
              data deletion jobs, the path to the Amazon S3 bucket that stores
              the list of records to delete.

              For example:
                 s3://bucket-name/folder-name/fileName.csv

              If  your  CSV files are in a folder in your Amazon S3 bucket and
              you want your import job or data deletion job to consider multi-
              ple  files,  you can specify the path to the folder. With a data
              deletion job, Amazon Personalize uses all files  in  the  folder
              and  any sub folder. Use the following syntax with a / after the
              folder name:
                 s3://bucket-name/folder-name/

       Shorthand Syntax:

          dataLocation=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "dataLocation": "string"
          }

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that has  permissions
          to read from the Amazon S3 data source.

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags to apply to the data deletion job.

          (structure)
              The  optional  metadata  that you apply to resources to help you
              categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and  an
              optional  value,  both of which you define. For more information
              see Tagging Amazon Personalize resources .

              tagKey -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A key is  a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              tagValue -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag.  A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          tagKey=string,tagValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "tagKey": "string",
              "tagValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
