DESCRIPTION
       WARNING:
          You  incur  campaign  costs while it is active. To avoid unnecessary
          costs, make sure to delete the campaign when you are  finished.  For
          information about campaign costs, see Amazon Personalize pricing .

       Creates a campaign that deploys a solution version. When a client calls
       the GetRecommendations and GetPersonalizedRanking APIs, a  campaign  is
       specified in the request.
          Minimum Provisioned TPS and Auto-Scaling

       WARNING:
          A  high  minProvisionedTPS  will  increase  your  cost. We recommend
          starting with 1 for minProvisionedTPS (the default). Track your  us-
          age  using  Amazon  CloudWatch  metrics,  and increase the minProvi-
          sionedTPS as necessary.

       When you create an Amazon Personalize campaign,  you  can  specify  the
       minimum  provisioned  transactions  per second (minProvisionedTPS ) for
       the campaign. This is the baseline transaction throughput for the  cam-
       paign  provisioned  by  Amazon Personalize. It sets the minimum billing
       charge for the campaign while it is active. A transaction is  a  single
       GetRecommendations  or GetPersonalizedRanking request. The default min-
       ProvisionedTPS is 1.

       If your TPS increases beyond the minProvisionedTPS , Amazon Personalize
       auto-scales  the provisioned capacity up and down, but never below min-
       ProvisionedTPS . There's a short time delay while the capacity  is  in-
       creased  that  might  cause loss of transactions. When your traffic re-
       duces, capacity returns to the minProvisionedTPS .

       You are charged for the the minimum provisioned TPS  or,  if  your  re-
       quests exceed the minProvisionedTPS , the actual TPS. The actual TPS is
       the total number of recommendation  requests  you  make.  We  recommend
       starting  with  a low minProvisionedTPS , track your usage using Amazon
       CloudWatch metrics, and then increase the minProvisionedTPS  as  neces-
       sary.

       For more information about campaign costs, see Amazon Personalize pric-
       ing .
          Status

       A campaign can be in one of the following states:

       o CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

       o DELETE PENDING > DELETE IN_PROGRESS

       To get the campaign status, call DescribeCampaign .

       NOTE:
              Wait until the status of the campaign is  ACTIVE  before  asking
              the campaign for recommendations.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A name for the new campaign. The campaign name must be unique within
          your account.

       --solution-version-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the trained model to  deploy  with
          the  campaign.  To specify the latest solution version of your solu-
          tion, specify the ARN of your solution in  SolutionArn/$LATEST  for-
          mat.  You must use this format if you set syncWithLatestSolutionVer-
          sion to True in the CampaignConfig .

          To deploy a model that isn't the latest solution version of your so-
          lution, specify the ARN of the solution version.

          For  more information about automatic campaign updates, see Enabling
          automatic campaign updates .

       --min-provisioned-tps (integer)
          Specifies the requested minimum provisioned transactions  (recommen-
          dations)  per  second  that  Amazon Personalize will support. A high
          minProvisionedTPS will increase your  bill.  We  recommend  starting
          with  1  for minProvisionedTPS (the default). Track your usage using
          Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and  increase  the  minProvisionedTPS  as
          necessary.

       --campaign-config (structure)
          The configuration details of a campaign.

          itemExplorationConfig -> (map)
              Specifies the exploration configuration hyperparameters, includ-
              ing explorationWeight and explorationItemAgeCutOff , you want to
              use to configure the amount of item exploration Amazon Personal-
              ize uses when recommending items. Provide  itemExplorationConfig
              data only if your solution uses the User-Personalization recipe.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          enableMetadataWithRecommendations -> (boolean)
              Whether  metadata  with  recommendations is enabled for the cam-
              paign. If enabled, you can specify the columns from  your  Items
              dataset  in your request for recommendations. Amazon Personalize
              returns this data for each item in the recommendation  response.
              For  information  about  enabling  metadata  for a campaign, see
              Enabling metadata in recommendations for a campaign .

              If you enable metadata in recommendations, you will incur  addi-
              tional costs. For more information, see Amazon Personalize pric-
              ing .

          syncWithLatestSolutionVersion -> (boolean)
              Whether the campaign automatically updates to use the latest so-
              lution  version  (trained  model)  of a solution. If you specify
              True , you must specify the ARN of your solution for  the  Solu-
              tionVersionArn parameter. It must be in SolutionArn/$LATEST for-
              mat. The default is False and you must manually update the  cam-
              paign to deploy the latest solution version.

              For  more  information  about  automatic  campaign  updates, see
              Enabling automatic campaign updates .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          itemExplorationConfig={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},enableMetadataWithRecommendations=boolean,syncWithLatestSolutionVersion=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "itemExplorationConfig": {"string": "string"
              ...},
            "enableMetadataWithRecommendations": true|false,
            "syncWithLatestSolutionVersion": true|false
          }

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags to apply to the campaign.

          (structure)
              The optional metadata that you apply to resources  to  help  you
              categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an
              optional value, both of which you define. For  more  information
              see Tagging Amazon Personalize resources .

              tagKey -> (string)
                 One  part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              tagValue -> (string)
                 The  optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          tagKey=string,tagValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "tagKey": "string",
              "tagValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
