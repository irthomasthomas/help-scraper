OPTIONS
       --data-deletion-job-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the data deletion job.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

OUTPUT
       dataDeletionJob -> (structure)
          Information about the data deletion job, including the status.

          The status is one of the following values:

          o PENDING

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o COMPLETED

          o FAILED

          jobName -> (string)
              The name of the data deletion job.

          dataDeletionJobArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the data deletion job.

          datasetGroupArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the dataset group the job
              deletes records from.

          dataSource -> (structure)
              Describes the data source that contains the data to upload to  a
              dataset,  or the list of records to delete from Amazon Personal-
              ize.

              dataLocation -> (string)
                 For dataset import jobs, the path to  the  Amazon  S3  bucket
                 where  the  data  that  you want to upload to your dataset is
                 stored. For data deletion jobs, the path  to  the  Amazon  S3
                 bucket that stores the list of records to delete.

                 For example:
                     s3://bucket-name/folder-name/fileName.csv

                 If  your  CSV  files are in a folder in your Amazon S3 bucket
                 and you want your import job or data deletion job to consider
                 multiple  files, you can specify the path to the folder. With
                 a data deletion job, Amazon Personalize uses all files in the
                 folder  and any sub folder. Use the following syntax with a /
                 after the folder name:
                     s3://bucket-name/folder-name/

          roleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that has  permis-
              sions to read from the Amazon S3 data source.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the data deletion job.

              A data deletion job can have one of the following statuses:

              o PENDING > IN_PROGRESS > COMPLETED -or- FAILED

          numDeleted -> (integer)
              The number of records deleted by a COMPLETED job.

          creationDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The  creation  date and time (in Unix time) of the data deletion
              job.

          lastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time (in Unix time) the data deletion job was  last
              updated.

          failureReason -> (string)
              If a data deletion job fails, provides the reason why.
