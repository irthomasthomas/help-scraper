CREATE-DATASET-EXPORT-JOB()                        CREATE-DATASET-EXPORT-JOB()



NAME
       create-dataset-export-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  job  that  exports  data  from your dataset to an Amazon S3
       bucket. To allow Amazon Personalize to export the  training  data,  you
       must  specify  an service-linked IAM role that gives Amazon Personalize
       PutObject permissions for your Amazon S3 bucket. For  information,  see
       Exporting a dataset in the Amazon Personalize developer guide.
          Status

       A dataset export job can be in one of the following states:

       o CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

       To  get  the  status of the export job, call DescribeDatasetExportJob ,
       and specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset  export  job.
       The  dataset export is complete when the status shows as ACTIVE. If the
       status shows as CREATE FAILED, the response  includes  a  failureReason
       key, which describes why the job failed.

SYNOPSIS
            create-dataset-export-job
          --job-name <value>
          --dataset-arn <value>
          [--ingestion-mode <value>]
          --role-arn <value>
          --job-output <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-name (string)
          The name for the dataset export job.

       --dataset-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset that contains the data
          to export.

       --ingestion-mode (string)
          The data to export, based on how you  imported  the  data.  You  can
          choose  to  export  only BULK data that you imported using a dataset
          import job, only PUT data that you imported incrementally (using the
          console,  PutEvents,  PutUsers  and PutItems operations), or ALL for
          both types. The default value is PUT .

          Possible values:

          o BULK

          o PUT

          o ALL

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM service role that has per-
          missions to add data to your output Amazon S3 bucket.

       --job-output (structure)
          The path to the Amazon S3 bucket where the job's output is stored.

          s3DataDestination -> (structure)
              The  configuration  details  of  an  Amazon  S3  input or output
              bucket.

              path -> (string)
                 The file path of the Amazon S3 bucket.

              kmsKeyArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Key Management  Service
                 (KMS)  key that Amazon Personalize uses to encrypt or decrypt
                 the input and output files.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          s3DataDestination={path=string,kmsKeyArn=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "s3DataDestination": {
              "path": "string",
              "kmsKeyArn": "string"
            }
          }

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags to apply to the dataset export job.

          (structure)
              The optional metadata that you apply to resources  to  help  you
              categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an
              optional value, both of which you define. For  more  information
              see Tagging Personalize resources .

              tagKey -> (string)
                 One  part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              tagValue -> (string)
                 The  optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          tagKey=string,tagValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "tagKey": "string",
              "tagValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       datasetExportJobArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset export job.
