CREATE-SOLUTION-VERSION()                            CREATE-SOLUTION-VERSION()



NAME
       create-solution-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Trains  or retrains an active solution in a Custom dataset group. A so-
       lution is created using the CreateSolution operation and must be in the
       ACTIVE  state  before  calling CreateSolutionVersion . A new version of
       the solution is created every time you call this operation.
          Status

       A solution version can be in one of the following states:

       o CREATE PENDING

       o CREATE IN_PROGRESS

       o ACTIVE

       o CREATE FAILED

       o CREATE STOPPING

       o CREATE STOPPED

       To get the status of the version, call DescribeSolutionVersion  .  Wait
       until the status shows as ACTIVE before calling CreateCampaign .

       If  the  status shows as CREATE FAILED, the response includes a failur-
       eReason key, which describes why the job failed.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the solution version.

       --solution-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the solution containing the train-
          ing configuration information.

       --training-mode (string)
          The  scope  of  training  to be performed when creating the solution
          version. The FULL option trains the solution version  based  on  the
          entirety of the input solution's training data, while the UPDATE op-
          tion processes only the data that has changed in comparison  to  the
          input  solution. Choose UPDATE when you want to incrementally update
          your solution version instead of creating an entirely new one.

          WARNING:
              The UPDATE option can only be used when you already have an  ac-
              tive  solution version created from the input solution using the
              FULL  option  and  the  input  solution  was  trained  with  the
              User-Personalization recipe or the HRNN-Coldstart recipe.

          Possible values:

          o FULL

          o UPDATE

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags to apply to the solution version.

          (structure)
              The  optional  metadata  that you apply to resources to help you
              categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and  an
              optional  value,  both of which you define. For more information
              see Tagging Amazon Personalize recources .

              tagKey -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A key is  a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              tagValue -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag.  A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          tagKey=string,tagValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "tagKey": "string",
              "tagValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       solutionVersionArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the new solution version.
