CREATE-EVENT-TRACKER()                                  CREATE-EVENT-TRACKER()



NAME
       create-event-tracker -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an event tracker that you use when adding event data to a spec-
       ified dataset group using the PutEvents API.

       NOTE:
          Only one event tracker can be associated with a dataset  group.  You
          will  get  an  error  if  you call CreateEventTracker using the same
          dataset group as an existing event tracker.

       When you create an event tracker, the response includes a tracking  ID,
       which  you  pass  as  a parameter when you use the PutEvents operation.
       Amazon Personalize then appends the  event  data  to  the  Interactions
       dataset of the dataset group you specify in your event tracker.

       The event tracker can be in one of the following states:

       o CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

       o DELETE PENDING > DELETE IN_PROGRESS

       To get the status of the event tracker, call DescribeEventTracker .

       NOTE:
              The  event  tracker must be in the ACTIVE state before using the
              tracking ID.

SYNOPSIS
            create-event-tracker
          --name <value>
          --dataset-group-arn <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name for the event tracker.

       --dataset-group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset  group  that  receives
          the event data.

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags to apply to the event tracker.

          (structure)
              The  optional  metadata  that you apply to resources to help you
              categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and  an
              optional  value,  both of which you define. For more information
              see Tagging Personalize resources .

              tagKey -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A key is  a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              tagValue -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag.  A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          tagKey=string,tagValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "tagKey": "string",
              "tagValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       eventTrackerArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the event tracker.

       trackingId -> (string)
          The ID of the event tracker. Include this  ID  in  requests  to  the
          PutEvents API.
