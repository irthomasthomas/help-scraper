CREATE-RECOMMENDER()                                      CREATE-RECOMMENDER()



NAME
       create-recommender -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a recommender with the recipe (a Domain dataset group use case)
       you specify. You create recommenders for a  Domain  dataset  group  and
       specify  the  recommender's  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) when you make a
       GetRecommendations request.
          Minimum recommendation requests per second

       WARNING:
          A high minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond will increase  your  bill.
          We  recommend starting with 1 for minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond
          (the default). Track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and
          increase the minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond as necessary.

       When you create a recommender, you can configure the recommender's min-
       imum recommendation requests per second. The minimum recommendation re-
       quests  per  second (minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond ) specifies the
       baseline recommendation request throughput provisioned by  Amazon  Per-
       sonalize.  The default minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond is 1 . A rec-
       ommendation request is a single GetRecommendations  operation.  Request
       throughput  is  measured  in requests per second and Amazon Personalize
       uses your requests per second to derive your requests per hour and  the
       price of your recommender usage.

       If  your  requests  per  second  increases  beyond minRecommendationRe-
       questsPerSecond , Amazon Personalize auto-scales the provisioned capac-
       ity  up  and down, but never below minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond .
       There's a short time delay while the capacity is increased  that  might
       cause loss of requests.

       Your bill is the greater of either the minimum requests per hour (based
       on minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond) or  the  actual  number  of  re-
       quests. The actual request throughput used is calculated as the average
       requests/second within a one-hour window. We  recommend  starting  with
       the default minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond , track your usage using
       Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and then increase  the  minRecommendationRe-
       questsPerSecond as necessary.
          Status

       A recommender can be in one of the following states:

       o CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

       o STOP  PENDING  >  STOP IN_PROGRESS > INACTIVE > START PENDING > START
         IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE

       o DELETE PENDING > DELETE IN_PROGRESS

       To get the recommender status, call DescribeRecommender .

       NOTE:
              Wait until the status of the recommender is ACTIVE before asking
              the recommender for recommendations.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the recommender.

       --dataset-group-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the destination domain dataset
          group for the recommender.

       --recipe-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recipe  that  the  recommender
          will  use. For a recommender, a recipe is a Domain dataset group use
          case. Only Domain dataset group use cases can be used  to  create  a
          recommender.  For  information  about  use cases see Choosing recom-
          mender use cases .

       --recommender-config (structure)
          The configuration details of the recommender.

          itemExplorationConfig -> (map)
              Specifies the exploration configuration hyperparameters, includ-
              ing explorationWeight and explorationItemAgeCutOff , you want to
              use to configure the amount of item exploration Amazon Personal-
              ize  uses when recommending items. Provide itemExplorationConfig
              data only if your recommenders generate personalized recommenda-
              tions for a user (not popular items or similar items).

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  requested minimum provisioned recommendation re-
              quests per second that Amazon Personalize will support.  A  high
              minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond  will  increase your bill. We
              recommend starting with 1 for minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond
              (the default). Track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics,
              and increase the  minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond  as  neces-
              sary.

          trainingDataConfig -> (structure)
              Specifies the training data configuration to use when creating a
              domain recommender.

              excludedDatasetColumns -> (map)
                 Specifies the columns to exclude from training. Each key is a
                 dataset  type,  and  each value is a list of columns. Exclude
                 columns to control what data Amazon Personalize uses to  gen-
                 erate  recommendations.  For example, you might have a column
                 that you want to use only to filter recommendations. You  can
                 exclude this column from training and Amazon Personalize con-
                 siders it only when filtering.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (list)
                     (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          itemExplorationConfig={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond=integer,trainingDataConfig={excludedDatasetColumns={KeyName1=[string,string],KeyName2=[string,string]}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "itemExplorationConfig": {"string": "string"
              ...},
            "minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond": integer,
            "trainingDataConfig": {
              "excludedDatasetColumns": {"string": ["string", ...]
                ...}
            }
          }

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags to apply to the recommender.

          (structure)
              The optional metadata that you apply to resources  to  help  you
              categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an
              optional value, both of which you define. For  more  information
              see Tagging Amazon Personalize recources .

              tagKey -> (string)
                 One  part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              tagValue -> (string)
                 The  optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          tagKey=string,tagValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "tagKey": "string",
              "tagValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
