LIST-DATA-DELETION-JOBS()                            LIST-DATA-DELETION-JOBS()



NAME
       list-data-deletion-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  data deletion jobs for a dataset group ordered by
       creation time, with the most recent first. When a dataset group is  not
       specified,  all  the data deletion jobs associated with the account are
       listed. The response provides the properties for  each  job,  including
       the  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN). For more information on data deletion
       jobs, see Deleting users .

OPTIONS
       --dataset-group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset  group  to  list  data
          deletion jobs for.

       --next-token (string)
          A  token returned from the previous call to ListDataDeletionJobs for
          getting the next set of jobs (if they exist).

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of data deletion jobs to return.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the data deletion job.

                 A data deletion job can have one of the following statuses:
