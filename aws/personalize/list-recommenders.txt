LIST-RECOMMENDERS()                                        LIST-RECOMMENDERS()



NAME
       list-recommenders -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of recommenders in a given Domain dataset group. When a
       Domain dataset group is not specified, all the recommenders  associated
       with  the  account are listed. The response provides the properties for
       each recommender, including the Amazon Resource Name  (ARN).  For  more
       information on recommenders, see CreateRecommender .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-recommenders  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: recommenders

OPTIONS
       --dataset-group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Domain dataset group  to  list
          the  recommenders for. When a Domain dataset group is not specified,
          all the recommenders associated with the account are listed.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       recommenders -> (list)
          A list of the recommenders.

          (structure)
              Provides a summary of the properties of the recommender.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the recommender.

              recommenderArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recommender.

              datasetGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Domain  dataset  group
                 that contains the recommender.

              recipeArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recipe (Domain dataset
                 group use case) that the recommender was created for.

              recommenderConfig -> (structure)
                 The configuration details of the recommender.

                 itemExplorationConfig -> (map)
                     Specifies the exploration configuration  hyperparameters,
                     including  explorationWeight and explorationItemAgeCutOff
                     , you want to use to configure the amount of item  explo-
                     ration  Amazon  Personalize uses when recommending items.
                     Provide itemExplorationConfig data only  if  your  recom-
                     menders  generate personalized recommendations for a user
                     (not popular items or similar items).

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond -> (integer)
                     Specifies the requested minimum  provisioned  recommenda-
                     tion  requests  per  second  that Amazon Personalize will
                     support. A high  minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond  will
                     increase your bill. We recommend starting with 1 for min-
                     RecommendationRequestsPerSecond (the default). Track your
                     usage  using  Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and increase the
                     minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond as necessary.

                 trainingDataConfig -> (structure)
                     Specifies the training data  configuration  to  use  when
                     creating a domain recommender.

                     excludedDatasetColumns -> (map)
                        Specifies  the  columns to exclude from training. Each
                        key is a dataset type, and each value  is  a  list  of
                        columns.  Exclude  columns to control what data Amazon
                        Personalize uses to generate recommendations. For  ex-
                        ample,  you  might  have a column that you want to use
                        only to filter recommendations. You can  exclude  this
                        column  from training and Amazon Personalize considers
                        it only when filtering.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (list)
                            (string)

                 enableMetadataWithRecommendations -> (boolean)
                     Whether metadata with recommendations is enabled for  the
                     recommender. If enabled, you can specify the columns from
                     your Items dataset in your request  for  recommendations.
                     Amazon Personalize returns this data for each item in the
                     recommendation response. For information  about  enabling
                     metadata for a recommender, see Enabling metadata in rec-
                     ommendations for a recommender .

                     If you enable metadata in recommendations, you will incur
                     additional  costs.  For more information, see Amazon Per-
                     sonalize pricing .

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the recommender. A recommender can be in one of
                 the following states:

              creationDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and time (in Unix format) that the recommender was
                 created.

              lastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time (in Unix format) that the  recommender  was
                 last updated.

       nextToken -> (string)
