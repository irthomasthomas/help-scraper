OPTIONS
       --solution-version-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the solution version.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                     The numerical metadata column in an Items dataset related
                     to  the optimization objective. For example, VIDEO_LENGTH
                     (to maximize streaming minutes), or  PRICE  (to  maximize
                     revenue).

                     Specifies  how Amazon Personalize balances the importance
                     of your optimization objective versus relevance.

              trainingDataConfig -> (structure)
                 Specifies the training data configuration to use when  creat-
                 ing a custom solution version (trained model).

                     is a dataset type, and each value is a list  of  columns.
                     Exclude  columns  to control what data Amazon Personalize
                     uses to generate recommendations. For example, you  might
                     have  a column that you want to use only to filter recom-
                     mendations. You can exclude this column from training and
                     Amazon Personalize considers it only when filtering.

          trainingHours -> (double)
              The time used to train the model. You are billed for the time it
              takes to train a model. This field is visible only after  Amazon
              Personalize successfully trains a model.

          trainingMode -> (string)
              The scope of training to be performed when creating the solution
              version. The FULL option trains the solution  version  based  on
              the  entirety  of  the input solution's training data, while the
              UPDATE option processes only the data that has changed  in  com-
              parison  to  the  input solution. Choose UPDATE when you want to
              incrementally update your solution version instead  of  creating
              an entirely new one.

              WARNING:
                 The  UPDATE  option can only be used when you already have an
                 active solution version created from the input solution using
                 the  FULL  option and the input solution was trained with the
                 User-Personalization recipe or the HRNN-Coldstart recipe.

                 model.

                 value -> (string)

          status -> (string)
              The status of the solution version.

              A solution version can be in one of the following states:

              o CREATE PENDING

              o CREATE IN_PROGRESS

              o ACTIVE

              o CREATE FAILED

              o CREATE STOPPING

              o CREATE STOPPED

          failureReason -> (string)
              If training a solution version fails, the reason for  the  fail-
              ure.

          creationDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time (in Unix time) that this version of the solu-
              tion was created.

          lastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time (in Unix time) that the solution was last  up-
              dated.
