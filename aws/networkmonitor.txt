DESCRIPTION
       Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitor is an Amazon Web Services active net-
       work monitoring service that identifies  if  a  network  issues  exists
       within  the  Amazon  Web  Services network or your own company network.
       Within Network Monitor you'll choose the source VPCs and  subnets  from
       the  Amazon  Web  Services network in which you operate and then you'll
       choose the destination IP addresses from your on-premises network. From
       these  sources and destinations, Network Monitor creates a monitor con-
       taining all the possible source and destination combinations,  each  of
       which  is  called  a  probe, within a single monitor. These probes then
       monitor network traffic to help you identify where network issues might
       be affecting your traffic.
