OPT-OUT-SPEAKER()                                            OPT-OUT-SPEAKER()



NAME
       opt-out-speaker -

DESCRIPTION
       Opts out a speaker from Voice ID. A speaker can be opted out regardless
       of whether or not they already exist in Voice ID. If they don't yet ex-
       ist,  a  new  speaker is created in an opted out state. If they already
       exist, their existing status is overridden and they are opted out.  En-
       rollment  and evaluation authentication requests are rejected for opted
       out speakers, and opted out speakers have no voice embeddings stored in
       Voice ID.

OPTIONS
       --domain-id (string)
          The identifier of the domain that contains the speaker.

       --speaker-id (string)
          The identifier of the speaker you want opted-out.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
