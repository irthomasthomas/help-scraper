NAME
       list-fraudster-registration-jobs -

DESCRIPTION

       JobStatus . If JobStatus is not provided, this lists all fraudster reg-
       istration jobs in the given domain.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-fraudster-registration-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: JobSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-fraudster-registration-jobs
          --domain-id <value>
          [--job-status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-id (string)
          The identifier of the domain containing the  fraudster  registration
          Jobs.

       --job-status (string)
          Provides the status of your fraudster registration job.

          Possible values:

          o SUBMITTED

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o COMPLETED

          o COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS

          o FAILED

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       JobSummaries -> (list)
          A  list  containing details about each specified fraudster registra-
          tion job.

          (structure)
              Contains a summary of information about a fraudster registration
              job.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 A  timestamp  showing  when the fraudster registration job is
                 created.

              DomainId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the domain containing the fraudster  regis-
                 tration job.

              EndedAt -> (timestamp)
                 A  timestamp  showing  when  the  fraudster  registration job
                 ended.

              FailureDetails -> (structure)
                 Contains details that are populated when an entire batch  job
                 fails.  In cases of individual registration job failures, the
                 batch job as a whole doesn't fail; it  is  completed  with  a
                 JobStatus of COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS . You can use the job out-
                 put file to identify  the  individual  registration  requests
                 that failed.

                 Message -> (string)
                     A  description  of  the  error  that caused the batch job
                     failure.

                 StatusCode -> (integer)
                     An HTTP status code representing the nature of the error.

              JobId -> (string)
                 The service-generated identifier for the fraudster  registra-
                 tion job.

              JobName -> (string)
                 The client-provied name for the fraudster registration job.

              JobProgress -> (structure)
                 Shows  the  completed  percentage  of  registration  requests
                 listed in the input file.

                 PercentComplete -> (integer)
                     Shows the completed percentage of enrollment or registra-
                     tion requests listed in the input file.

              JobStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of the fraudster registration job.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  NextToken  is  returned,  there  are more results available. The
          value of NextToken is a unique pagination token for each page.  Make
          the  call  again using the returned token to retrieve the next page.
          Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each  pagination  token  expires
          after 24 hours.
