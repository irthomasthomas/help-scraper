LIST-DOMAINS()                                                  LIST-DOMAINS()



NAME
       list-domains -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all the domains in the Amazon Web Services account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-domains is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: DomainSummaries

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       DomainSummaries -> (list)
          A list containing details about each domain in the Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices account.

          (structure)
              Contains a summary of information about a domain.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the domain.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp showing when the domain is created.

              Description -> (string)
                 The client-provided description of the domain.

              DomainId -> (string)
                 The service-generated identifier for the domain.

              DomainStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of the domain.

              Name -> (string)
                 The client-provided name for the domain.

              ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  server-side  encryption configuration containing the KMS
                 key identifier you want Voice ID to use to encrypt your data.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     The identifier of the KMS key  to  use  to  encrypt  data
                     stored  by  Voice ID. Voice ID doesn't support asymmetric
                     customer managed keys.

              ServerSideEncryptionUpdateDetails -> (structure)
                 Details about the most recent server-side encryption configu-
                 ration  update. When the server-side encryption configuration
                 is changed, dependency on the old KMS key is removed  through
                 an  asynchronous  process.  When this update is complete, the
                 domain's data can only be accessed using the new KMS key.

                 Message -> (string)
                     Message explaining the current UpdateStatus. When the Up-
                     dateStatus  is FAILED, this message explains the cause of
                     the failure.

                 OldKmsKeyId -> (string)
                     The previous KMS key ID the domain  was  encrypted  with,
                     before ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration was updated to a
                     new KMS key ID.

                 UpdateStatus -> (string)
                     Status of the server-side encryption  update.  During  an
                     update, if there is an issue with the domain's current or
                     old KMS key ID, such as an inaccessible or disabled  key,
                     then  the status is FAILED. In order to resolve this, the
                     key needs to be made accessible, and then an UpdateDomain
                     call  with the existing server-side encryption configura-
                     tion will re-attempt this update process.

              UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp showing the domain's last update.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If NextToken is returned, there  are  more  results  available.  The
          value  of NextToken is a unique pagination token for each page. Make
          the call again using the returned token to retrieve the  next  page.
          Keep  all  other  arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires
          after 24 hours.
