OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. If not provided, the Amazon Web Services
          SDK  populates  this  field. For more information about idempotency,
          see Making retries safe with idempotent APIs .

       --data-access-role-arn (string)
          The IAM role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that grants Voice ID permis-
          sions  to  access customer's buckets to read the input manifest file
          and write the job output file. Refer to Batch enrollment using audio
          data from prior calls for the permissions needed in this role.

       --domain-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the domain that contains the speaker enrollment
          job and in which the speakers are enrolled.

       --enrollment-config (structure)
          The enrollment config that contains details such as  the  action  to
          take  when  a  speaker  is  already  enrolled  in Voice ID or when a
          speaker is identified as a fraudster.

          ExistingEnrollmentAction -> (string)
              The action to take when the specified  speaker  is  already  en-
              rolled  in  the  specified  domain.  The default value is SKIP ,
              which skips the enrollment for the existing speaker. Setting the
              value  to  OVERWRITE  replaces the existing voice prints and en-
              rollment audio stored for that speaker with new  data  generated
              from the latest audio.

          FraudDetectionConfig -> (structure)
              The fraud detection configuration to use for the speaker enroll-
              ment job.

              FraudDetectionAction -> (string)
                 The action to take when the given speaker is flagged  by  the
                 fraud  detection  system.  The  default value is FAIL , which
                 fails the speaker enrollment. Changing this value  to  IGNORE
                 results  in  the  speaker  being  enrolled  even  if they are
                 flagged by the fraud detection system.

              RiskThreshold -> (integer)
                 Threshold value for determining whether the speaker is a high
                 risk  to be fraudulent. If the detected risk score calculated
                 by Voice ID is greater than or equal to  the  threshold,  the
                 speaker is considered a fraudster.

              WatchlistIds -> (list)
                 The identifier of watchlists against which fraud detection is
                 performed.

              The  S3  location  for the input manifest file that contains the
              list of individual enrollment or registration job requests.

       Shorthand Syntax:

       --output-data-config (structure)
          The output data config containing the S3  location  where  Voice  ID
          writes  the  job  output file; you must also include a KMS key ID to
          encrypt the file.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              The identifier of the KMS key you want Voice ID to  use  to  en-
              crypt the output file of a speaker enrollment job/fraudster reg-
              istration job.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              The S3 path of the folder where Voice ID writes the  job  output
              file.  It  has a *.out extension. For example, if the input file
              name is input-file.json and the output folder path is  s3://out-
              put-bucket/output-folder   ,   the  full  output  file  path  is
              s3://output-bucket/output-folder/job-Id/input-file.json.out .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KmsKeyId=string,S3Uri=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "KmsKeyId": "string",
            "S3Uri": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                 enrollment audio stored for that speaker with new data gener-
                 ated from the latest audio.

              failed.

              Message -> (string)
                 A description of the error that caused the batch job failure.

                 Shows  the completed percentage of enrollment or registration
                 requests listed in the input file.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the speaker enrollment job.

                 The S3 path of the folder where Voice ID writes the job  out-
                 put file. It has a *.out extension. For example, if the input
                 file name is input-file.json and the output  folder  path  is
                 s3://output-bucket/output-folder  , the full output file path
                 is                s3://output-bucket/output-folder/job-Id/in-
