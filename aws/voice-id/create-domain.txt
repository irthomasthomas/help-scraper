       as speakers, fraudsters, customer audio, and voiceprints. Every  domain
       is created with a default watchlist that fraudsters can be a part of.

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. If not provided, the Amazon Web Services
          SDK  populates  this  field. For more information about idempotency,
          see Making retries safe with idempotent APIs .

       --description (string)
          A brief description of this domain.

       --name (string)
          The name of the domain.

       --server-side-encryption-configuration (structure)
          The configuration, containing the KMS key identifier, to be used  by
          Voice  ID  for  the  server-side  encryption  of your data. Refer to
          Amazon Connect Voice ID encryption at rest for more details  on  how
          the KMS key is used.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              The  identifier  of the KMS key to use to encrypt data stored by
              Voice ID. Voice ID doesn't support asymmetric  customer  managed
              keys.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KmsKeyId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "KmsKeyId": "string"
          }

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags you want added to the domain.

          (structure)
              The tags used to organize, track, or control access for this re-
              source.    For    example,    {    "tags":     {"key1":"value1",
              "key2":"value2"} }.

              Key -> (string)
                 The  first  part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For example, in the tag  'Depart-
                 ment':'Sales', the key is 'Department'.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For example, in the tag  'Depart-
                 ment':'Sales', the value is 'Sales'.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       Domain -> (structure)
          Information about the newly created domain.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the domain.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp of when the domain was created.

          Description -> (string)
              The description of the domain.

          DomainId -> (string)
              The identifier of the domain.

          DomainStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the domain.

          Name -> (string)
              The name for the domain.

          ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              The server-side encryption configuration containing the KMS  key
              identifier you want Voice ID to use to encrypt your data.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of the KMS key to use to encrypt data stored
                 by Voice ID. Voice ID  doesn't  support  asymmetric  customer
                 managed keys.

          ServerSideEncryptionUpdateDetails -> (structure)
              Details  about the most recent server-side encryption configura-
              tion update. When the server-side  encryption  configuration  is
              changed,  dependency  on  the  old KMS key is removed through an
              asynchronous process. When this update is complete, the domain's
              data can only be accessed using the new KMS key.

              Message -> (string)
                 Message  explaining the current UpdateStatus. When the Updat-
                 eStatus is FAILED, this message explains  the  cause  of  the
                 failure.

              OldKmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The previous KMS key ID the domain was encrypted with, before
                 ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration was updated to  a  new  KMS
                 key ID.

              UpdateStatus -> (string)
                 Status  of  the  server-side encryption update. During an up-
                 date, if there is an issue with the domain's current  or  old
                 KMS key ID, such as an inaccessible or disabled key, then the
                 status is FAILED. In order to resolve this, the key needs  to
                 be  made  accessible,  and then an UpdateDomain call with the
                 existing server-side encryption configuration will re-attempt
                 this update process.

          UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp of when the domain was last update.

          WatchlistDetails -> (structure)
              The  watchlist  details of a domain. Contains the default watch-
              list ID of the domain.

              DefaultWatchlistId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the default watchlist.
