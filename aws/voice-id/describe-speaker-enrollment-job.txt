OPTIONS
       --domain-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the domain that contains the speaker enrollment
          job.

       --job-id (string)
          The identifier of the speaker enrollment job you are describing.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       Job -> (structure)
          Contains details about the specified speaker enrollment job.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp of when the speaker enrollment job was created.

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The IAM role Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  that  grants  Voice  ID
              permissions to access customer's buckets to read the input mani-
              fest file and write the job output file.

          DomainId -> (string)
              The identifier of the domain that contains the  speaker  enroll-
              ment job.

          EndedAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp of when the speaker enrollment job ended.

          EnrollmentConfig -> (structure)
              The  configuration  that  defines  the  action  to take when the
              speaker is already enrolled in Voice ID, and the FraudDetection-
              Config to use.

              ExistingEnrollmentAction -> (string)
                 The  action to take when the specified speaker is already en-
                 rolled in the specified domain. The default value is  SKIP  ,
                 which  skips the enrollment for the existing speaker. Setting
                 the value to OVERWRITE replaces the existing voice prints and
                 enrollment audio stored for that speaker with new data gener-
                 ated from the latest audio.

              FraudDetectionConfig -> (structure)
                 The fraud detection configuration to use for the speaker  en-
                 rollment job.

                 FraudDetectionAction -> (string)
                     The  action  to take when the given speaker is flagged by
                     the fraud detection system. The default value is  FAIL  ,
                     which  fails  the speaker enrollment. Changing this value
                     to IGNORE results in the speaker being enrolled  even  if
                     they are flagged by the fraud detection system.

                 RiskThreshold -> (integer)
                     Threshold  value for determining whether the speaker is a
                     high risk to be fraudulent. If the  detected  risk  score
                     calculated  by  Voice  ID is greater than or equal to the
                     threshold, the speaker is considered a fraudster.

                 WatchlistIds -> (list)
                     The identifier of watchlists against which  fraud  detec-
                     tion is performed.

                     (string)

          FailureDetails -> (structure)
              Contains  details  that  are  populated when an entire batch job
              fails. In cases of individual  registration  job  failures,  the
              batch  job  as a whole doesn't fail; it is completed with a Job-
              Status of COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS . You can  use  the  job  output
              file  to  identify  the  individual  registration  requests that
              failed.

              Message -> (string)
                 A description of the error that caused the batch job failure.

              StatusCode -> (integer)
                 An HTTP status code representing the nature of the error.

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The input data config containing an S3 URI for the  input  mani-
              fest  file  that contains the list of speaker enrollment job re-
              quests.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The S3 location for the input manifest file that contains the
                 list of individual enrollment or registration job requests.

          JobName -> (string)
              The client-provided name for the speaker enrollment job.

          JobProgress -> (structure)
              Provides details on job progress. This field shows the completed
              percentage of registration requests listed in the input file.

              PercentComplete -> (integer)
                 Shows the completed percentage of enrollment or  registration
                 requests listed in the input file.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the speaker enrollment job.

          OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The output data config containing the S3 location where Voice ID
              writes the job output file; you must also include a KMS  key  ID
              to encrypt the file.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the KMS key you want Voice ID to use to en-
                 crypt the output file of a speaker  enrollment  job/fraudster
                 registration job.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The  S3 path of the folder where Voice ID writes the job out-
                 put file. It has a *.out extension. For example, if the input
                 file  name  is  input-file.json and the output folder path is
                 s3://output-bucket/output-folder , the full output file  path
                 is                s3://output-bucket/output-folder/job-Id/in-
                 put-file.json.out .
