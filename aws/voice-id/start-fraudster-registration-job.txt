OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          The idempotency token for starting a new fraudster registration job.
          If not provided, Amazon Web Services SDK populates this field.

       --data-access-role-arn (string)
          The IAM role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that grants Voice ID permis-
          sions  to  access customer's buckets to read the input manifest file
          and write the Job output file. Refer to the Create and edit a fraud-
          ster  watchlist  documentation  for  the  permissions needed in this
          role.

       --domain-id (string)
          The identifier of the domain containing the  fraudster  registration
          job and in which the fraudsters are registered.

       --input-data-config (structure)
          The  input  data  config containing an S3 URI for the input manifest
          file that contains the list of fraudster registration requests.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              The S3 location for the input manifest file  that  contains  the
              list of individual enrollment or registration job requests.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Uri=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Uri": "string"
          }

       --job-name (string)
          The name of the new fraudster registration job.

       --output-data-config (structure)
          The  output  data  config  containing the S3 location where Voice ID
          writes the job output file; you must also include a KMS  key  ID  to
          encrypt the file.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              the  identifier  of  the KMS key you want Voice ID to use to en-
              crypt the output file of the fraudster registration job.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              The S3 path of the folder where Voice ID writes the  job  output
              file.  It  has a *.out extension. For example, if the input file
              name is input-file.json and the output folder path is  s3://out-
              put-bucket/output-folder   ,   the  full  output  file  path  is
              s3://output-bucket/output-folder/job-Id/input-file.json.out .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KmsKeyId=string,S3Uri=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "KmsKeyId": "string",
            "S3Uri": "string"
          }

       --registration-config (structure)
          The registration config containing details such  as  the  action  to
          take  when  a  duplicate  fraudster  is detected, and the similarity
          threshold to use for detecting a duplicate fraudster.

          DuplicateRegistrationAction -> (string)
              The action to take when a fraudster is identified  as  a  dupli-
              cate.  The  default action is SKIP , which skips registering the
              duplicate fraudster. Setting the value to REGISTER_AS_NEW always
              registers a new fraudster into the specified domain.

          FraudsterSimilarityThreshold -> (integer)
              The  minimum similarity score between the new and old fraudsters
              in order to consider the new fraudster a duplicate.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DuplicateRegistrationAction=string,FraudsterSimilarityThreshold=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DuplicateRegistrationAction": "SKIP"|"REGISTER_AS_NEW",
            "FraudsterSimilarityThreshold": integer
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
