OPTIONS
       --domain-id (string)
          The  identifier for the domain containing the fraudster registration
          job.

       --job-id (string)
          The identifier for the fraudster registration job you  are  describ-
          ing.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

              tion job.

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The  IAM  role  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that grants Voice ID
              permissions to access customer's buckets to read the input mani-

          DomainId -> (string)
              The  identifier of the domain containing the fraudster registra-

              fails.  In  cases  of  individual registration job failures, the
              batch job as a whole doesn't fail; it is completed with  a  Job-
              Status  of  COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS  .  You can use the job output
              file to  identify  the  individual  registration  requests  that
              failed.

              Message -> (string)
                 A description of the error that caused the batch job failure.

                 An HTTP status code representing the nature of the error.

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The  input  data config containing an S3 URI for the input mani-
              fest file that contains the list of fraudster  registration  job
              requests.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The S3 location for the input manifest file that contains the
                 list of individual enrollment or registration job requests.

              Shows  the  completed percentage of registration requests listed
              in the input file.

                 Shows the completed percentage of enrollment or  registration
                 requests listed in the input file.

          JobStatus -> (string)

          OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The output data config containing the S3 location where you want
              Voice ID to write your job output file; you must also include  a
              KMS key ID in order to encrypt the file.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the KMS key you want Voice ID to use to en-
                 crypt the output file of a speaker  enrollment  job/fraudster
                 registration job.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The  S3 path of the folder where Voice ID writes the job out-
                 put file. It has a *.out extension. For example, if the input
                 file  name  is  input-file.json and the output folder path is
                 s3://output-bucket/output-folder , the full output file  path
                 is                s3://output-bucket/output-folder/job-Id/in-
                 put-file.json.out .

          RegistrationConfig -> (structure)
              The registration config containing details such as the action to
              take  when a duplicate fraudster is detected, and the similarity
              threshold to use for detecting a duplicate fraudster.

              DuplicateRegistrationAction -> (string)
                 The action to take when a fraudster is identified as a dupli-
                 cate.  The  default  action is SKIP , which skips registering
                 the duplicate fraudster. Setting the value to REGISTER_AS_NEW
                 always registers a new fraudster into the specified domain.

              FraudsterSimilarityThreshold -> (integer)
                 The  minimum  similarity score between the new and old fraud-
                 sters in order to consider the new fraudster a duplicate.
