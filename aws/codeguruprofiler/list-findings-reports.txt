OPTIONS
       --daily-reports-only | --no-daily-reports-only (boolean)
          A Boolean value indicating whether to only return reports from daily
          profiles. If set to True , only analysis data from daily profiles is
          returned.  If  set to False , analysis data is returned from smaller
          time windows (for example, one hour).

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end time of the profile to get analysis  data  about.  You  must
          specify startTime and endTime . This is specified using the ISO 8601
          format. For example, 2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z represents 1 millisec-
          ond past June 1, 2020 1:15:02 PM UTC.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of report results returned by ListFindingsReports
          in paginated output. When this parameter  is  used,  ListFindingsRe-
          ports  only returns maxResults results in a single page along with a
          nextToken response element. The remaining results of the initial re-
          quest  can  be  seen  by sending another ListFindingsReports request
          with the returned nextToken value.

       --next-token (string)
          The nextToken value returned from  a  previous  paginated  ListFind-
          ingsReportsRequest request where maxResults was used and the results
          exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from  the
          end of the previous results that returned the nextToken value.

          NOTE:
              This  token  should  be  treated as an opaque identifier that is
              only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other
              programmatic purposes.

       --profiling-group-name (string)
          The  name  of  the profiling group from which to search for analysis
          data.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start time of the profile to get analysis data about.  You  must
          specify startTime and endTime . This is specified using the ISO 8601
          format. For example, 2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z represents 1 millisec-
          ond past June 1, 2020 1:15:02 PM UTC.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       findingsReportSummaries -> (list)
          The list of analysis results summaries.

          (structure)
              Information  about  potential recommendations that might be cre-
              ated from the analysis of profiling data.

              id -> (string)
                 The universally unique identifier (UUID) of  the  recommenda-
                 tion report.

              profileEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The end time of the period during which the metric is flagged
                 as anomalous. This is specified using the  ISO  8601  format.
                 For  example, 2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z represents 1 millisec-
                 ond past June 1, 2020 1:15:02 PM UTC.

              profileStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The start time of the profile the  analysis  data  is  about.
                 This  is  specified  using  the ISO 8601 format. For example,
                 2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z represents 1 millisecond  past  June
                 1, 2020 1:15:02 PM UTC.

              profilingGroupName -> (string)
                 The  name  of the profiling group that is associated with the
                 analysis data.

              totalNumberOfFindings -> (integer)
                 The total number of different recommendations that were found
                 by the analysis.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value to include in a future ListFindingsReports re-
          quest. When the results  of  a  ListFindingsReports  request  exceed
          maxResults , this value can be used to retrieve the next page of re-
          sults. This value is null when there are no more results to return.
