OPTIONS
       --daily-reports-only | --no-daily-reports-only (boolean)
          A Boolean value indicating whether to only return reports from daily
          profiles. If set to True , only analysis data from daily profiles is
          returned. If set to False , analysis data is returned  from  smaller
          time windows (for example, one hour).

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  results  returned  by GetFindingsReportAc-
          countSummary in paginated  output.  When  this  parameter  is  used,
          GetFindingsReportAccountSummary only returns maxResults results in a
          single page along with a nextToken response element.  The  remaining
          results  of  the  initial  request  can  be  seen by sending another
          GetFindingsReportAccountSummary request with the returned  nextToken
          value.

       --next-token (string)
          The  nextToken  value  returned  from  a previous paginated GetFind-
          ingsReportAccountSummary request where maxResults was used  and  the
          results  exceeded  the value of that parameter. Pagination continues
          from the end of the previous results  that  returned  the  nextToken
          value.

          NOTE:
              This  token  should  be  treated as an opaque identifier that is
              only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other
              programmatic purposes.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken value to  include  in  a  future  GetFindingsReportAc-
          countSummary  request.  When  the  results of a GetFindingsReportAc-
          countSummary request exceed maxResults , this value can be  used  to
          retrieve the next page of results. This value is null when there are
          no more results to return.

       reportSummaries -> (list)
          The      return      list      of      `       FindingsReportSummary
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/profiler-api/API_FindingsReportSummary.html`__
          objects taht contain summaries of analysis results for all profiling
          groups in your AWS account.

          (structure)
              Information  about  potential recommendations that might be cre-
              ated from the analysis of profiling data.

              id -> (string)
                 The universally unique identifier (UUID) of  the  recommenda-
                 tion report.

              profileEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The end time of the period during which the metric is flagged
                 as anomalous. This is specified using the  ISO  8601  format.
                 For  example, 2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z represents 1 millisec-
                 ond past June 1, 2020 1:15:02 PM UTC.

              profileStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The start time of the profile the  analysis  data  is  about.
                 This  is  specified  using  the ISO 8601 format. For example,
                 2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z represents 1 millisecond  past  June
                 1, 2020 1:15:02 PM UTC.

              profilingGroupName -> (string)
                 The  name  of the profiling group that is associated with the
                 analysis data.

              totalNumberOfFindings -> (integer)
                 The total number of different recommendations that were found
                 by the analysis.
