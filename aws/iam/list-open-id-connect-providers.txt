LIST-OPEN-ID-CONNECT-PROVIDERS()              LIST-OPEN-ID-CONNECT-PROVIDERS()



NAME
       list-open-id-connect-providers -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists information about the IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource
       objects defined in the Amazon Web Services account.

       NOTE:
          IAM resource-listing operations return a subset of the available at-
          tributes  for the resource. For example, this operation does not re-
          turn tags, even though they are an attribute of the returned object.
          To view all of the information for an OIDC provider, see  GetOpenID-
          ConnectProvider .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-open-id-connect-providers
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list information about the OpenID Connect providers in the  AWS  ac-
       count

       This example returns a list of ARNS of all the OpenID Connect providers
       that are defined in the current AWS account:

          aws iam list-open-id-connect-providers

       Output:

          {
            "OpenIDConnectProviderList": [
              {
                "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:oidc-provider/example.oidcprovider.com"
              }
            ]
          }

       For more information, see Using OpenID Connect  Identity  Providers  in
       the Using IAM guide.

OUTPUT
       OpenIDConnectProviderList -> (list)
          The list of IAM OIDC provider resource objects defined in the Amazon
          Web Services account.

          (structure)
              Contains the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an IAM  OpenID  Con-
              nect provider.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN). ARNs are unique identifiers
                 for Amazon Web Services resources.

                 For more information about ARNs, go to Amazon Resource  Names
                 (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .
