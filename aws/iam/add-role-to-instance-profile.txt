ADD-ROLE-TO-INSTANCE-PROFILE()                  ADD-ROLE-TO-INSTANCE-PROFILE()



NAME
       add-role-to-instance-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  the  specified IAM role to the specified instance profile. An in-
       stance profile can contain only one role, and this quota cannot be  in-
       creased. You can remove the existing role and then add a different role
       to an instance profile. You must then wait for  the  change  to  appear
       across  all of Amazon Web Services because of eventual consistency . To
       force the change, you must disassociate the instance profile  and  then
       associate the instance profile , or you can stop your instance and then
       restart it.

       NOTE:
          The caller of this operation must be granted the PassRole permission
          on the IAM role by a permissions policy.

       For more information about roles, see Working with roles . For more in-
       formation about instance profiles, see About instance profiles .

OPTIONS
       --instance-profile-name (string)
          The name of the instance profile to update.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --role-name (string)
          The name of the role to add.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of upper  and  lowercase  alphanumeric  characters
          with  no  spaces.  You can also include any of the following charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To add a role to an instance profile

       The following add-role-to-instance-profile command adds the role  named
       S3Access to the instance profile named Webserver:

          aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile --role-name S3Access --instance-profile-name Webserver

       To create an instance profile, use the create-instance-profile command.
