GET-POLICY-VERSION()                                      GET-POLICY-VERSION()



NAME
       get-policy-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about the specified version of the specified man-
       aged policy, including the policy document.

       NOTE:
          Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded  compliant  with
          RFC  3986  . You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy
          back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you  can  use
          the  decode  method  of the java.net.URLDecoder utility class in the
          Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

       To list the available versions for a policy, use  ListPolicyVersions .

       This operation retrieves information about  managed  policies.  To  re-
       trieve  information  about an inline policy that is embedded in a user,
       group, or role, use  GetUserPolicy ,  GetGroupPolicy , or   GetRolePol-
       icy .

       For  more information about the types of policies, see Managed policies
       and inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

       For more information about managed policy versions, see Versioning  for
       managed policies in the IAM User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --policy-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the managed policy that you want
          information about.

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
          the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --version-id (string)
          Identifies the policy version to retrieve.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters that consists of the lowercase letter 'v' followed by one  or
          two  digits, and optionally followed by a period '.' and a string of
          letters and digits.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve information about the specified version  of  the  specified
       managed policy

       This example returns the policy document for the v2 version of the pol-
       icy whose ARN is arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MyManagedPolicy:

          aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MyPolicy --version-id v2

       Output:

          {
              "PolicyVersion": {
                  "CreateDate": "2015-06-17T19:23;32Z",
                  "VersionId": "v2",
                  "Document": {
                                "Version": "2012-10-17",
                                "Statement": [
                                        {
                                                "Action": "iam:*",
                                                "Resource": "*",
                                                "Effect": "Allow"
                                        }
                                ]
                          }
                  "IsDefaultVersion": "false"
              }
          }

       guide.

OUTPUT
       PolicyVersion -> (structure)
          A structure containing details about the policy version.

          Document -> (string)
              The policy document.

              The policy document is returned in the response to the  GetPoli-
              cyVersion and  GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations. It  is
              not  returned  in  the  response  to the  CreatePolicyVersion or
              ListPolicyVersions operations.

              The policy document returned in this  structure  is  URL-encoded
              compliant  with  RFC 3986 . You can use a URL decoding method to
              convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if  you
              use  Java,  you can use the decode method of the java.net.URLDe-
              coder utility class in the Java SDK. Other  languages  and  SDKs
              provide similar functionality.

          VersionId -> (string)
              The identifier for the policy version.

              Policy  version  identifiers  always begin with v (always lower-
              case). When a policy is created, the first policy version is  v1
              .

          IsDefaultVersion -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether the policy version is set as the policy's de-
              fault version.

          CreateDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the  pol-
              icy version was created.
