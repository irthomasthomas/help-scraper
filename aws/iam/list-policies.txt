LIST-POLICIES()                                                LIST-POLICIES()



NAME
       list-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  the  managed policies that are available in your Amazon Web
       Services account, including your own customer-defined managed  policies
       and all Amazon Web Services managed policies.

       You can filter the list of policies that is returned using the optional
       OnlyAttached , Scope , and PathPrefix parameters. For example, to  list
       only the customer managed policies in your Amazon Web Services account,
       set Scope to Local . To list only Amazon Web Services managed policies,
       set Scope to AWS .

       You can paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker parameters.

       For  more  information about managed policies, see Managed policies and
       inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

       NOTE:
          IAM resource-listing operations return a subset of the available at-
          tributes  for the resource. For example, this operation does not re-
          turn tags, even though they are an attribute of the returned object.
          To  view  all  of  the information for a customer manged policy, see
          GetPolicy .

       list-policies is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Policies

OPTIONS
       --scope (string)
          The scope to use for filtering the results.

          To  list only Amazon Web Services managed policies, set Scope to AWS
          . To list only the customer managed policies in your Amazon Web Ser-
          vices account, set Scope to Local .

          This  parameter  is optional. If it is not included, or if it is set
          to All , all policies are returned.

          Possible values:

          o All

          o AWS

          o Local

       --only-attached | --no-only-attached (boolean)
          A flag to filter the results to only the attached policies.

          When OnlyAttached is true , the  returned  list  contains  only  the
          policies  that  are  attached  to  an IAM user, group, or role. When
          OnlyAttached is false , or when the parameter is not  included,  all
          policies are returned.

       --path-prefix (string)
          The  path  prefix  for  filtering the results. This parameter is op-
          tional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash  (/),  listing
          all  policies.  This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a
          string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by it-
          self  or  a  string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In
          addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the  !  (\u0021  )
          through  the  DEL  character  (\u007F  ), including most punctuation
          characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

       --policy-usage-filter (string)
          The policy usage method to use for filtering the results.

          To list only permissions policies, set PolicyUsageFilter to  Permis-
          sionsPolicy  .  To  list  only  the policies used to set permissions
          boundaries, set the value to PermissionsBoundary .

          This parameter is optional. If it is not included, all policies  are
          returned.

          Possible values:

          o PermissionsPolicy

          o PermissionsBoundary

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list managed policies that are available to your AWS account

       This  example  returns  a  collection of the first two managed policies
       available in the current AWS account.

          aws iam list-policies \
              --max-items 3

OUTPUT
       Policies -> (list)
          A list of policies.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a managed policy.

              This  data type is used as a response element in the  CreatePol-
              icy ,  GetPolicy , and  ListPolicies operations.

              For more information about managed policies,  refer  to  Managed
              policies and inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

              PolicyName -> (string)
                 The friendly name (not ARN) identifying the policy.

              PolicyId -> (string)
                 The stable and unique string identifying the policy.

                 For  more  information  about IDs, see IAM identifiers in the
                 IAM User Guide .

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN). ARNs are  unique  identifiers
                 for Amazon Web Services resources.

                 For  more information about ARNs, go to Amazon Resource Names
                 (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

              Path -> (string)
                 The path to the policy.

                 For more information about paths, see IAM identifiers in  the
                 IAM User Guide .

              DefaultVersionId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  for the version of the policy that is set as
                 the default version.

              AttachmentCount -> (integer)
                 The number of entities (users, groups, and  roles)  that  the
                 policy is attached to.

              PermissionsBoundaryUsageCount -> (integer)
                 The number of entities (users and roles) for which the policy
                 is used to set the permissions boundary.

                 For  more  information  about  permissions  boundaries,   see
                 Permissions  boundaries  for  IAM  identities in the IAM User
                 Guide .

              IsAttachable -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the policy can be attached to an IAM  user,
                 group, or role.

              Description -> (string)
                 A friendly description of the policy.

                 This  element  is  included in the response to the  GetPolicy
                 operation. It is not included in the response to  the   List-
                 Policies operation.

              CreateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the
                 policy was created.

              UpdateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format  ,  when  the
                 policy was last updated.

                 When  a  policy has only one version, this field contains the
                 date and time when the policy was created. When a policy  has
                 more  than one version, this field contains the date and time
                 when the most recent policy version was created.

              Tags -> (list)
                 A list of tags that are attached to the instance profile. For
                 more  information about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in
                 the IAM User Guide .

                 (structure)
                     A structure that represents user-provided  metadata  that
                     can be associated with an IAM resource. For more informa-
                     tion about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the  IAM
                     User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The  key  name that can be used to look up or retrieve
                        the associated value. For example, Department or  Cost
                        Center are common choices.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The  value associated with this tag. For example, tags
                        with a key name of Department could have  values  such
                        as  Human  Resources , Accounting , and Support . Tags
                        with a key name of Cost Center might have values  that
                        consist  of  the  number associated with the different
                        cost centers in  your  company.  Typically,  many  re-
                        sources have tags with the same key name but with dif-
                        ferent values.

                        NOTE:
                            Amazon Web  Services  always  interprets  the  tag
                            Value  as a single string. If you need to store an
                            array, you can store comma-separated values in the
                            string.  However,  you must interpret the value in
                            your code.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more  items  to  return.  If
          your  results  were  truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination
          request using the Marker request parameter to retrieve  more  items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even when there are more results available. We  recommend  that  you
          check  IsTruncated  after  every call to ensure that you receive all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains  the
          value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination re-
          quest.
