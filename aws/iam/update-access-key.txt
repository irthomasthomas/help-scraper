UPDATE-ACCESS-KEY()                                        UPDATE-ACCESS-KEY()



NAME
       update-access-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Changes the status of the specified access key from Active to Inactive,
       or vice versa. This operation can be used to disable a  user's  key  as
       part of a key rotation workflow.

       If  the  UserName is not specified, the user name is determined implic-
       itly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID used  to  sign  the
       request.  If a temporary access key is used, then UserName is required.
       If a long-term key is assigned to the user, then UserName  is  not  re-
       quired.  This operation works for access keys under the Amazon Web Ser-
       vices account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage  Ama-
       zon  Web  Services account root user credentials even if the Amazon Web
       Services account has no associated users.

       For information about rotating keys, see Managing keys and certificates
       in the IAM User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name of the user whose key you want to update.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of upper  and  lowercase  alphanumeric  characters
          with  no  spaces.  You can also include any of the following charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --access-key-id (string)
          The access key ID of the secret access key you want to update.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters that can consist of any upper or lowercased letter or digit.

       --status (string)
          The status you want to assign to the secret access key. Active means
          that the key can be used for programmatic calls to Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices, while Inactive means that the key cannot be used.

          Possible values:

          o Active

          o Inactive

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To activate or deactivate an access key for an IAM user

       The  following  update-access-key command deactivates the specified ac-
       cess key (access key ID and secret access key) for the IAM  user  named
       Bob:

          aws iam update-access-key --access-key-id AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE --status Inactive --user-name Bob

       Deactivating  the key means that it cannot be used for programmatic ac-
       cess to AWS. However, the key is still available  and  can  be  reacti-
       vated.

       For  more  information, see Creating, Modifying, and Viewing User Secu-
       rity Credentials in the Using IAM guide.
