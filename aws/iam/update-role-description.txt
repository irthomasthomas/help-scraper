OPTIONS
       --role-name (string)
          The name of the role that you want to modify.

       --description (string)
          The new description that you want to apply to the specified role.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              specify the duration using the optional DurationSeconds API  pa-
              rameter or duration-seconds CLI parameter.

          PermissionsBoundary -> (structure)
              The  ARN  of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for
              the role.

              For  more  information   about   permissions   boundaries,   see
              Permissions  boundaries for IAM identities in the IAM User Guide

              Guide .

              (structure)
                 A  structure  that represents user-provided metadata that can
                 be associated with an  IAM  resource.  For  more  information
                 about  tagging,  see  Tagging  IAM  resources in the IAM User
                 Guide .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve  the
                     associated  value. For example, Department or Cost Center
                     are common choices.

                 Value -> (string)

                     with  a  key name of Department could have values such as
                     Human Resources , Accounting , and Support . Tags with  a
                     key name of Cost Center might have values that consist of
                     the number associated with the different cost centers  in
                     your  company.  Typically,  many resources have tags with
                     the same key name but with different values.

                     NOTE:
                        Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag Value as
                        a  single  string.  If you need to store an array, you
                        can store comma-separated values in the  string.  How-
                        ever, you must interpret the value in your code.

          RoleLastUsed -> (structure)
              Contains  information  about  the last time that an IAM role was
              used. This includes the date and time and the  Region  in  which
              the role was last used. Activity is only reported for the trail-
              ing 400 days. This period can be shorter if  your  Region  began
              supporting  these  features within the last year. The role might
              have been used more than 400 days ago. For more information, see
              Regions where data is tracked in the IAM user Guide .

              LastUsedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format that the role
                 was last used.

                 This field is null if the role has not been used  within  the
                 IAM  tracking period. For more information about the tracking
                 period, see Regions where data is tracked  in  the  IAM  User
                 Guide .

              Region -> (string)
                 The  name of the Amazon Web Services Region in which the role
                 was last used.
