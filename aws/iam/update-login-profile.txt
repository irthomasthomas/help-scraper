NAME
       update-login-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Changes  the  password for the specified IAM user. You can use the CLI,
       the Amazon Web Services API, or the Users page in the  IAM  console  to
       change  the  password  for  any IAM user. Use  ChangePassword to change
       your own password in the My Security Credentials page in the Amazon Web
       Services Management Console.

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name of the user whose password you want to update.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --password (string)
          The new password for the specified IAM user.

          The  regex  pattern  used  to validate this parameter is a string of
          characters consisting of the following:

          o Any printable ASCII character ranging  from  the  space  character
            (\u0020 ) through the end of the ASCII character range

          o The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
            character set (through \u00FF )

          o The special characters tab (\u0009 ), line  feed  (\u000A  ),  and
            carriage return (\u000D )

          However,  the format can be further restricted by the account admin-
          istrator by setting a password policy on the Amazon Web Services ac-
          count. For more information, see  UpdateAccountPasswordPolicy .

       --password-reset-required | --no-password-reset-required (boolean)
          Allows this new password to be used only once by requiring the spec-
          ified IAM user to set a new password on next sign-in.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update the password for an IAM user

       The  following  update-login-profile command creates a new password for
       the IAM user named Bob.

          aws iam update-login-profile \
              --user-name Bob \
              --password <password>

       This command produces no output.

       To set a password policy for the account, use the  update-account-pass-
       word-policy  command. If the new password violates the account password
       policy, the command returns a PasswordPolicyViolation error.

       If the account password policy allows them to,  IAM  users  can  change
       their own passwords using the change-password command.

       Store  the password in a secure place. If the password is lost, it can-
       not be recovered, and you must create a new one  using  the  create-lo-
       gin-profile command.

       For  more  information, see Managing passwords for IAM users in the AWS
       IAM User Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
