TAG-POLICY()                                                      TAG-POLICY()



NAME
       tag-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  one or more tags to an IAM customer managed policy. If a tag with
       the same key name already exists, then that tag is overwritten with the
       new value.

       A tag consists of a key name and an associated value. By assigning tags
       to your resources, you can do the following:

       o Administrative grouping and discovery - Attach tags to  resources  to
         aid in organization and search. For example, you could search for all
         resources with the key name Project and the value  MyImportantProject
         .  Or  search for all resources with the key name Cost Center and the
         value 41200 .

       o Access control - Include tags in IAM  user-based  and  resource-based
         policies. You can use tags to restrict access to only an IAM customer
         managed policy that has a specified tag  attached.  For  examples  of
         policies that show how to use tags to control access, see Control ac-
         cess using IAM tags in the IAM User Guide .

       NOTE:

          o If any one of the tags is invalid or if  you  exceed  the  allowed
            maximum  number of tags, then the entire request fails and the re-
            source is not created. For more  information  about  tagging,  see
            Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide .

          o Amazon  Web  Services  always interprets the tag Value as a single
            string. If you need to store an array, you can  store  comma-sepa-
            rated  values in the string. However, you must interpret the value
            in your code.

OPTIONS
       --policy-arn (string)
          The ARN of the IAM customer managed policy to which you want to  add
          tags.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of upper  and  lowercase  alphanumeric  characters
          with  no  spaces.  You can also include any of the following charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --tags (list)
          The list of tags that you want to attach to the IAM customer managed
          policy. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value.

          (structure)
              A  structure  that represents user-provided metadata that can be
              associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tag-
              ging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 The  key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the as-
                 sociated value. For example, Department or  Cost  Center  are
                 common choices.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a
                 key name of Department could have values such  as  Human  Re-
                 sources  , Accounting , and Support . Tags with a key name of
                 Cost Center might have values that consist of the number  as-
                 sociated  with  the  different  cost centers in your company.
                 Typically, many resources have tags with the  same  key  name
                 but with different values.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon  Web Services always interprets the tag Value as a
                     single string. If you need to store  an  array,  you  can
                     store  comma-separated values in the string. However, you
                     must interpret the value in your code.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
