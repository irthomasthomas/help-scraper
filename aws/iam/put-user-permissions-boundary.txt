PUT-USER-PERMISSIONS-BOUNDARY()                PUT-USER-PERMISSIONS-BOUNDARY()



NAME
       put-user-permissions-boundary -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  or updates the policy that is specified as the IAM user's permis-
       sions boundary. You can use an Amazon Web Services managed policy or  a
       customer  managed policy to set the boundary for a user. Use the bound-
       ary to control the maximum permissions that the user can have.  Setting
       a  permissions boundary is an advanced feature that can affect the per-
       missions for the user.

       WARNING:
          Policies that are used as permissions boundaries do not provide per-
          missions.  You must also attach a permissions policy to the user. To
          learn how the effective permissions for a user  are  evaluated,  see
          IAM JSON policy evaluation logic in the IAM User Guide.

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name (friendly name, not ARN) of the IAM user for which you want
          to set the permissions boundary.

       --permissions-boundary (string)
          The ARN of the managed policy that is used to  set  the  permissions
          boundary for the user.

          A  permissions  boundary policy defines the maximum permissions that
          identity-based policies can grant to an entity, but does  not  grant
          permissions.  Permissions  boundaries do not define the maximum per-
          missions that a resource-based policy can grant  to  an  entity.  To
          learn  more,  see Permissions boundaries for IAM entities in the IAM
          User Guide .

          For more information about policy types, see Policy types in the IAM
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example  1: To apply a permissions boundary based on a custom policy to
       an IAM user

       The following put-user-permissions-boundary example  applies  a  custom
       policy named intern-boundary as the permissions boundary for the speci-
       fied IAM user.

          aws iam put-user-permissions-boundary \
              --permissions-boundary arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/intern-boundary \
              --user-name intern

       This command produces no output.

       Example 2: To apply a permissions boundary based on an AWS managed pol-
       icy to an IAM user

       The  following  put-user-permissions-boundary  example  applies the AWS
       managed pollicy named PowerUserAccess as the permissions  boundary  for
       the specified IAM user.

          aws iam put-user-permissions-boundary \
              --permissions-boundary arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/PowerUserAccess \
              --user-name developer

       This command produces no output.

       For  more information, see Adding and removing IAM identity permissions
       in the AWS IAM User Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
