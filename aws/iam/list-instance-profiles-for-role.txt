LIST-INSTANCE-PROFILES-FOR-ROLE()            LIST-INSTANCE-PROFILES-FOR-ROLE()



NAME
       list-instance-profiles-for-role -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  instance  profiles  that  have the specified associated IAM
       role. If there are none, the operation returns an empty list. For  more
       information about instance profiles, go to About instance profiles .

       You can paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-instance-profiles-for-role  is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: InstanceProfiles

OPTIONS
       --role-name (string)
          The name of the role to list instance profiles for.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the instance profiles for an IAM role

       The following list-instance-profiles-for-role  command  lists  the  in-
       stance profiles that are associated with the role Test-Role:

                            A structure that represents user-provided metadata
                            that  can  be associated with an IAM resource. For
                            more information about tagging,  see  Tagging  IAM
                            resources in the IAM User Guide .

                            Key -> (string)
                               The key name that can be used to look up or re-
                               trieve the associated value. For  example,  De-
                               partment or Cost Center are common choices.

                            Value -> (string)
                               The  value  associated with this tag. For exam-
                               ple, tags with a key name of  Department  could
                               have  values such as Human Resources , Account-
                               ing , and Support . Tags with  a  key  name  of
                               Cost  Center  might have values that consist of
                               the number associated with the  different  cost
                               centers  in  your  company. Typically, many re-
                               sources have tags with the same  key  name  but
                               with different values.

                               NOTE:
                                   Amazon  Web  Services always interprets the
                                   tag Value as a single string. If  you  need
                                   to store an array, you can store comma-sep-
                                   arated values in the string.  However,  you
                                   must interpret the value in your code.

                     RoleLastUsed -> (structure)
                        Contains  information  about the last time that an IAM
                        role was used. This includes the date and time and the
                        Region  in  which  the role was last used. Activity is
                        only reported for the trailing 400 days.  This  period
                        can  be  shorter if your Region began supporting these
                        features within the last year.  The  role  might  have
                        been  used  more  than 400 days ago. For more informa-
                        tion, see Regions where data is  tracked  in  the  IAM
                        user Guide .

                        LastUsedDate -> (timestamp)
                            The  date  and  time, in ISO 8601 date-time format
                            that the role was last used.

                            This field is null if the role has not  been  used
                            within  the IAM tracking period. For more informa-
                            tion about the tracking period, see Regions  where
                            data is tracked in the IAM User Guide .

                        Region -> (string)
                            The  name  of  the  Amazon  Web Services Region in
                            which the role was last used.

              Tags -> (list)
                 A list of tags that are attached to the instance profile. For
                 more  information about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in
                 the IAM User Guide .

                 (structure)
                     A structure that represents user-provided  metadata  that
                     can be associated with an IAM resource. For more informa-
                     tion about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the  IAM
                     User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The  key  name that can be used to look up or retrieve
                        the associated value. For example, Department or  Cost
                        Center are common choices.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The  value associated with this tag. For example, tags
                        with a key name of Department could have  values  such
                        as  Human  Resources , Accounting , and Support . Tags
                        with a key name of Cost Center might have values  that
                        consist  of  the  number associated with the different
                        cost centers in  your  company.  Typically,  many  re-
                        sources have tags with the same key name but with dif-
                        ferent values.

                        NOTE:
                            Amazon Web  Services  always  interprets  the  tag
                            Value  as a single string. If you need to store an
                            array, you can store comma-separated values in the
                            string.  However,  you must interpret the value in
                            your code.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more  items  to  return.  If
          your  results  were  truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination
          request using the Marker request parameter to retrieve  more  items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even when there are more results available. We  recommend  that  you
          check  IsTruncated  after  every call to ensure that you receive all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains  the
          value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination re-
          quest.
