GET-ROLE-POLICY()                                            GET-ROLE-POLICY()



NAME
       get-role-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  specified  inline policy document that is embedded with
       the specified IAM role.

       NOTE:
          Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded  compliant  with
          RFC  3986  . You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy
          back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you  can  use
          the  decode  method  of the java.net.URLDecoder utility class in the
          Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

       An IAM role can also have managed policies attached to it. To  retrieve
       a managed policy document that is attached to a role, use  GetPolicy to
       determine the policy's default version, then use   GetPolicyVersion  to
       retrieve the policy document.

       For  more  information  about policies, see Managed policies and inline
       policies in the IAM User Guide .

       For more information about roles, see Using roles to  delegate  permis-
       sions and federate identities .

SYNOPSIS
            get-role-policy
          --role-name <value>
          --policy-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --role-name (string)
          The name of the role associated with the policy.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of upper  and  lowercase  alphanumeric  characters
          with  no  spaces.  You can also include any of the following charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --policy-name (string)
          The name of the policy document to get.

          ters: _+=,.@-

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about a policy attached to an IAM role

       The following get-role-policy command gets information about the speci-
       fied policy attached to the role named Test-Role:

          aws iam get-role-policy --role-name Test-Role --policy-name ExamplePolicy

       Output:

          {
            "RoleName": "Test-Role",
            "PolicyDocument": {
                "Statement": [
                    {
                        "Action": [
                            "s3:ListBucket",
                            "s3:Put*",
                            "s3:Get*",
                            "s3:*MultipartUpload*"
                        ],
                        "Resource": "*",
                        "Effect": "Allow",
                        "Sid": "1"
                    }
                ]
            }
            "PolicyName": "ExamplePolicy"
          }

       For more information, see Creating a Role in the Using IAM guide.

OUTPUT
       RoleName -> (string)
          The role the policy is associated with.

       PolicyName -> (string)
          The name of the policy.

       PolicyDocument -> (string)
          The policy document.

          IAM stores policies in JSON format.  However,  resources  that  were
          created  using  CloudFormation  templates  can be formatted in YAML.
          CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON  format  before
          submitting it to IAM.
