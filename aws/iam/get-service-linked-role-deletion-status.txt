GET-SERVICE-LINKED-ROLE-DELETION-STATGET-SERVICE-LINKED-ROLE-DELETION-STATUS()



NAME
       get-service-linked-role-deletion-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  status  of your service-linked role deletion. After you
       use  DeleteServiceLinkedRole to submit a service-linked role for  dele-
       tion,  you  can  use  the  DeletionTaskId parameter in GetServiceLinke-
       dRoleDeletionStatus to check the status of the deletion. If  the  dele-
       tion  fails,  this operation returns the reason that it failed, if that
       information is returned by the service.

OPTIONS
       --deletion-task-id (string)
          The deletion task identifier. This identifier  is  returned  by  the
          DeleteServiceLinkedRole   operation   in  the  format  task/aws-ser-
          vice-role/<service-principal-name>/<role-name>/<task-uuid> .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To check the status of a request to delete a service-linked role

       The following get-service-linked-role-deletion-status example  displays
       the status of a previously request to delete a service-linked role. The
       delete operation occurs asynchronously. When you make the request,  you
       get  a  DeletionTaskId  value  that you provide as a parameter for this
       command.

          aws iam get-service-linked-role-deletion-status --deletion-task-id task/aws-service-role/lex.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForLexBots/1a2b3c4d-1234-abcd-7890-abcdeEXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
            "Status": "SUCCEEDED"
          }

       Guide

OUTPUT
       Status -> (string)
          The status of the deletion.

       Reason -> (structure)
          An  object  that  contains  details  about  the  reason the deletion
          failed.

          Reason -> (string)
              A short description of the reason that the  service-linked  role
              deletion failed.

          RoleUsageList -> (list)
              A list of objects that contains details about the service-linked
              role deletion failure, if that information is  returned  by  the
              service.  If  the  service-linked role has active sessions or if
              any resources that were used by the role have not  been  deleted
              from the linked service, the role can't be deleted. This parame-
              ter includes a list of the resources that  are  associated  with
              the role and the Region in which the resources are being used.

              (structure)
                 An  object  that  contains details about how a service-linked
                 role is used, if that information is returned by the service.

                 This data type is used as a response element in the   GetSer-
                 viceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus operation.

                 Region -> (string)
                     The  name  of the Region where the service-linked role is
                     being used.

                 Resources -> (list)
                     The name of the resource that is using the service-linked
                     role.

                     (string)
                        The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN). ARNs are unique iden-
                        tifiers for Amazon Web Services resources.

                        For more information about ARNs, go to Amazon Resource
                        Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Refer-
                        ence .
