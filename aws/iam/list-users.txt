LIST-USERS()                                                      LIST-USERS()



NAME
       list-users -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  IAM  users  that have the specified path prefix. If no path
       prefix is specified, the operation returns all users in the Amazon  Web
       Services  account.  If  there  are none, the operation returns an empty
       list.

       NOTE:
          IAM resource-listing operations return a subset of the available at-
          tributes  for  the resource. This operation does not return the fol-
          lowing attributes, even though they are an attribute of the returned
          object:

          o PermissionsBoundary

          o Tags

          To view all of the information for a user, see  GetUser .

       You can paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-users  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Users

OPTIONS
       --path-prefix (string)
          The path prefix for  filtering  the  results.  For  example:  /divi-
          sion_abc/subdivision_xyz/  ,  which  would  get all user names whose
          path starts with /division_abc/subdivision_xyz/ .

          This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to  a
          slash  (/),  listing  all user names. This parameter allows (through
          its regex pattern ) a string of characters consisting  of  either  a
          forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with
          forward slashes. In addition, it can  contain  any  ASCII  character
          from  the ! (\u0021 ) through the DEL character (\u007F ), including
          most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and  lowercased  let-
          ters.

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list IAM users

       The following list-users command lists the IAM users in the current ac-
       count:

          aws iam list-users

       Output:

          "Users": [
              {
                  "UserName": "Adele",
                  "Path": "/",
                  "CreateDate": "2013-03-07T05:14:48Z",
                  "UserId": "AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE",
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Adele"
              },
              {
                  "UserName": "Bob",
                  "Path": "/",
                  "CreateDate": "2012-09-21T23:03:13Z",
                  "UserId": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Bob"
              }
          ]

       For more information, see Listing Users in the Using IAM guide.

OUTPUT
       Users -> (list)
          A list of users.

          (structure)
              Contains information about an IAM user entity.

              This  data  type  is used as a response element in the following
              operations:

              o CreateUser

              o GetUser

              o ListUsers

              Path -> (string)
                 The path to the user. For more information about  paths,  see
                 IAM identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

                 The  ARN  of  the policy used to set the permissions boundary
                 for the user.

              UserName -> (string)
                 The friendly name identifying the user.

              UserId -> (string)
                 The stable and unique string identifying the user.  For  more
                 information  about  IDs,  see IAM identifiers in the IAM User
                 Guide .

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the user.  For
                 more  information about ARNs and how to use ARNs in policies,
                 see IAM Identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

              CreateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format  ,  when  the
                 user was created.

              PasswordLastUsed -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the
                 user's password was last used to sign in  to  an  Amazon  Web
                 Services  website. For a list of Amazon Web Services websites
                 that capture a user's last sign-in time, see  the  Credential
                 reports  topic  in the IAM User Guide . If a password is used
                 more than once in a five-minute span, only the first  use  is
                 returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then
                 it indicates that they never signed in with a password.  This
                 can be because:

                 o The user never had a password.

                 o A  password  exists but has not been used since IAM started
                   tracking this information on October 20, 2014.

                 A null value does not mean that the user never  had  a  pass-
                 word.  Also,  if  the user does not currently have a password
                 but had one in the past, then this field  contains  the  date
                 and time the most recent password was used.

                 This  value  is  returned only in the  GetUser and  ListUsers
                 operations.

              PermissionsBoundary -> (structure)
                 For  more  information  about  permissions  boundaries,   see
                 Permissions  boundaries  for  IAM  identities in the IAM User
                 Guide .

                 PermissionsBoundaryType -> (string)
                     The permissions boundary usage type that  indicates  what
                     type  of IAM resource is used as the permissions boundary
                     for an entity. This data type can only have  a  value  of
                     Policy .

                 PermissionsBoundaryArn -> (string)
                     The  ARN of the policy used to set the permissions bound-
                     ary for the user or role.

              Tags -> (list)
                 A list of tags that are associated with the  user.  For  more
                 information  about  tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the
                 IAM User Guide .

                 (structure)
                     A structure that represents user-provided  metadata  that
                     can be associated with an IAM resource. For more informa-
                     tion about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the  IAM
                     User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The  key  name that can be used to look up or retrieve
                        the associated value. For example, Department or  Cost
                        Center are common choices.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The  value associated with this tag. For example, tags
                        with a key name of Department could have  values  such
                        as  Human  Resources , Accounting , and Support . Tags
                        with a key name of Cost Center might have values  that
                        consist  of  the  number associated with the different
                        cost centers in  your  company.  Typically,  many  re-
                        sources have tags with the same key name but with dif-
                        ferent values.

                        NOTE:
                            Amazon Web  Services  always  interprets  the  tag
                            Value  as a single string. If you need to store an
                            array, you can store comma-separated values in the
                            string.  However,  you must interpret the value in
                            your code.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more  items  to  return.  If
          your  results  were  truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination
          request using the Marker request parameter to retrieve  more  items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even when there are more results available. We  recommend  that  you
          check  IsTruncated  after  every call to ensure that you receive all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains  the
          value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination re-
          quest.
