LIST-ATTACHED-USER-POLICIES()                    LIST-ATTACHED-USER-POLICIES()



NAME
       list-attached-user-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all managed policies that are attached to the specified IAM user.

       An IAM user can also have inline policies embedded with it. To list the
       inline policies for a user, use   ListUserPolicies  .  For  information
       about  policies,  see  Managed  policies and inline policies in the IAM
       User Guide .

       You can paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker  parameters.
       You  can  use the PathPrefix parameter to limit the list of policies to
       only those matching the specified path prefix. If there are no policies
       attached  to the specified group (or none that match the specified path
       prefix), the operation returns an empty list.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-attached-user-policies is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: AttachedPolicies

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name (friendly name, not ARN) of the user to list attached poli-
          cies for.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --path-prefix (string)
          The  path  prefix  for  filtering the results. This parameter is op-
          tional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash  (/),  listing
          all policies.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of either a forward  slash  (/)  by  itself  or  a
          string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it
          can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021 ) through the DEL
          character  (\u007F ), including most punctuation characters, digits,
          and upper and lowercased letters.

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list all managed policies that are attached to the specified user

       This command returns the names and ARNs of the managed policies for the
       IAM user named Bob in the AWS account.

          aws iam list-attached-user-policies \
              --user-name Bob

       Output:

          {
              "AttachedPolicies": [
                  {
                      "PolicyName": "AdministratorAccess",
                      "PolicyArn": "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess"
                  },
                  {
                      "PolicyName": "SecurityAudit",
                      "PolicyArn": "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/SecurityAudit"
                  }
              ],
              "IsTruncated": false
          }

       For more information, see Policies and permissions in IAM  in  the  AWS
       IAM User Guide.

OUTPUT
       AttachedPolicies -> (list)
          A list of the attached policies.

          (structure)
              Contains information about an attached policy.

              An attached policy is a managed policy that has been attached to
              a user, group, or role. This data type is used as a response el-
              ement in the  ListAttachedGroupPolicies ,  ListAttachedRolePoli-
              cies ,  ListAttachedUserPolicies , and  GetAccountAuthorization-
              Details operations.

              For  more  information  about managed policies, refer to Managed
              policies and inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

              PolicyName -> (string)
                 The friendly name of the attached policy.

              PolicyArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN). ARNs are  unique  identifiers
                 for Amazon Web Services resources.

                 For  more information about ARNs, go to Amazon Resource Names
                 (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more  items  to  return.  If
          your  results  were  truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination
          request using the Marker request parameter to retrieve  more  items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even when there are more results available. We  recommend  that  you
          check  IsTruncated  after  every call to ensure that you receive all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains  the
          value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination re-
          quest.
