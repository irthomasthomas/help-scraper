UPDATE-GROUP()                                                  UPDATE-GROUP()



NAME
       update-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the name and/or the path of the specified IAM group.

       WARNING:
          You should understand the implications of changing a group's path or
          name. For more information, see Renaming users and groups in the IAM
          User Guide .

       NOTE:
          The  person making the request (the principal), must have permission
          to change the role group with the old name and the new name. For ex-
          ample,  to  change  the group named Managers to MGRs , the principal
          must have a policy that allows them to update both  groups.  If  the
          principal  has  permission to update the Managers group, but not the
          MGRs group, then the update fails. For more information  about  per-
          missions, see Access management .

OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)
          Name  of the IAM group to update. If you're changing the name of the
          group, this is the original name.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --new-path (string)
          New  path  for  the  IAM  group.  Only  include this if changing the
          group's path.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  either  a  forward  slash (/) by itself or a
          string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it
          can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021 ) through the DEL
          character (\u007F ), including most punctuation characters,  digits,
          and upper and lowercased letters.

       --new-group-name (string)
          New  name  for  the  IAM  group.  Only  include this if changing the
          group's name.

          IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be  unique  within  the
          account.  Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you can-
          not create resources named both "MyResource" and "myresource".

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To rename an IAM group

       The following update-group command changes the name of  the  IAM  group
       Test to Test-1.

          aws iam update-group \
              --group-name Test \
              --new-group-name Test-1

       This command produces no output.
