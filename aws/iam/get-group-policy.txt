GET-GROUP-POLICY()                                          GET-GROUP-POLICY()



NAME
       get-group-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the specified inline policy document that is embedded in the
       specified IAM group.

       NOTE:
          Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded  compliant  with
          RFC  3986  . You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy
          back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you  can  use
          the  decode  method  of the java.net.URLDecoder utility class in the
          Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

       An IAM group can also have managed policies attached to it. To retrieve
       a  managed  policy document that is attached to a group, use  GetPolicy
       to determine the policy's default version, then  use   GetPolicyVersion
       to retrieve the policy document.

       For  more  information  about policies, see Managed policies and inline
       policies in the IAM User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)
          The name of the group the policy is associated with.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --policy-name (string)
          The name of the policy document to get.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of upper  and  lowercase  alphanumeric  characters
          with  no  spaces.  You can also include any of the following charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about a policy attached to an IAM group

       The following get-group-policy command gets information about the spec-
       ified policy attached to the group named Test-Group:

          aws iam get-group-policy --group-name Test-Group --policy-name S3-ReadOnly-Policy

       Output:

          {
              "GroupName": "Test-Group",
              "PolicyDocument": {
                  "Statement": [
                      {
                          "Action": [
                              "s3:Get*",
                              "s3:List*"
                          ],
                          "Resource": "*",
                          "Effect": "Allow"
                      }
                  ]
              },
              "PolicyName": "S3-ReadOnly-Policy"
          }

       For more information, see Managing IAM Policies in the Using IAM guide.

OUTPUT
       GroupName -> (string)
          The group the policy is associated with.

       PolicyName -> (string)
          The name of the policy.

       PolicyDocument -> (string)
          The policy document.

          IAM  stores  policies  in  JSON format. However, resources that were
          created using CloudFormation templates can  be  formatted  in  YAML.
          CloudFormation  always  converts a YAML policy to JSON format before
          submitting it to IAM.
