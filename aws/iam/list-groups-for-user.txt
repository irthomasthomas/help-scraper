LIST-GROUPS-FOR-USER()                                  LIST-GROUPS-FOR-USER()



NAME
       list-groups-for-user -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the IAM groups that the specified IAM user belongs to.

       You can paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-groups-for-user  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Groups

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name of the user to list groups for.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the groups that an IAM user belongs to

       The following list-groups-for-user command displays the groups that the
       IAM user named Bob belongs to.

          aws iam list-groups-for-user \
              --user-name Bob

       Output:

          {
              "Groups": [
                  {
                      "Path": "/",
                      "CreateDate": "2013-05-06T01:18:08Z",
                      "GroupId": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
                      "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:group/Admin",
                      "GroupName": "Admin"
                  },
                  {
                      "Path": "/",
                      "CreateDate": "2013-05-06T01:37:28Z",
                      "GroupId": "AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE",
                      "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:group/s3-Users",
                      "GroupName": "s3-Users"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Groups -> (list)
          A list of groups.

          (structure)
              Contains information about an IAM group entity.

              This data type is used as a response element  in  the  following
              operations:

              o CreateGroup

              o GetGroup

              o ListGroups

              Path -> (string)
                 The  path to the group. For more information about paths, see
                 IAM identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

              GroupName -> (string)
                 The friendly name that identifies the group.

              GroupId -> (string)
                 The stable and unique string identifying the group. For  more
                 information  about  IDs,  see IAM identifiers in the IAM User
                 Guide .

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) specifying the group. For more
                 information  about  ARNs and how to use them in policies, see
                 IAM identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

              CreateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format  ,  when  the
                 group was created.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A  flag  that  indicates  whether there are more items to return. If
          your results were truncated, you can make  a  subsequent  pagination
          request  using  the Marker request parameter to retrieve more items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even  when  there  are more results available. We recommend that you
          check IsTruncated after every call to ensure that  you  receive  all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When  IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains the
          value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination re-
          quest.
