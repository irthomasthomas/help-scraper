UPLOAD-SIGNING-CERTIFICATE()                      UPLOAD-SIGNING-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       upload-signing-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Uploads  an X.509 signing certificate and associates it with the speci-
       fied IAM user. Some Amazon Web Services services  require  you  to  use
       certificates  to validate requests that are signed with a corresponding
       private key. When you upload the certificate, its default status is Ac-
       tive .

       For  information about when you would use an X.509 signing certificate,
       see Managing server certificates in IAM in the IAM User Guide .

       If the UserName is not specified, the IAM user name is  determined  im-
       plicitly  based  on  the Amazon Web Services access key ID used to sign
       the request. This operation works for access keys under the Amazon  Web
       Services  account.  Consequently,  you can use this operation to manage
       Amazon Web Services account root user credentials even  if  the  Amazon
       Web Services account has no associated users.

       NOTE:
          Because  the  body  of an X.509 certificate can be large, you should
          use POST rather than GET when calling UploadSigningCertificate . For
          information  about  setting  up signatures and authorization through
          the API, see Signing Amazon Web Services API requests in the  Amazon
          Web Services General Reference . For general information about using
          the Query API with IAM, see Making query requests in  the  IAM  User
          Guide .

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name of the user the signing certificate is for.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of upper  and  lowercase  alphanumeric  characters
          with  no  spaces.  You can also include any of the following charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --certificate-body (string)
          The contents of the signing certificate.

          The regex pattern used to validate this parameter  is  a  string  of
          characters consisting of the following:

          o Any  printable  ASCII  character  ranging from the space character
            (\u0020 ) through the end of the ASCII character range

          o The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
            character set (through \u00FF )

          o The  special  characters  tab  (\u0009 ), line feed (\u000A ), and
            carriage return (\u000D )

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To upload a signing certificate for an IAM user

       The following upload-signing-certificate command uploads a signing cer-
       tificate for the IAM user named Bob:

          aws iam upload-signing-certificate --user-name Bob --certificate-body file://certificate.pem

       Output:

          {
              "Certificate": {
                  "UserName": "Bob",
                  "Status": "Active",
                  "CertificateBody": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----<certificate-body>-----END CERTIFICATE-----",
                  "CertificateId": "TA7SMP42TDN5Z26OBPJE7EXAMPLE",
                  "UploadDate": "2013-06-06T21:40:08.121Z"
              }
          }

       The certificate is in a file named certificate.pem in PEM format.

       For  more  information,  see Creating and Uploading a User Signing Cer-
       tificate in the Using IAM guide.
