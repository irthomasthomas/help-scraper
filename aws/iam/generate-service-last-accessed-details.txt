GENERATE-SERVICE-LAST-ACCESSED-DETAILSGENERATE-SERVICE-LAST-ACCESSED-DETAILS()



NAME
       generate-service-last-accessed-details -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  a  report  that  includes details about when an IAM resource
       (user, group, role, or policy) was last used in an  attempt  to  access
       Amazon  Web  Services  services. Recent activity usually appears within
       four hours. IAM reports activity for at least the  last  400  days,  or
       less if your Region began supporting this feature within the last year.
       For more information, see Regions where data is tracked . For more  in-
       formation about services and actions for which action last accessed in-
       formation is displayed, see IAM action last accessed  information  ser-
       vices and actions .

       WARNING:
          The  service  last  accessed data includes all attempts to access an
          Amazon Web Services API, not just the successful ones. This includes
          all attempts that were made using the Amazon Web Services Management
          Console, the Amazon Web Services API through any of the SDKs, or any
          of  the  command line tools. An unexpected entry in the service last
          accessed data does not mean that your account has been  compromised,
          because the request might have been denied. Refer to your CloudTrail
          logs as the authoritative source for information about all API calls
          and whether they were successful or denied access. For more informa-
          tion, see Logging IAM events with CloudTrail in the IAM User Guide .

       The GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails operation returns a JobId .  Use
       this  parameter  in  the following operations to retrieve the following
       details from your report:

       o GetServiceLastAccessedDetails  Use this operation for users,  groups,
         roles, or policies to list every Amazon Web Services service that the
         resource could access using permissions policies. For  each  service,
         the  response  includes  information about the most recent access at-
         tempt. The JobId returned by  GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetail  must
         be  used  by the same role within a session, or by the same user when
         used to call GetServiceLastAccessedDetail .

       o GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities   Use  this  operation  for
         groups and policies to list information about the associated entities
         (users or roles) that attempted to access a specific Amazon Web  Ser-
         vices service.

       To  check the status of the GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails request,
       use the JobId parameter in the same operations and test  the  JobStatus
       response parameter.

       For additional information about the permissions policies that allow an
       identity (user, group, or role) to access specific  services,  use  the
       ListPoliciesGrantingServiceAccess operation.

       NOTE:
          Service  last accessed data does not use other policy types when de-
          termining whether a resource could access  a  service.  These  other
          policy  types include resource-based policies, access control lists,
          Organizations policies, IAM permissions boundaries, and  STS  assume
          role  policies.  It  only applies permissions policy logic. For more
          about the evaluation of policy types, see Evaluating policies in the
          IAM User Guide .

       For  more  information about service and action last accessed data, see
       Reducing permissions using service last accessed data in the  IAM  User
       Guide .

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The  ARN  of the IAM resource (user, group, role, or managed policy)
          used to generate information about when the resource was  last  used
          in an attempt to access an Amazon Web Services service.

       --granularity (string)
          The  level  of  detail  that  you  want to generate. You can specify
          whether you want to generate information about the last  attempt  to
          access  services  or actions. If you specify service-level granular-
          ity, this operation generates only service data. If you specify  ac-
          tion-level granularity, it generates service and action data. If you
          don't include this optional parameter, the operation generates  ser-
          vice data.

          Possible values:

          o SERVICE_LEVEL

          o ACTION_LEVEL

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To generate a service access report for a custom policy

       The following generate-service-last-accessed-details example  starts  a
       background job to generate a report that lists the services accessed by
       IAM users and other entities with a custom policy  named  intern-bound-
       ary.  You  can  display  the  report after it is created by running the
       get-service-last-accessed-details command.

          aws iam generate-service-last-accessed-details \
              --arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/intern-boundary

       Output:

          {
              "JobId": "2eb6c2b8-7b4c-3xmp-3c13-03b72c8cdfdc"
          }

       Example 2: To generate a service access report for the AWS managed  Ad-
       ministratorAccess policy

       The  following  generate-service-last-accessed-details example starts a
       background job to generate a report that lists the services accessed by
       IAM  users  and other entities with the AWS managed AdministratorAccess
       policy. You can display the report after it is created by  running  the
       get-service-last-accessed-details command.

          aws iam generate-service-last-accessed-details \
              --arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess

       Output:

          {
              "JobId": "78b6c2ba-d09e-6xmp-7039-ecde30b26916"
          }

       For  more  information,  see Refining permissions in AWS using last ac-
       cessed information in the AWS IAM User Guide.

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          The JobId that you can use in the  GetServiceLastAccessedDetails  or
          GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities  operations. The JobId re-
          turned by GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetail must be used by the same
          role within a session, or by the same user when used to call GetSer-
          viceLastAccessedDetail .
