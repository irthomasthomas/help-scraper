GET-LOGIN-PROFILE()                                        GET-LOGIN-PROFILE()



NAME
       get-login-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the user name for the specified IAM user. A login profile is
       created when you create a password for the user to  access  the  Amazon
       Web Services Management Console. If the user does not exist or does not
       have a password, the operation returns a 404 (NoSuchEntity ) error.

       If you create an IAM user with access to the  console,  the  CreateDate
       reflects the date you created the initial password for the user.

       If  you create an IAM user with programmatic access, and then later add
       a password for the user to access the Amazon  Web  Services  Management
       Console,  the CreateDate reflects the initial password creation date. A
       user with programmatic access does not have a login profile unless  you
       create  a  password for the user to access the Amazon Web Services Man-
       agement Console.

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name of the user whose login profile you want to retrieve.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get password information for an IAM user

       The  following  get-login-profile  command  gets  information about the
       password for the IAM user named Bob:

          aws iam get-login-profile --user-name Bob

       Output:

          {
              "LoginProfile": {
                  "UserName": "Bob",
                  "CreateDate": "2012-09-21T23:03:39Z"
              }
          }

       The get-login-profile command can be used to verify that  an  IAM  user
       has a password. The command returns a NoSuchEntity error if no password
       is defined for the user.

       You cannot view a password using this command. If the password is lost,
       you  can reset the password (update-login-profile) for the user. Alter-
       natively, you can delete the login profile  (delete-login-profile)  for
       the user and then create a new one (create-login-profile).

       For more information, see Managing Passwords in the Using IAM guide.

              The name of the user, which can be used for signing  in  to  the
              Amazon Web Services Management Console.

          CreateDate -> (timestamp)
