CREATE-LOGIN-PROFILE()                                  CREATE-LOGIN-PROFILE()



NAME
       create-login-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a password for the specified IAM user. A password allows an IAM
       user to access Amazon Web Services services through the Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Management Console.

       You  can use the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the Users page in
       the IAM console to create a password for any IAM user. Use  ChangePass-
       word  to  update  your own existing password in the My Security Creden-
       tials page in the Amazon Web Services Management Console.

       For more information about managing passwords, see  Managing  passwords
       in the IAM User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name of the IAM user to create a password for. The user must al-
          ready exist.

          This parameter is optional. If no user name is included, it defaults
          to the principal making the request. When you make this request with
          root user credentials, you must use an AssumeRoot  session  to  omit
          the user name.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of upper  and  lowercase  alphanumeric  characters
          with  no  spaces.  You can also include any of the following charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --password (string)
          The new password for the user.

          This parameter must be omitted when you make  the  request  with  an
          AssumeRoot session. It is required in all other cases.

          The  regex  pattern  that  is  used  to validate this parameter is a
          string of characters. That string can include almost  any  printable
          ASCII  character  from  the  space  (\u0020 ) through the end of the
          ASCII character range (\u00FF  ).  You  can  also  include  the  tab
          (\u0009  ), line feed (\u000A ), and carriage return (\u000D ) char-
          acters. Any of these characters are valid in  a  password.  However,
          many  tools,  such  as  the  Amazon Web Services Management Console,
          might restrict the ability to type certain characters  because  they
          have special meaning within that tool.

       --password-reset-required | --no-password-reset-required (boolean)
          Specifies whether the user is required to set a new password on next
          sign-in.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a password for an IAM user

       To  create a password for an IAM user, we recommend using the --cli-in-
       put-json parameter to pass a JSON file that contains the password.  Us-
       ing this method, you can create a strong password with non-alphanumeric
       characters. It can be difficult to create a password with  non-alphanu-
       meric characters when you pass it as a command line parameter.

       To  use  the  --cli-input-json parameter, start by using the create-lo-
       gin-profile command with the --generate-cli-skeleton parameter,  as  in
       the following example.

          aws iam create-login-profile \
              --generate-cli-skeleton > create-login-profile.json

       The  previous  command  creates  a  JSON  file called create-login-pro-
       file.json that you can use to fill in the information for a  subsequent
       create-login-profile command. For example:

          {
              "UserName": "Bob",
              "Password": "&1-3a6u:RA0djs",
              "PasswordResetRequired": true
          }

       Next,  to  create a password for an IAM user, use the create-login-pro-
       file command again, this time passing the --cli-input-json parameter to
       specify your JSON file. The following create-login-profile command uses
       the --cli-input-json parameter  with  a  JSON  file  called  create-lo-
       gin-profile.json.

          aws iam create-login-profile \
              --cli-input-json file://create-login-profile.json

       Output:

          {
              "LoginProfile": {
                  "UserName": "Bob",
                  "CreateDate": "2015-03-10T20:55:40.274Z",
                  "PasswordResetRequired": true
              }
          }

       If  the  new password violates the account password policy, the command
       returns a PasswordPolicyViolation error.

       To change the password for a user that already has one, use  update-lo-
       gin-profile.  To  set  a  password  policy for the account, use the up-
       date-account-password-policy command.

       If the account password policy allows them to,  IAM  users  can  change
       their own passwords using the change-password command.

       For  more  information, see Managing passwords for IAM users in the AWS
       IAM User Guide.
