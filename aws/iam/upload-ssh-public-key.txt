UPLOAD-SSH-PUBLIC-KEY()                                UPLOAD-SSH-PUBLIC-KEY()



NAME
       upload-ssh-public-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Uploads  an  SSH  public  key  and associates it with the specified IAM
       user.

       The SSH public key uploaded by this operation can be used only for  au-
       thenticating  the  associated IAM user to an CodeCommit repository. For
       more information about using SSH keys to authenticate to an  CodeCommit
       repository, see Set up CodeCommit for SSH connections in the CodeCommit
       User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name of the IAM user to associate the SSH public key with.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --ssh-public-key-body (string)
          The SSH public key. The public key must be encoded in ssh-rsa format
          or PEM format. The minimum bit-length of  the  public  key  is  2048
          bits.  For example, you can generate a 2048-bit key, and the result-
          ing PEM file is 1679 bytes long.

          The regex pattern used to validate this parameter  is  a  string  of
          characters consisting of the following:

          o Any  printable  ASCII  character  ranging from the space character
            (\u0020 ) through the end of the ASCII character range

          o The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
            character set (through \u00FF )

          o The  special  characters  tab  (\u0009 ), line feed (\u000A ), and
            carriage return (\u000D )

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To upload an SSH public key and associate it with a user

       The following upload-ssh-public-key  command  uploads  the  public  key
       found in the file sshkey.pub and attaches it to the user sofia.

          aws iam upload-ssh-public-key \
              --user-name sofia \
              --ssh-public-key-body file://sshkey.pub

       Output:

          {
              "SSHPublicKey": {
                  "UserName": "sofia",
                  "SSHPublicKeyId": "APKA1234567890EXAMPLE",
                  "Fingerprint": "12:34:56:78:90:ab:cd:ef:12:34:56:78:90:ab:cd:ef",
                  "SSHPublicKeyBody": "ssh-rsa <<long string generated by ssh-keygen command>>",
                  "Status": "Active",
                  "UploadDate": "2019-04-18T17:04:49+00:00"
              }
          }

       For  more  information  about how to generate keys in a format suitable
       for this command, see SSH and Linux, macOS, or Unix: Set up the  public
       and  private keys for Git and CodeCommit or SSH and Windows: Set up the
       public and private keys for Git and CodeCommit in  the  AWS  CodeCommit
       User Guide.
