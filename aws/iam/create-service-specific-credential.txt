NAME
       create-service-specific-credential -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  a  set of credentials consisting of a user name and password
       that can be used to access the service specified in the request.  These
       credentials  are  generated by IAM, and can be used only for the speci-
       fied service.

       You can have a maximum of two sets of service-specific credentials  for
       each supported service per user.

       You  can  create service-specific credentials for CodeCommit and Amazon
       Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra).

       You can reset the password to a new service-generated value by  calling
       ResetServiceSpecificCredential .

       For  more information about service-specific credentials, see Using IAM
       with CodeCommit: Git credentials, SSH keys, and Amazon Web Services ac-
       cess keys in the IAM User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The  name  of the IAM user that is to be associated with the creden-
          tials. The new service-specific credentials have  the  same  permis-
          sions  as  the  associated user except that they can be used only to
          access the specified service.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --service-name (string)
          The name of the Amazon Web Services service that is to be associated
          with the credentials. The service you specify here is the only  ser-
          vice that can be accessed using these credentials.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Create a set of service-specific credentials for a user

       The  following  create-service-specific-credential  example  creates  a
       username and password that can be used to access  only  the  configured
       service.

          aws iam create-service-specific-credential --user-name sofia --service-name codecommit.amazonaws.com

       Output:

          {
              "ServiceSpecificCredential": {
                  "CreateDate": "2019-04-18T20:45:36+00:00",
                  "ServiceName": "codecommit.amazonaws.com",
                  "ServiceUserName": "sofia-at-123456789012",
                  "ServicePassword": "k1zPZM6uVxMQ3oxqgoYlNuJPyRTZ1vREs76zTQE3eJk=",
                  "ServiceSpecificCredentialId": "ACCAEXAMPLE123EXAMPLE",
                  "UserName": "sofia",
                  "Status": "Active"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       ServiceSpecificCredential -> (structure)
          A structure that contains information about the newly  created  ser-
          vice-specific credential.

          WARNING:
              This  is the only time that the password for this credential set
              is available. It cannot be recovered later.  Instead,  you  must
              reset the password with  ResetServiceSpecificCredential .

          CreateDate -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the ser-
              vice-specific credential were created.

          ServiceName -> (string)
              The name of the service  associated  with  the  service-specific
              credential.

          ServiceUserName -> (string)
              The  generated  user  name  for the service-specific credential.
              This value is generated by combining the IAM  user's  name  com-
              bined  with the ID number of the Amazon Web Services account, as
              in jane-at-123456789012 , for example. This value cannot be con-
              figured by the user.

          ServicePassword -> (string)
              The generated password for the service-specific credential.

          ServiceSpecificCredentialId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the service-specific credential.

          UserName -> (string)
              The  name  of  the IAM user associated with the service-specific
              credential.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the service-specific credential. Active means that
              the key is valid for API calls, while Inactive means it is not.
