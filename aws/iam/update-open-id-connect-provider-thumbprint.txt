UPDATE-OPEN-ID-CONNECT-PROVIDER-THUPDATE-OPEN-ID-CONNECT-PROVIDER-THUMBPRINT()



NAME
       update-open-id-connect-provider-thumbprint -

DESCRIPTION
       Replaces the existing list of server certificate thumbprints associated
       with an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource object with a new  list
       of thumbprints.

       The  list that you pass with this operation completely replaces the ex-
       isting list of thumbprints. (The lists are not merged.)

       Typically, you need to update  a  thumbprint  only  when  the  identity
       provider  certificate  changes,  which  occurs  rarely. However, if the
       provider's certificate does change, any attempt to assume an  IAM  role
       that  specifies  the  OIDC provider as a principal fails until the cer-
       tificate thumbprint is updated.

       NOTE:
          Amazon  Web  Services  secures  communication  with  OIDC   identity
          providers  (IdPs)  using our library of trusted root certificate au-
          thorities (CAs) to verify the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint's TLS
          certificate.  If  your  OIDC IdP relies on a certificate that is not
          signed by one of these trusted CAs, only then we  secure  communica-
          tion using the thumbprints set in the IdP's configuration.

       NOTE:
          Trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the provider certificate
          and is validated by the thumbprint. Therefore, it is best  to  limit
          access  to  the  UpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint  operation to
          highly privileged users.

OPTIONS
       --open-id-connect-provider-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM OIDC provider resource ob-
          ject for which you want to update the thumbprint. You can get a list
          of OIDC provider ARNs by using the  ListOpenIDConnectProviders oper-
          ation.

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
          the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --thumbprint-list (list)
          A list of certificate thumbprints that are associated with the spec-
          ified  IAM  OpenID Connect provider. For more information, see  Cre-
          ateOpenIDConnectProvider .

          (string)
              Contains a thumbprint for an identity provider's server certifi-
              cate.

              The  identity  provider's  server  certificate thumbprint is the
              hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the self-signed  X.509  certifi-
              cate.  This  thumbprint  is  used by the domain where the OpenID
              Connect provider makes its keys available. The thumbprint is al-
              ways a 40-character string.

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To replace the existing list of server certificate thumbprints  with  a
       new list

       This  example  updates  the  certificate  thumbprint  list for the OIDC
       provider  whose  ARN  is  arn:aws:iam::123456789012:oidc-provider/exam-
       ple.oidcprovider.com to use a new thumbprint.

          aws iam update-open-id-connect-provider-thumbprint \
              --open-id-connect-provider-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:oidc-provider/example.oidcprovider.com \
              --thumbprint-list 7359755EXAMPLEabc3060bce3EXAMPLEec4542a3

       This command produces no output.

       For  more  information,  see  Creating  OpenID  Connect (OIDC) identity
       providers in the AWS IAM User Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
