NAME
       list-service-specific-credentials -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about the service-specific credentials associated
       with the specified IAM user. If none exists, the operation  returns  an
       empty list. The service-specific credentials returned by this operation
       are used only for authenticating the IAM user to  a  specific  service.
       For  more  information  about using service-specific credentials to au-
       thenticate to an Amazon Web Services service, see Set  up  service-spe-
       cific credentials in the CodeCommit User Guide.

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name of the user whose service-specific credentials you want in-
          formation about. If this value is not specified, then the  operation
          assumes the user whose credentials are used to call the operation.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of upper  and  lowercase  alphanumeric  characters
          with  no  spaces.  You can also include any of the following charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --service-name (string)
          Filters the returned results to only those for the specified  Amazon
          Web Services service. If not specified, then Amazon Web Services re-
          turns service-specific credentials for all services.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve a list of credentials

       The following list-service-specific-credentials example lists the  cre-
       dentials  generated for HTTPS access to AWS CodeCommit repositories for
       a user named developer.

          aws iam list-service-specific-credentials \
              --user-name developer \
              --service-name codecommit.amazonaws.com

       Output:

          {
              "ServiceSpecificCredentials": [
                  {

                      "Status": "Inactive",

                  },

                      "UserName": "developer",
                      "Status": "Active",

                  }
