LIST-ROLES()                                                      LIST-ROLES()



NAME
       list-roles -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  IAM roles that have the specified path prefix. If there are
       none, the operation returns an empty list. For more  information  about
       roles, see Working with roles .

       NOTE:
          IAM resource-listing operations return a subset of the available at-
          tributes for the resource. For example, this operation does not  re-
          turn tags, even though they are an attribute of the returned object.
          To view all of the information for a role, see  GetRole .

       You can paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-roles is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: Roles

OPTIONS
       --path-prefix (string)
          The  path  prefix for filtering the results. For example, the prefix
          /application_abc/component_xyz/ gets all  roles  whose  path  starts
          with /application_abc/component_xyz/ .

          This  parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a
          slash (/), listing all roles. This  parameter  allows  (through  its
          regex  pattern  ) a string of characters consisting of either a for-
          ward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin  and  end  with
          forward  slashes.  In  addition,  it can contain any ASCII character
          from the ! (\u0021 ) through the DEL character (\u007F ),  including
          most  punctuation  characters, digits, and upper and lowercased let-
          ters.

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              teract with roles.

              Path -> (string)
                 The path to the role. For more information about  paths,  see
                 IAM identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

              RoleName -> (string)
                 The friendly name that identifies the role.

                 The  maximum  session duration (in seconds) for the specified
                 role. Anyone who uses the CLI, or API to assume the role  can
                 specify  the  duration using the optional DurationSeconds API
                 parameter or duration-seconds CLI parameter.

              PermissionsBoundary -> (structure)
                 The ARN of the policy used to set  the  permissions  boundary
                 for the role.

                 For   more  information  about  permissions  boundaries,  see
                 Permissions boundaries for IAM identities  in  the  IAM  User
                 Guide .

                 PermissionsBoundaryType -> (string)
                     The  permissions  boundary usage type that indicates what
                     type of IAM resource is used as the permissions  boundary
                     for  an  entity.  This data type can only have a value of

              Tags -> (list)
                 A list of tags that are attached to the role. For more infor-
                 mation about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources  in  the  IAM
                 User Guide .

                 (structure)
                     A  structure  that represents user-provided metadata that
                     can be associated with an IAM resource. For more informa-
                     tion  about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM
                     User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key name that can be used to look up  or  retrieve
                        the  associated value. For example, Department or Cost
                        Center are common choices.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value associated with this tag. For example,  tags
                        with  a  key name of Department could have values such
                        as Human Resources , Accounting , and Support  .  Tags
                        with  a key name of Cost Center might have values that
                        consist of the number associated  with  the  different
                        cost  centers  in  your  company.  Typically, many re-
                        sources have tags with the same key name but with dif-
                        ferent values.

                        NOTE:
                            Amazon  Web  Services  always  interprets  the tag
                            Value as a single string. If you need to store  an
                            array, you can store comma-separated values in the
                            string. However, you must interpret the  value  in
                            your code.

              RoleLastUsed -> (structure)
                 Contains information about the last time that an IAM role was
                 used. This includes the date and time and the Region in which
                 the  role  was  last  used. Activity is only reported for the
                 trailing 400 days. This period can be shorter if your  Region
                 began  supporting  these  features  within the last year. The
                 role might have been used more than 400 days  ago.  For  more
                 information,  see  Regions  where  data is tracked in the IAM
                 user Guide .

                 LastUsedDate -> (timestamp)
                     The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format that  the
                     role was last used.

                     This  field  is null if the role has not been used within
                     the IAM tracking period. For more information  about  the
                     tracking period, see Regions where data is tracked in the
                     IAM User Guide .

                 Region -> (string)
                     The name of the Amazon Web Services Region in  which  the
                     role was last used.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A  flag  that  indicates  whether there are more items to return. If
          your results were truncated, you can make  a  subsequent  pagination
          request  using  the Marker request parameter to retrieve more items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even  when  there  are more results available. We recommend that you
          check IsTruncated after every call to ensure that  you  receive  all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When  IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains the
          value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination re-
          quest.
