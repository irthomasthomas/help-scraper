OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To see the current account password policy

       The  following  get-account-password-policy  command  displays  details
       about the password policy for the current account:

          aws iam get-account-password-policy

       Output:

          {
              "PasswordPolicy": {
                  "AllowUsersToChangePassword": false,
                  "RequireLowercaseCharacters": false,
                  "RequireUppercaseCharacters": false,
                  "MinimumPasswordLength": 8,
                  "RequireNumbers": true,
                  "RequireSymbols": true
              }
          }

       If no password policy is defined for the account, the command returns a
       NoSuchEntity error.

       For more information, see Managing an IAM Password Policy in the  Using
       IAM guide.

OUTPUT
       PasswordPolicy -> (structure)
          A  structure that contains details about the account's password pol-
          icy.

          MinimumPasswordLength -> (integer)
              Minimum length to require for IAM user passwords.

          RequireSymbols -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether IAM user passwords must contain at  least  one
              of the following symbols:

              ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ + - = [ ] { } | '

          RequireNumbers -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  IAM user passwords must contain at least one
              numeric character (0 to 9).

          RequireUppercaseCharacters -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether IAM user passwords must contain at  least  one
              uppercase character (A to Z).

          RequireLowercaseCharacters -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  IAM user passwords must contain at least one
              lowercase character (a to z).

          AllowUsersToChangePassword -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether IAM users are  allowed  to  change  their  own
              password.  Gives IAM users permissions to iam:ChangePassword for
              only their user and to the iam:GetAccountPasswordPolicy  action.
              This  option  does not attach a permissions policy to each user,
              rather the permissions are applied at the account-level for  all
              users by IAM.

          ExpirePasswords -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether passwords in the account expire. Returns true
              if MaxPasswordAge contains a value greater than 0. Returns false
              if MaxPasswordAge is 0 or not present.

          MaxPasswordAge -> (integer)
              The number of days that an IAM user password is valid.

          PasswordReusePrevention -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  number  of previous passwords that IAM users are
              prevented from reusing.

          HardExpiry -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether IAM users are prevented  from  setting  a  new
              password  via  the  Amazon Web Services Management Console after
              their password has expired. The IAM user cannot access the  con-
              sole  until an administrator resets the password. IAM users with
              iam:ChangePassword permission and active access keys  can  reset
              their own expired console password using the CLI or API.
