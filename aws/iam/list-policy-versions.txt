LIST-POLICY-VERSIONS()                                  LIST-POLICY-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-policy-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  information  about the versions of the specified managed policy,
       including the version that is currently set  as  the  policy's  default
       version.

       For  more  information about managed policies, see Managed policies and
       inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-policy-versions is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Versions

OPTIONS
       --policy-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM policy for which you want
          the versions.

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
          the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list information about the versions of the specified managed policy

       This example returns the list of available versions of the policy whose
       ARN is arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MySamplePolicy.

          aws iam list-policy-versions \
              --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MySamplePolicy

       Output:

          {
              "IsTruncated": false,
              "Versions": [
                  {
                  "VersionId": "v2",
                  "IsDefaultVersion": true,
                  "CreateDate": "2015-06-02T23:19:44Z"
                  },
                  {
                  "VersionId": "v1",
                  "IsDefaultVersion": false,
                  "CreateDate": "2015-06-02T22:30:47Z"
                  }
              ]
          }

       IAM User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Versions -> (list)
          A list of policy versions.

          For more information about managed policy versions,  see  Versioning
          for managed policies in the IAM User Guide .

          (structure)
              Contains information about a version of a managed policy.

              This data type is used as a response element in the  CreatePoli-
              cyVersion  ,   GetPolicyVersion  ,   ListPolicyVersions  ,   and
              GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations.

              For  more  information  about managed policies, refer to Managed
              policies and inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

              Document -> (string)
                 The policy document.

                 The policy document is returned in the response to the   Get-
                 PolicyVersion and  GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations.
                 It is not returned in the response to  the   CreatePolicyVer-
                 sion or  ListPolicyVersions operations.

                 The policy document returned in this structure is URL-encoded
                 compliant with RFC 3986 . You can use a URL  decoding  method
                 to  convert  the policy back to plain JSON text. For example,
                 if you use Java,  you  can  use  the  decode  method  of  the
                 java.net.URLDecoder utility class in the Java SDK. Other lan-
                 guages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

              VersionId -> (string)
                 The identifier for the policy version.

                 Policy version identifiers always begin with v (always lower-
                 case).  When a policy is created, the first policy version is
                 v1 .

              IsDefaultVersion -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the policy version is set as  the  policy's
                 default version.

              CreateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the
                 policy version was created.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more  items  to  return.  If
          your  results  were  truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination
          request using the Marker request parameter to retrieve  more  items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even when there are more results available. We  recommend  that  you
          check  IsTruncated  after  every call to ensure that you receive all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains  the
          value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination re-
          quest.
