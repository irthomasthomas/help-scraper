UPDATE-SERVER-CERTIFICATE()                        UPDATE-SERVER-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       update-server-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  name  and/or the path of the specified server certificate
       stored in IAM.

       For more  information  about  working  with  server  certificates,  see
       Working  with  server  certificates  in the IAM User Guide . This topic
       also includes a list of Amazon Web Services services that can  use  the
       server certificates that you manage with IAM.

       WARNING:
          You should understand the implications of changing a server certifi-
          cate's path or name. For more information,  see  Renaming  a  server
          certificate in the IAM User Guide .

       NOTE:
          The  person making the request (the principal), must have permission
          to change the server certificate with the old name and the new name.
          For example, to change the certificate named ProductionCert to Prod-
          Cert , the principal must have a policy that allows them  to  update
          both  certificates.  If  the  principal has permission to update the
          ProductionCert group, but not the ProdCert certificate, then the up-
          date  fails. For more information about permissions, see Access man-
          agement in the IAM User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --server-certificate-name (string)
          The name of the server certificate that you want to update.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --new-path (string)
          The  new  path  for the server certificate. Include this only if you
          are updating the server certificate's path.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  either  a  forward  slash (/) by itself or a
          string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it
          can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021 ) through the DEL
          character (\u007F ), including most punctuation characters,  digits,
          and upper and lowercased letters.

       --new-server-certificate-name (string)
          The  new  name  for the server certificate. Include this only if you
          are updating the server certificate's name. The name of the certifi-
          cate cannot contain any spaces.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of upper  and  lowercase  alphanumeric  characters
          with  no  spaces.  You can also include any of the following charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To change the path or name of a server certificate in your AWS account

       The following update-server-certificate command changes the name of the
       certificate from myServerCertificate to myUpdatedServerCertificate.  It
       also changes the path to /cloudfront/ so that it can be accessed by the
       Amazon CloudFront service. This command produces no output. You can see
       the  results of the update by running the list-server-certificates com-
       mand.

          aws-iam update-server-certificate \
              --server-certificate-name myServerCertificate \
              --new-server-certificate-name myUpdatedServerCertificate \
              --new-path /cloudfront/

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Managing server certificates in  IAM  in  the
       AWS IAM User Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
