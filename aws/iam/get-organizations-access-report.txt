NAME
       get-organizations-access-report -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the service last accessed data report for Organizations that
       was previously generated using the  ``   GenerateOrganizationsAccessRe-
       port  ``  operation. This operation retrieves the status of your report
       job and the report contents.

       Depending on the parameters that you passed when you generated the  re-
       port,  the  data  returned could include different information. For de-
       tails, see  GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport .

       To call this operation, you must be signed in to the management account
       in  your organization. SCPs must be enabled for your organization root.
       You must have permissions to perform this operation. For more  informa-
       tion,  see Refining permissions using service last accessed data in the
       IAM User Guide .

       For each service that principals in an account (root user,  IAM  users,
       or  IAM  roles)  could access using SCPs, the operation returns details
       about the most recent access attempt. If there was no attempt, the ser-
       vice  is listed without details about the most recent attempt to access
       the service. If the operation fails, it  returns  the  reason  that  it
       failed.

       By default, the list is sorted by service namespace.

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the request generated by the  GenerateOrganiza-
          tionsAccessReport operation.

       --max-items (integer)
          Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number
          of  items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond
          the maximum you specify, the IsTruncated response element is true .

          If you do not include this parameter, the number of  items  defaults
          to  100.  Note  that IAM might return fewer results, even when there
          are more results available. In that case, the  IsTruncated  response
          element returns true , and Marker contains a value to include in the
          subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

       --marker (string)
          Use this parameter only when paginating results and only  after  you
          receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it
          to the value of the Marker element in the response that you received
          to indicate where the next call should start.

       --sort-key (string)
          The  key  that  is used to sort the results. If you choose the name-
          space key, the results are returned in alphabetical  order.  If  you
          choose  the time key, the results are sorted numerically by the date
          and time.

          Possible values:

          o SERVICE_NAMESPACE_ASCENDING

          o SERVICE_NAMESPACE_DESCENDING

          o LAST_AUTHENTICATED_TIME_ASCENDING

          o LAST_AUTHENTICATED_TIME_DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve an access report

       The following get-organizations-access-report example displays a previ-
       ously generated access report for an AWS Organizations entity. To  gen-
       erate a report, use the generate-organizations-access-report command.

          aws iam get-organizations-access-report \
              --job-id a8b6c06f-aaa4-8xmp-28bc-81da71836359

       Output:

          cess the service.

          (structure)
              An object that contains details about when a  principal  in  the
              reported Organizations entity last attempted to access an Amazon
              Web Services service. A principal can be an  IAM  user,  an  IAM
              role,  or  the  Amazon Web Services account root user within the
              reported Organizations entity.

              This data type is a response element in the  GetOrganizationsAc-
              cessReport operation.

                 The name of the service in which access was attempted.

              ServiceNamespace -> (string)
                 The namespace of the service in which access was attempted.

                 To learn the service namespace of a service, see Actions, re-
                 sources, and condition keys for Amazon Web Services  services
                 in  the  Service Authorization Reference . Choose the name of
                 the service to view details for that service.  In  the  first
                 paragraph,  find  the  service  prefix. For example, (service
                 prefix: a4b) . For more information about service namespaces,
                 see  Amazon Web Services service namespaces in the Amazon Web
                 Services General Reference .

              Region -> (string)
                 The Region where the last service access attempt occurred.

                 This field is null if no principals in the reported Organiza-
                 tions  entity  attempted  to  access  the  service within the
                 tracking period .

              EntityPath -> (string)
                 The path of the Organizations  entity  (root,  organizational
                 unit,  or account) from which an authenticated principal last
                 attempted to access the service. Amazon Web Services does not
                 report unauthenticated requests.

                 This field is null if no principals (IAM users, IAM roles, or
                 root user) in the reported Organizations entity attempted  to
                 access the service within the tracking period .

              LastAuthenticatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when an au-
                 thenticated principal most recently attempted to  access  the
                 service.  Amazon Web Services does not report unauthenticated
                 requests.

                 This field is null if no principals in the reported Organiza-
                 tions  entity  attempted  to  access  the  service within the
                 tracking period .

              TotalAuthenticatedEntities -> (integer)
                 The number of accounts with  authenticated  principals  (root
                 user,  IAM users, and IAM roles) that attempted to access the
                 service in the tracking period.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more  items  to  return.  If
          your  results  were  truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination
          request using the Marker request parameter to retrieve  more  items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even when there are more results available. We  recommend  that  you
          check  IsTruncated  after  every call to ensure that you receive all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains  the
          value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination re-
          quest.

       ErrorDetails -> (structure)
          Contains information about the reason that the operation failed.

          This data type is used as a response element  in  the   GetOrganiza-
          tionsAccessReport  ,   GetServiceLastAccessedDetails  , and  GetSer-
          viceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities operations.

          Message -> (string)
              Detailed information about the reason that the operation failed.

          Code -> (string)
              The error code associated with the operation failure.
