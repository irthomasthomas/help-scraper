NAME
       cloudtrail-data -

DESCRIPTION
       The CloudTrail Data Service lets you ingest events into CloudTrail from
       any source in your hybrid environments, such as in-house or SaaS appli-
       cations  hosted  on-premises or in the cloud, virtual machines, or con-
       tainers. You can store, access, analyze, troubleshoot and  take  action
       on this data without maintaining multiple log aggregators and reporting
       tools. After you run PutAuditEvents to ingest your application activity
       into CloudTrail, you can use CloudTrail Lake to search, query, and ana-
       lyze the data that is logged from your applications.
