NAME
       describe-accelerator-types -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the accelerator types available in a given region, as well as
       their characteristics, such as memory and throughput.

       February 15, 2023: Starting April 15, 2023, AWS will  not  onboard  new
       customers  to Amazon Elastic Inference (EI), and will help current cus-
       tomers migrate their workloads to options that offer better  price  and
       performance.  After  April  15, 2023, new customers will not be able to
       launch instances with Amazon EI accelerators in Amazon SageMaker,  Ama-
       zon  ECS,  or Amazon EC2. However, customers who have used Amazon EI at
       least once during the past 30-day period are  considered  current  cus-
       tomers and will be able to continue using the service.

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       acceleratorTypes -> (list)
          The available accelerator types.

          (structure)
              The details of an Elastic Inference Accelerator type.

              acceleratorTypeName -> (string)
                 The name of the Elastic Inference Accelerator type.

              memoryInfo -> (structure)
                 The memory information of the Elastic  Inference  Accelerator
                 type.

                 sizeInMiB -> (integer)
                     The  size in mebibytes of the Elastic Inference Accelera-
                     tor type.

              throughputInfo -> (list)
                 The throughput information of the Elastic Inference Accelera-
                 tor type.

                 (structure)
                     A  throughput  entry for an Elastic Inference Accelerator
                     type.

                     key -> (string)
                        The throughput value of the Elastic Inference Acceler-
                        ator   type.  It  can  assume  the  following  values:
                        TFLOPS16bit: the throughput expressed  in  16bit  Ter-
                        aFLOPS. TFLOPS32bit: the throughput expressed in 32bit
                        TeraFLOPS.

                     value -> (integer)
                        The throughput value of the Elastic Inference Acceler-
                        ator type.
