OPTIONS
       --predictor-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the predictor that you want infor-
          mation about.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       FeaturizationConfig -> (structure)
          The featurization configuration.

          ForecastFrequency -> (string)
              The frequency of predictions in a forecast.

              Valid  intervals are an integer followed by Y (Year), M (Month),
              W (Week), D (Day), H (Hour), and min (Minute). For example, "1D"
              indicates  every day and "15min" indicates every 15 minutes. You
              cannot specify a value that would overlap with the  next  larger
              frequency.  That  means,  for example, you cannot specify a fre-
              quency of 60 minutes, because that is equivalent to 1 hour.  The
              valid values for each frequency are the following:

              o Minute - 1-59

              o Hour - 1-23

              o Day - 1-6

              o Week - 1-4

              o Month - 1-11

              o Year - 1

              Thus,  if you want every other week forecasts, specify "2W". Or,
              if you want quarterly forecasts, you specify "3M".

              The frequency  must  be  greater  than  or  equal  to  the  TAR-
              GET_TIME_SERIES dataset frequency.

              When  a  RELATED_TIME_SERIES  dataset is provided, the frequency
              must be equal to the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset frequency.

          ForecastDimensions -> (list)
              An array of dimension (field) names that specify  how  to  group
              the generated forecast.

              For example, suppose that you are generating a forecast for item
              sales across all of your stores, and  your  dataset  contains  a
              store_id  field. If you want the sales forecast for each item by
              store, you would specify store_id as the dimension.

              All forecast  dimensions  specified  in  the  TARGET_TIME_SERIES
              dataset  don't  need  to be specified in the CreatePredictor re-
              quest. All forecast dimensions specified in the RELATED_TIME_SE-
              RIES dataset must be specified in the CreatePredictor request.

              (string)

          Featurizations -> (list)
              An  array  of featurization (transformation) information for the
              fields of a dataset.

              (structure)

                 NOTE:
                     This object belongs to the  CreatePredictor operation. If
                     you  created  your  predictor with  CreateAutoPredictor ,
                     see  AttributeConfig .

                 Provides featurization  (transformation)  information  for  a
                 dataset  field. This object is part of the  FeaturizationCon-
                 fig object.

                 For example:
                     {

                     "AttributeName": "demand",

                     FeaturizationPipeline [ {

                     "FeaturizationMethodName": "filling",

                     "FeaturizationMethodParameters":  {"aggregation":  "avg",
                     "backfill": "nan"}

                     } ]

                     }

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     The  name of the schema attribute that specifies the data
                     field to be featurized. Amazon Forecast supports the tar-
                     get   field   of   the  TARGET_TIME_SERIES  and  the  RE-
                     LATED_TIME_SERIES datasets. For example, for  the  RETAIL
                     domain, the target is demand , and for the CUSTOM domain,
                     the target is target_value . For  more  information,  see
                     howitworks-missing-values .

                 FeaturizationPipeline -> (list)
                     An array of one FeaturizationMethod object that specifies
                     the feature transformation method.

                     (structure)
                        Provides information about the method that  featurizes
                        (transforms)  a  dataset  field. The method is part of
                        the FeaturizationPipeline of  the   Featurization  ob-
                        ject.

                        The  following is an example of how you specify a Fea-
                        turizationMethod object.
                            {

                            "FeaturizationMethodName": "filling",

                            "FeaturizationMethodParameters":   {"aggregation":
                            "sum", "middlefill": "zero", "backfill": "zero"}

                            }

                        FeaturizationMethodName -> (string)
                            The  name  of  the method. The "filling" method is
                            the only supported method.

                        FeaturizationMethodParameters -> (map)
                            The method parameters (key-value pairs), which are
                            a map of override parameters. Specify these param-
                            eters to override the default values. Related Time
                            Series attributes do not accept aggregation param-
                            eters.

                            The following list shows the parameters and  their
                            valid   values  for  the  "filling"  featurization
                            method for a Target Time Series dataset. Bold sig-
                            nifies the default value.

                            o aggregation : sum , avg , first , min , max

                            o frontfill : none

                            o middlefill  : zero , nan (not a number), value ,
                              median , mean , min , max

                            o backfill : zero , nan , value , median , mean  ,

                            valid values for a Related Time Series  featuriza-
                            tion method (there are no defaults):

                            o middlefill  : zero , value , median , mean , min
                              , max

                              max

                            o futurefill  : zero , value , median , mean , min
                              , max

                            To set a filling method to a specific  value,  set
                            the  fill  parameter to value and define the value
                            in a corresponding _value parameter. For  example,
                            to  set  backfilling  to a value of 2, include the
                            following:   "backfill":   "value"   and    "back-
                            fill_value":"2" .
