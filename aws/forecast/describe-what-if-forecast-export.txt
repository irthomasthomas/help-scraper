OPTIONS
       --what-if-forecast-export-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the what-if forecast export that
          you are interested in.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       WhatIfForecastExportArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the what-if forecast export.

       WhatIfForecastExportName -> (string)
          The name of the what-if forecast export.

       WhatIfForecastArns -> (list)
          An  array  of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) that represent all of the
          what-if forecasts exported in this resource.

          (string)

       Destination -> (structure)
          The destination for an export job. Provide an S3 path,  an  Identity
          and  Access Management (IAM) role that allows Amazon Forecast to ac-
          cess the location, and an Key  Management  Service  (KMS)  key  (op-
          tional).

          S3Config -> (structure)
              The  path to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket
              along with the credentials to access the bucket.

              Path -> (string)
                 The path to an Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service  (Amazon  S3)
                 bucket or file(s) in an Amazon S3 bucket.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that
                 Amazon Forecast can assume to access the Amazon S3 bucket  or
                 files. If you provide a value for the KMSKeyArn key, the role
                 must allow access to the key.

                 Passing a role across Amazon Web Services accounts is not al-
                 lowed. If you pass a role that isn't in your account, you get
                 an InvalidInputException error.

              KMSKeyArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Key  Management  Service
                 (KMS) key.

       Message -> (string)
          If an error occurred, an informational message about the error.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the what-if forecast. States include:

          o ACTIVE

          o CREATE_PENDING , CREATE_IN_PROGRESS , CREATE_FAILED

          o CREATE_STOPPING , CREATE_STOPPED

          o DELETE_PENDING , DELETE_IN_PROGRESS , DELETE_FAILED

          NOTE:
              The  Status of the what-if forecast export must be ACTIVE before
              you can access the forecast export.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          When the what-if forecast export was created.

       EstimatedTimeRemainingInMinutes -> (long)
          The approximate time remaining to complete the what-if forecast  ex-
          port, in minutes.

       LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
          The  last  time  the resource was modified. The timestamp depends on
          the status of the job:

          o CREATE_PENDING - The CreationTime .

          o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS - The current timestamp.

          o CREATE_STOPPING - The current timestamp.

          o CREATE_STOPPED - When the job stopped.

          o ACTIVE or CREATE_FAILED - When the job finished or failed.

       Format -> (string)
          The format of the exported data, CSV or PARQUET.
