CREATE-FORECAST()                                            CREATE-FORECAST()



NAME
       create-forecast -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a forecast for each item in the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset that
       was used to train the predictor. This is known  as  inference.  To  re-
       trieve  the  forecast  for a single item at low latency, use the opera-
       tion. To export the complete forecast into your Amazon  Simple  Storage
       Service (Amazon S3) bucket, use the  CreateForecastExportJob operation.

       The  range  of the forecast is determined by the ForecastHorizon value,
       which you specify in the  CreatePredictor request.  When  you  query  a
       forecast, you can request a specific date range within the forecast.

       To get a list of all your forecasts, use the  ListForecasts operation.

       NOTE:
          The forecasts generated by Amazon Forecast are in the same time zone
          as the dataset that was used to create the predictor.

       For more information, see  howitworks-forecast .

       NOTE:
          The Status of the forecast must be ACTIVE before you  can  query  or
          export  the forecast. Use the  DescribeForecast operation to get the
          status.

       By default, a forecast includes predictions for every item  (item_id  )
       in the dataset group that was used to train the predictor. However, you
       can use the TimeSeriesSelector object to generate a forecast on a  sub-
       set  of  time  series. Forecast creation is skipped for any time series
       that you specify that are not in the input dataset. The forecast export
       file will not contain these time series or their forecasted values.

OPTIONS
       --forecast-name (string)
          A name for the forecast.

       --predictor-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the predictor to use to generate
          the forecast.

       --forecast-types (list)
          The quantiles at which probabilistic forecasts  are  generated.  You
          can currently specify up to 5 quantiles per forecast . Accepted val-
          ues include 0.01 to 0.99 (increments of .01 only)  and  mean  .  The
          mean forecast is different from the median (0.50) when the distribu-
          tion is not symmetric (for example, Beta and Negative Binomial).

          The default quantiles are the quantiles you specified during predic-
          tor  creation.  If  you didn't specify quantiles, the default values
          are ["0.1", "0.5", "0.9"] .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The optional metadata that you apply to the  forecast  to  help  you
          categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an op-
          tional value, both of which you define.

          The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

          o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

          o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each  tag  key
            can have only one value.

          o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and re-
            sources, remember that other services may have restrictions on al-
            lowed  characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, num-
            bers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following charac-
            ters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

          o Do  not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination of
            such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for  Amazon  Web  Ser-
            vices  use.  You  cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix.
            Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its  prefix
            but  the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag
            and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags  with  only  the
            key  prefix  of  aws  do  not count against your tags per resource
            limit.

          (structure)
              The optional metadata that you apply to a resource to  help  you
              categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an
              optional value, both of which you define.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

              o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and  each  tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

              o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and
                resources, remember that other services may have  restrictions
                on  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon  Web
                Services  use.  You  cannot  edit or delete tag keys with this
                prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as
                its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to
                be a user tag and will count against the  limit  of  50  tags.
                Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your
                tags per resource limit.

              Key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A key is  a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag.  A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --time-series-selector (structure)
          Defines the set of time series that are used to create the forecasts
          in a TimeSeriesIdentifiers object.

          The TimeSeriesIdentifiers object needs the following information:

          o DataSource

          o Format

          o Schema

          TimeSeriesIdentifiers -> (structure)
              Details about the import file that contains the time series  for
              which you want to create forecasts.

              DataSource -> (structure)
                 The  source  of  your data, an Identity and Access Management
                 (IAM) role that allows Amazon Forecast  to  access  the  data
                 and, optionally, an Key Management Service (KMS) key.

                 S3Config -> (structure)
                     The  path  to the data stored in an Amazon Simple Storage
                     Service (Amazon S3) bucket along with the credentials  to
                     access the data.

                     Path -> (string)
                        The  path  to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon
                        S3) bucket or file(s) in an Amazon S3 bucket.

                     RoleArn -> (string)
                        The ARN of the Identity and  Access  Management  (IAM)
                        role  that  Amazon  Forecast  can assume to access the
                        Amazon S3 bucket or files. If you provide a value  for
                        the  KMSKeyArn  key, the role must allow access to the
                        key.

                        Passing a role across Amazon Web Services accounts  is
                        not allowed. If you pass a role that isn't in your ac-
                        count, you get an InvalidInputException error.

                     KMSKeyArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  an  Key  Management
                        Service (KMS) key.

              Schema -> (structure)
                 Defines the fields of a dataset.

                 Attributes -> (list)
                     An  array  of  attributes specifying the name and type of
                     each field in a dataset.

                     (structure)
                        An attribute of a  schema,  which  defines  a  dataset
                        field.  A schema attribute is required for every field
                        in a dataset. The Schema object contains an  array  of
                        SchemaAttribute objects.

                        AttributeName -> (string)
                            The name of the dataset field.

                        AttributeType -> (string)
                            The data type of the field.

                            For  a  related  time  series  dataset, other than
                            date, item_id, and forecast dimensions attributes,
                            all  attributes should be of numerical type (inte-
                            ger/float).

              Format -> (string)
                 The format of the data, either CSV or PARQUET.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TimeSeriesIdentifiers": {
              "DataSource": {
                "S3Config": {
                  "Path": "string",
                  "RoleArn": "string",
                  "KMSKeyArn": "string"
                }
              },
              "Schema": {

                  {
                    "AttributeName": "string",
                    "AttributeType": "string"|"integer"|"float"|"timestamp"|"geolocation"
                  }
                  ...
                ]
              },
              "Format": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
