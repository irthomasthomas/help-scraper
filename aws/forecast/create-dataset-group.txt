CREATE-DATASET-GROUP()                                  CREATE-DATASET-GROUP()



NAME
       create-dataset-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a dataset group, which holds a collection of related datasets.
       You can add datasets to the dataset group when you create  the  dataset
       group, or later by using the UpdateDatasetGroup operation.

       After creating a dataset group and adding datasets, you use the dataset
       group when you create a predictor. For more  information,  see  Dataset
       groups .

       To  get  a  list of all your datasets groups, use the ListDatasetGroups
       operation.

       NOTE:
          The Status of a dataset group must be ACTIVE before you can use  the
          dataset  group  to  create  a  predictor. To get the status, use the
          DescribeDatasetGroup operation.

OPTIONS
       --dataset-group-name (string)
          A name for the dataset group.

       --domain (string)
          The domain associated with the dataset group. When you add a dataset
          to  a  dataset group, this value and the value specified for the Do-
          main parameter of the CreateDataset operation must match.

          The Domain and DatasetType that you choose determine the fields that
          must  be  present in training data that you import to a dataset. For
          example, if you choose the RETAIL domain and  TARGET_TIME_SERIES  as
          the  DatasetType , Amazon Forecast requires that item_id , timestamp
          , and demand fields are present in your data. For more  information,
          see Dataset groups .

          Possible values:

          o RETAIL

          o CUSTOM

          o INVENTORY_PLANNING

          o EC2_CAPACITY

          o WORK_FORCE

          o WEB_TRAFFIC

          o METRICS

       --dataset-arns (list)
          An  array  of  Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the datasets that you
          want to include in the dataset group.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The optional metadata that you apply to the dataset  group  to  help
          you  categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an
          optional value, both of which you define.

          The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

          o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

          o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each  tag  key
            can have only one value.

          o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and re-
            sources, remember that other services may have restrictions on al-
            lowed  characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, num-
            bers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following charac-
            ters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

          o Do  not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination of
            such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for  Amazon  Web  Ser-
            vices  use.  You  cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix.
            Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its  prefix
            but  the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag
            and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags  with  only  the
            key  prefix  of  aws  do  not count against your tags per resource
            limit.

          (structure)
              The optional metadata that you apply to a resource to  help  you
              categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an
              optional value, both of which you define.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

              o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and  each  tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

              o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and
                resources, remember that other services may have  restrictions
                on  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon  Web
                Services  use.  You  cannot  edit or delete tag keys with this
                prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as
                its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to
                be a user tag and will count against the  limit  of  50  tags.
                Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your
                tags per resource limit.

              Key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A key is  a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag.  A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       DatasetGroupArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset group.
