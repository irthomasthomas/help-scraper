CREATE-DATASET()                                              CREATE-DATASET()



NAME
       create-dataset -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  Amazon Forecast dataset. The information about the dataset
       that you provide helps Forecast understand how to consume the data  for
       model training. This includes the following:

       o

         *
         DataFrequency  * - How frequently your historical time-series data is
         collected.

       System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 23)
         Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

       o

         *
         Domain * and * DatasetType * - Each dataset has an associated dataset
         domain  and a type within the domain. Amazon Forecast provides a list
         of predefined domains and types within each domain. For  each  unique
         dataset  domain  and type within the domain, Amazon Forecast requires
         your data to include a minimum set of predefined fields.

       System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 25)
         Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

       o

         *
         Schema * - A schema specifies the fields in  the  dataset,  including
         the field name and data type.

       System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 27)
         Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

       After creating a dataset, you import your training data into it and add
       the dataset to a dataset group. You use the dataset group to  create  a
       predictor. For more information, see Importing datasets .

       To get a list of all your datasets, use the ListDatasets operation.

       For  example  Forecast  datasets, see the Amazon Forecast Sample GitHub
       repository .

       NOTE:
          The Status of a dataset must be ACTIVE before you can import  train-
          ing data. Use the DescribeDataset operation to get the status.

OPTIONS
       --dataset-name (string)
          A name for the dataset.

       --domain (string)
          The  domain associated with the dataset. When you add a dataset to a
          dataset group, this value and the value specified for the Domain pa-
          rameter of the CreateDatasetGroup operation must match.

          The Domain and DatasetType that you choose determine the fields that
          must be present in the training data that you import to the dataset.
          For  example, if you choose the RETAIL domain and TARGET_TIME_SERIES
          as the DatasetType , Amazon Forecast requires item_id , timestamp  ,
          and  demand fields to be present in your data. For more information,
          see Importing datasets .

          Possible values:

          o RETAIL

          o CUSTOM

          o INVENTORY_PLANNING

          o EC2_CAPACITY

          o WORK_FORCE

          o WEB_TRAFFIC

          o METRICS

       --dataset-type (string)
          The dataset type. Valid values depend on the chosen Domain .

          Possible values:

          o TARGET_TIME_SERIES

          o RELATED_TIME_SERIES

          o ITEM_METADATA

       --data-frequency (string)
          The frequency of data collection. This parameter is required for RE-
          LATED_TIME_SERIES datasets.

          Valid  intervals  are  an integer followed by Y (Year), M (Month), W
          (Week), D (Day), H (Hour), and min (Minute). For example, "1D" indi-
          cates  every  day and "15min" indicates every 15 minutes. You cannot
          specify a value that would overlap with the next  larger  frequency.
          That  means,  for example, you cannot specify a frequency of 60 min-
          utes, because that is equivalent to 1 hour.  The  valid  values  for
          each frequency are the following:

          o Minute - 1-59

          o Hour - 1-23

          o Day - 1-6

          o Week - 1-4

          o Month - 1-11

          o Year - 1

          Thus,  if  you want every other week forecasts, specify "2W". Or, if
          you want quarterly forecasts, you specify "3M".

       --schema (structure)
          The schema for the dataset. The schema attributes  and  their  order
          must  match the fields in your data. The dataset Domain and Dataset-
          Type that you choose determine the minimum required fields  in  your
          training  data. For information about the required fields for a spe-
          cific dataset domain and type, see Dataset Domains and Dataset Types
          .

          Attributes -> (list)
              An  array  of  attributes  specifying  the name and type of each
              field in a dataset.

              (structure)
                 An attribute of a schema, which defines a  dataset  field.  A
                 schema  attribute  is  required for every field in a dataset.
                 The Schema object contains an array  of  SchemaAttribute  ob-
                 jects.

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     The name of the dataset field.

                 AttributeType -> (string)
                     The data type of the field.

                     For  a  related  time  series  dataset,  other than date,
                     item_id, and  forecast  dimensions  attributes,  all  at-
                     tributes should be of numerical type (integer/float).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Attributes=[{AttributeName=string,AttributeType=string},{AttributeName=string,AttributeType=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Attributes": [
              {
                "AttributeName": "string",
                "AttributeType": "string"|"integer"|"float"|"timestamp"|"geolocation"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --encryption-config (structure)
          An Key Management Service (KMS) key and the Identity and Access Man-
          agement (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can  assume  to  access  the
          key.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  of the IAM role that Amazon Forecast can assume to ac-
              cess the KMS key.

              Passing a role across Amazon Web Services accounts  is  not  al-
              lowed. If you pass a role that isn't in your account, you get an
              InvalidInputException error.

          KMSKeyArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RoleArn=string,KMSKeyArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RoleArn": "string",
            "KMSKeyArn": "string"
          }

       --tags (list)
          The optional metadata that you apply to the dataset to help you cat-
          egorize  and  organize  them.  Each tag consists of a key and an op-
          tional value, both of which you define.

          The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

          o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

          o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each  tag  key
            can have only one value.

          o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and re-
            sources, remember that other services may have restrictions on al-
            lowed  characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, num-
            bers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following charac-
            ters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

          o Do  not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination of
            such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for  Amazon  Web  Ser-
            vices  use.  You  cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix.
            Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its  prefix
            but  the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag
            and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags  with  only  the
            key  prefix  of  aws  do  not count against your tags per resource
            limit.

          (structure)
              The optional metadata that you apply to a resource to  help  you
              categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an
              optional value, both of which you define.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

              o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and  each  tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

              o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and
                resources, remember that other services may have  restrictions
                on  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon  Web
                Services  use.  You  cannot  edit or delete tag keys with this
                prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as
                its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to
                be a user tag and will count against the  limit  of  50  tags.
                Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your
                tags per resource limit.

              Key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A key is  a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag.  A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       DatasetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset.
