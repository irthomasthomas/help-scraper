OPTIONS
       --monitor-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the monitor resource to describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       MonitorName -> (string)
          The name of the monitor.

       MonitorArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the monitor resource described.

       ResourceArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the auto predictor being moni-
          tored.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the monitor resource.

       LastEvaluationTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of the latest evaluation completed by the monitor.

       LastEvaluationState -> (string)
          The state of the monitor's latest evaluation.

       Baseline -> (structure)
          Metrics you can use as a baseline for comparison purposes. Use these
          values you interpret monitoring results for an auto predictor.

          PredictorBaseline -> (structure)
              The  initial accuracy metrics for the predictor you are monitor-
              ing. Use these metrics as a baseline for comparison purposes  as
              you use your predictor and the metrics change.

              BaselineMetrics -> (list)
                 The  initial  accuracy  metrics  for the predictor. Use these
                 metrics as a baseline for comparison purposes as you use your
                 predictor and the metrics change.

                 (structure)
                     An  individual  metric that you can use for comparison as
                     you evaluate your monitoring results.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the metric.

                     Value -> (double)
                        The value for the metric.

       Message -> (string)
          An error message, if any, for the monitor.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp for when the monitor resource was created.

       LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of the latest modification to the monitor.

       EstimatedEvaluationTimeRemainingInMinutes -> (long)
          The estimated number of minutes remaining  before  the  monitor  re-
          source finishes its current evaluation.
