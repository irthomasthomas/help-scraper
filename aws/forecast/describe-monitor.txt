DESCRIBE-MONITOR()                                          DESCRIBE-MONITOR()



NAME
       describe-monitor -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  a  monitor  resource.  In addition to listing the properties
       provided in the  CreateMonitor request, this operation lists  the  fol-
       lowing properties:

       o Baseline

       o CreationTime

       o LastEvaluationTime

       o LastEvaluationState

       o LastModificationTime

       o Message

       o Status

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-monitor
          --monitor-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --monitor-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the monitor resource to describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       MonitorName -> (string)
          The name of the monitor.

       MonitorArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the monitor resource described.

       ResourceArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  auto  predictor  being  moni-
          tored.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the monitor resource.

       LastEvaluationTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of the latest evaluation completed by the monitor.

       LastEvaluationState -> (string)
          The state of the monitor's latest evaluation.

       Baseline -> (structure)
          Metrics you can use as a baseline for comparison purposes. Use these
          values you interpret monitoring results for an auto predictor.

          PredictorBaseline -> (structure)
              The initial accuracy metrics for the predictor you are  monitor-
              ing.  Use these metrics as a baseline for comparison purposes as
              you use your predictor and the metrics change.

              BaselineMetrics -> (list)
                 The initial accuracy metrics for  the  predictor.  Use  these
                 metrics as a baseline for comparison purposes as you use your
                 predictor and the metrics change.

                 (structure)
                     An individual metric that you can use for  comparison  as
                     you evaluate your monitoring results.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the metric.

                     Value -> (double)
                        The value for the metric.

       Message -> (string)
          An error message, if any, for the monitor.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp for when the monitor resource was created.

       LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of the latest modification to the monitor.

       EstimatedEvaluationTimeRemainingInMinutes -> (long)
          The  estimated  number  of  minutes remaining before the monitor re-
          source finishes its current evaluation.
