CREATE-WHAT-IF-ANALYSIS()                            CREATE-WHAT-IF-ANALYSIS()



NAME
       create-what-if-analysis -

DESCRIPTION
       What-if  analysis is a scenario modeling technique where you make a hy-
       pothetical change to a time series and compare the forecasts  generated
       by these changes against the baseline, unchanged time series. It is im-
       portant to remember that the purpose of a what-if analysis is to under-
       stand  how  a  forecast can change given different modifications to the
       baseline time series.

       For example, imagine you are a clothing retailer who is considering  an
       end  of  season  sale  to  clear space for new styles. After creating a
       baseline forecast, you can use a what-if analysis  to  investigate  how
       different  sales  tactics  might  affect your goals. You could create a
       scenario where everything is given a 25% markdown and another where ev-
       erything  is  given  a fixed dollar markdown. You can create a scenario
       where the sale lasts for 1 week and another where the sale lasts for  1
       month. Your what-if analysis enables you to compare many different sce-
       narios against each other.

       Note that a what-if analysis is meant to display what  the  forecasting
       model  has learned and how it will behave in the scenarios that you are
       evaluating. Do not blindly use the results of the what-if  analysis  to
       make  business decisions. For instance, forecasts might not be accurate
       for novel scenarios where there is no reference available to  determine
       whether a forecast is good.

       The   TimeSeriesSelector  object defines the items that you want in the
       what-if analysis.

OPTIONS
       --what-if-analysis-name (string)
          The name of the what-if analysis. Each name must be unique.

       --forecast-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the baseline forecast.

       --time-series-selector (structure)
          Defines the set of time series that are used in the what-if analysis
          with  a TimeSeriesIdentifiers object. What-if analyses are performed
          only for the time series in this object.

          The TimeSeriesIdentifiers object needs the following information:

          o DataSource

          o Format

          o Schema

          TimeSeriesIdentifiers -> (structure)
              Details about the import file that contains the time series  for
              which you want to create forecasts.

              DataSource -> (structure)
                 The  source  of your data, an AWS Identity and Access Manage-
                 ment (IAM) role that allows Amazon  Forecast  to  access  the
                 data  and,  optionally,  an  AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
                 key.

                 S3Config -> (structure)
                     The path to the data stored in an Amazon  Simple  Storage
                     Service  (Amazon S3) bucket along with the credentials to
                     access the data.

                     Path -> (string)
                        The path to an Amazon Simple Storage  Service  (Amazon
                        S3) bucket or file(s) in an Amazon S3 bucket.

                     RoleArn -> (string)
                        The  ARN  of  the  AWS  Identity and Access Management
                        (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume  to  access
                        the  Amazon S3 bucket or files. If you provide a value
                        for the KMSKeyArn key, the role must allow  access  to
                        the key.

                        Passing  a role across AWS accounts is not allowed. If
                        you pass a role that isn't in your account, you get an
                        InvalidInputException error.

                     KMSKeyArn -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Key Manage-
                        ment Service (KMS) key.

              Schema -> (structure)
                 Defines the fields of a dataset.

                 Attributes -> (list)
                     An array of attributes specifying the name  and  type  of
                     each field in a dataset.

                     (structure)
                        An  attribute  of  a  schema,  which defines a dataset
                        field. A schema attribute is required for every  field
                        in  a  dataset. The Schema object contains an array of
                        SchemaAttribute objects.

                        AttributeName -> (string)
                            The name of the dataset field.

                        AttributeType -> (string)
                            The data type of the field.

                            For a related  time  series  dataset,  other  than
                            date, item_id, and forecast dimensions attributes,
                            all attributes should be of numerical type  (inte-
                            ger/float).

              Format -> (string)
                 The format of the data, either CSV or PARQUET.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TimeSeriesIdentifiers": {
              "DataSource": {
                "S3Config": {
                  "Path": "string",
                  "RoleArn": "string",
                  "KMSKeyArn": "string"
                }
              },
              "Schema": {
                "Attributes": [
                  {
                    "AttributeName": "string",
                    "AttributeType": "string"|"integer"|"float"|"timestamp"|"geolocation"
                  }
                  ...
                ]
              },
              "Format": "string"
            }
          }

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags to apply to the what if forecast.

          (structure)
              The  optional  metadata that you apply to a resource to help you
              categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and  an
              optional value, both of which you define.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

              o For  each  resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

              o If your tagging schema is used across  multiple  services  and
                resources,  remember that other services may have restrictions
                on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are:  let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of  such  as  a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use.
                You cannot edit or delete tag keys with  this  prefix.  Values
                can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but
                the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user  tag
                and  will  count  against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only
                the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags  per  re-
                source limit.

              Key -> (string)
                 One  part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       WhatIfAnalysisArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the what-if analysis.
