NAME
       describe-forecast -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes a forecast created using the  CreateForecast operation.

       In  addition  to  listing the properties provided in the CreateForecast
       request, this operation lists the following properties:

       o DatasetGroupArn - The dataset group that provided the training data.

       o CreationTime

       o LastModificationTime

       o Status

       o Message - If an error occurred, information about the error.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-forecast
          --forecast-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --forecast-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the forecast.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ForecastArn -> (string)
          The forecast ARN as specified in the request.

       ForecastName -> (string)
          The name of the forecast.

       ForecastTypes -> (list)
          The quantiles at which probabilistic forecasts were generated.

          (string)

       PredictorArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the predictor used to generate the forecast.

       DatasetGroupArn -> (string)
          The  ARN  of  the dataset group that provided the data used to train
          the predictor.

       EstimatedTimeRemainingInMinutes -> (long)
          The estimated time remaining in minutes for the forecast job to com-
          plete.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the forecast. States include:

          o ACTIVE

          o CREATE_PENDING , CREATE_IN_PROGRESS , CREATE_FAILED

          o CREATE_STOPPING , CREATE_STOPPED

          o DELETE_PENDING , DELETE_IN_PROGRESS , DELETE_FAILED

          NOTE:
              The  Status  of the forecast must be ACTIVE before you can query
              or export the forecast.

       Message -> (string)
          If an error occurred, an informational message about the error.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          When the forecast creation task was created.

       LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
          The last time the resource was modified. The  timestamp  depends  on
          the status of the job:

          o CREATE_PENDING - The CreationTime .

          o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS - The current timestamp.

          o CREATE_STOPPING - The current timestamp.

          o CREATE_STOPPED - When the job stopped.

          o ACTIVE or CREATE_FAILED - When the job finished or failed.

       TimeSeriesSelector -> (structure)
          The time series to include in the forecast.

          TimeSeriesIdentifiers -> (structure)
              Details  about the import file that contains the time series for
              which you want to create forecasts.

              DataSource -> (structure)
                 The source of your data, an AWS Identity and  Access  Manage-
                 ment  (IAM)  role  that  allows Amazon Forecast to access the
                 data and, optionally, an AWS  Key  Management  Service  (KMS)
                 key.

                 S3Config -> (structure)
                     The  path  to the data stored in an Amazon Simple Storage
                     Service (Amazon S3) bucket along with the credentials  to
                     access the data.

                     Path -> (string)
                        The  path  to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon
                        S3) bucket or file(s) in an Amazon S3 bucket.

                     RoleArn -> (string)
                        The ARN of the  AWS  Identity  and  Access  Management
                        (IAM)  role  that Amazon Forecast can assume to access
                        the Amazon S3 bucket or files. If you provide a  value
                        for  the  KMSKeyArn key, the role must allow access to
                        the key.

                        Passing a role across AWS accounts is not allowed.  If
                        you pass a role that isn't in your account, you get an
                        InvalidInputException error.

                     KMSKeyArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS  Key  Manage-
                        ment Service (KMS) key.

              Schema -> (structure)
                 Defines the fields of a dataset.

                 Attributes -> (list)
                     An  array  of  attributes specifying the name and type of
                     each field in a dataset.

                     (structure)
                        An attribute of a  schema,  which  defines  a  dataset
                        field.  A schema attribute is required for every field
                        in a dataset. The Schema object contains an  array  of
                        SchemaAttribute objects.

                        AttributeName -> (string)
                            The name of the dataset field.

                        AttributeType -> (string)
                            The data type of the field.

                            For  a  related  time  series  dataset, other than
                            date, item_id, and forecast dimensions attributes,
                            all  attributes should be of numerical type (inte-
                            ger/float).
