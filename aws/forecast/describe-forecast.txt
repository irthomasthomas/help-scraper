OPTIONS
       --forecast-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the forecast.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

          When the forecast creation task was created.

          The last time the resource was modified. The  timestamp  depends  on
          the status of the job:

                 The source of your data, an AWS Identity and  Access  Manage-
                 ment  (IAM)  role  that  allows Amazon Forecast to access the
                 data and, optionally, an AWS  Key  Management  Service  (KMS)
                 key.

                 S3Config -> (structure)
                     The  path  to the data stored in an Amazon Simple Storage
                     Service (Amazon S3) bucket along with the credentials  to
                     access the data.

                     Path -> (string)
                        The  path  to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon
                        S3) bucket or file(s) in an Amazon S3 bucket.

                     RoleArn -> (string)
                        The ARN of the  AWS  Identity  and  Access  Management
                        (IAM)  role  that Amazon Forecast can assume to access
                        the Amazon S3 bucket or files. If you provide a  value
                        for  the  KMSKeyArn key, the role must allow access to
                        the key.

                        Passing a role across AWS accounts is not allowed.  If
                        you pass a role that isn't in your account, you get an
                        InvalidInputException error.

                     KMSKeyArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS  Key  Manage-

                        An attribute of a  schema,  which  defines  a  dataset
                        field.  A schema attribute is required for every field
                        in a dataset. The Schema object contains an  array  of
                        SchemaAttribute objects.
