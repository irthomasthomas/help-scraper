LIST-FORECAST-EXPORT-JOBS()                        LIST-FORECAST-EXPORT-JOBS()



NAME
       list-forecast-export-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of forecast export jobs created using the  CreateFore-
       castExportJob operation. For each forecast export job,  this  operation
       returns a summary of its properties, including its Amazon Resource Name
       (ARN). To retrieve the complete set of properties, use the ARN with the
       DescribeForecastExportJob  operation.  You can filter the list using an
       array of  Filter objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-forecast-export-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: ForecastExportJobs

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An  array of filters. For each filter, you provide a condition and a
          match statement. The condition is either IS or IS_NOT , which speci-
          fies  whether  to  include  or exclude the forecast export jobs that
          match the statement from the list, respectively. The match statement
          consists of a key and a value.
              Filter properties

          o Condition - The condition to apply. Valid values are IS and IS_NOT
            . To include the forecast export jobs that  match  the  statement,
            specify  IS  .  To  exclude matching forecast export jobs, specify
            IS_NOT .

          o Key - The name of the parameter to filter  on.  Valid  values  are
            ForecastArn and Status .

          o Value - The value to match.

          For example, to list all jobs that export a forecast named electric-
          ityforecast , specify the following filter:
              "Filters": [ { "Condition": "IS", "Key": "ForecastArn", "Value":
              "arn:aws:forecast:us-west-2:<acct-id>:forecast/electricityfore-
              cast" } ]

          (structure)
              Describes a filter for choosing a subset of objects. Each filter
              consists  of a condition and a match statement. The condition is
              either IS or IS_NOT , which specifies whether to include or  ex-
              clude  the  objects  that match the statement, respectively. The
              match statement consists of a key and a value.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the parameter to filter on.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value to match.

              Condition -> (string)
                 The condition to apply. To include the objects that match the
                 statement,  specify IS . To exclude matching objects, specify
                 IS_NOT .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,Condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "Condition": "IS"|"IS_NOT"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       ForecastExportJobs -> (list)
          An array of objects that summarize each export job's properties.

          (structure)
              Provides a summary of the forecast export job properties used in
              the   ListForecastExportJobs  operation. To get the complete set
              of properties, call  the   DescribeForecastExportJob  operation,
              and provide the listed ForecastExportJobArn .

              ForecastExportJobArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the forecast export job.

              ForecastExportJobName -> (string)
                 The name of the forecast export job.

              Destination -> (structure)
                 The  path  to  the  Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
                 bucket where the forecast is exported.

                 S3Config -> (structure)
                     The path to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon  S3)
                     bucket along with the credentials to access the bucket.

                     Path -> (string)
                        The  path  to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon
                        S3) bucket or file(s) in an Amazon S3 bucket.

                     RoleArn -> (string)
                        The ARN of the Identity and  Access  Management  (IAM)
                        role  that  Amazon  Forecast  can assume to access the
                        Amazon S3 bucket or files. If you provide a value  for
                        the  KMSKeyArn  key, the role must allow access to the
                        key.

                        Passing a role across Amazon Web Services accounts  is
                        not allowed. If you pass a role that isn't in your ac-
                        count, you get an InvalidInputException error.

                     KMSKeyArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  an  Key  Management
                        Service (KMS) key.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the forecast export job. States include:

                 o ACTIVE

                 o CREATE_PENDING , CREATE_IN_PROGRESS , CREATE_FAILED

                 o CREATE_STOPPING , CREATE_STOPPED

                     The  Status of the forecast export job must be ACTIVE be-
                     fore you can access the forecast in your S3 bucket.

              Message -> (string)
                 If an error occurred, an informational message about the  er-
                 ror.
