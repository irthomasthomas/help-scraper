LIST-EXPLAINABILITY-EXPORTS()                    LIST-EXPLAINABILITY-EXPORTS()



NAME
       list-explainability-exports -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of Explainability exports created using the  CreateEx-
       plainabilityExport operation. This operation returns a summary for each
       Explainability  export. You can filter the list using an array of  Fil-
       ter objects.

       To retrieve the complete set of properties for  a  particular  Explain-
       ability export, use the ARN with the  DescribeExplainability operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-explainability-exports  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: ExplainabilityExports

SYNOPSIS
            list-explainability-exports
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An array of filters. For each filter,  provide  a  condition  and  a
          match statement. The condition is either IS or IS_NOT , which speci-
          fies whether to include or exclude resources that match  the  state-
          ment  from  the  list.  The  match statement consists of a key and a
          value.
              Filter properties

          o Condition - The condition to apply. Valid values are IS and IS_NOT
            .

          o Key - The name of the parameter to filter on. Valid values are Re-
            sourceArn and Status .

          o Value - The value to match.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter for choosing a subset of objects. Each filter
              consists  of a condition and a match statement. The condition is
              either IS or IS_NOT , which specifies whether to include or  ex-
              clude  the  objects  that match the statement, respectively. The
              match statement consists of a key and a value.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the parameter to filter on.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value to match.

              Condition -> (string)
                 The condition to apply. To include the objects that match the
                 statement,  specify IS . To exclude matching objects, specify
                 IS_NOT .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,Condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "Condition": "IS"|"IS_NOT"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ExplainabilityExports -> (list)
          An array of objects that summarize the properties of  each  Explain-
          ability export.

          (structure)
              Provides  a summary of the Explainability export properties used
              in the  ListExplainabilityExports operation. To get  a  complete
              set of properties, call the  DescribeExplainabilityExport opera-
              tion, and provide the ExplainabilityExportArn .

              ExplainabilityExportArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Explainability export.

              ExplainabilityExportName -> (string)
                 The name of the Explainability export

              Destination -> (structure)
                 The destination for an export job. Provide an S3 path, an AWS
                 Identity  and Access Management (IAM) role that allows Amazon
                 Forecast to access the location, and an  AWS  Key  Management
                 Service (KMS) key (optional).

                 S3Config -> (structure)
                     The  path to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
                     bucket along with the credentials to access the bucket.

                     Path -> (string)
                        The path to an Amazon Simple Storage  Service  (Amazon
                        S3) bucket or file(s) in an Amazon S3 bucket.

                     RoleArn -> (string)
                        The  ARN  of  the  AWS  Identity and Access Management
                        (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume  to  access
                        the  Amazon S3 bucket or files. If you provide a value
                        for the KMSKeyArn key, the role must allow  access  to
                        the key.

                        Passing  a role across AWS accounts is not allowed. If
                        you pass a role that isn't in your account, you get an
                        InvalidInputException error.

                     KMSKeyArn -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Key Manage-
                        ment Service (KMS) key.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the Explainability export. States include:

                 o ACTIVE

                 o CREATE_PENDING , CREATE_IN_PROGRESS , CREATE_FAILED

                 o CREATE_STOPPING , CREATE_STOPPED

                 o DELETE_PENDING , DELETE_IN_PROGRESS , DELETE_FAILED

              Message -> (string)
                 Information about any errors that may  have  occurred  during
                 the Explainability export.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the Explainability was created.

              LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  last  time  the resource was modified. The timestamp de-
                 pends on the status of the job:

                 o CREATE_PENDING - The CreationTime .

                 o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS - The current timestamp.

                 o CREATE_STOPPING - The current timestamp.

                 o CREATE_STOPPED - When the job stopped.

                 o ACTIVE or CREATE_FAILED - When the job finished or failed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Returns this token if the response is  truncated.  To  retrieve  the
          next set of results, use the token in the next request.
