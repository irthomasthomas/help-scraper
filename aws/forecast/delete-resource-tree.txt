DELETE-RESOURCE-TREE()                                  DELETE-RESOURCE-TREE()



NAME
       delete-resource-tree -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  an entire resource tree. This operation will delete the parent
       resource and its child resources.

       Child resources are resources that were created from another  resource.
       For  example,  when a forecast is generated from a predictor, the fore-
       cast is the child resource and the predictor is the parent resource.

       Amazon Forecast resources possess the following  parent-child  resource
       hierarchies:

       o Dataset : dataset import jobs

       o Dataset  Group  :  predictors,  predictor backtest export jobs, fore-
         casts, forecast export jobs

       o Predictor : predictor backtest export jobs, forecasts,  forecast  ex-
         port jobs

       o Forecast : forecast export jobs

       NOTE:
          DeleteResourceTree  will  only delete Amazon Forecast resources, and
          will not delete datasets or exported files stored in Amazon S3.

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the parent resource to delete. All
          child resources of the parent resource will also be deleted.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
