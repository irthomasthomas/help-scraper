CREATE-WHAT-IF-FORECAST-EXPORT()              CREATE-WHAT-IF-FORECAST-EXPORT()



NAME
       create-what-if-forecast-export -

DESCRIPTION
       Exports  a  forecast  created by the  CreateWhatIfForecast operation to
       your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon  S3)  bucket.  The  forecast
       file name will match the following conventions:
          <ForecastExportJobName>_<ExportTimestamp>_<PartNumber>

       The   <ExportTimestamp>   component   is   in   Java   SimpleDateFormat
       (yyyy-MM-ddTHH-mm-ssZ).

       You must specify a  DataDestination object that  includes  an  Identity
       and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to ac-
       cess the  Amazon  S3  bucket.  For  more  information,  see   aws-fore-
       cast-iam-roles .

       For more information, see  howitworks-forecast .

       To  get a list of all your what-if forecast export jobs, use the  List-
       WhatIfForecastExports operation.

       NOTE:
          The Status of the forecast export job must be ACTIVE before you  can
          access the forecast in your Amazon S3 bucket. To get the status, use
          the  DescribeWhatIfForecastExport operation.

OPTIONS
       --what-if-forecast-export-name (string)
          The name of the what-if forecast to export.

       --what-if-forecast-arns (list)
          The list of what-if forecast Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to export.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --destination (structure)
          The location where you want to save the forecast and an Identity and
          Access  Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to ac-
          cess the location. The forecast must be exported  to  an  Amazon  S3
          bucket.

          If  encryption  is  used, Destination must include an Key Management
          Service (KMS) key. The IAM role must allow Amazon  Forecast  permis-
          sion to access the key.

          S3Config -> (structure)
              The  path to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket
              along with the credentials to access the bucket.

              Path -> (string)
                 The path to an Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service  (Amazon  S3)
                 bucket or file(s) in an Amazon S3 bucket.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that
                 Amazon Forecast can assume to access the Amazon S3 bucket  or
                 files. If you provide a value for the KMSKeyArn key, the role
                 must allow access to the key.

                 Passing a role across Amazon Web Services accounts is not al-
                 lowed. If you pass a role that isn't in your account, you get
                 an InvalidInputException error.

              KMSKeyArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Key  Management  Service
                 (KMS) key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Config={Path=string,RoleArn=string,KMSKeyArn=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Config": {
              "Path": "string",
              "RoleArn": "string",
              "KMSKeyArn": "string"
            }
          }

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags to apply to the what if forecast.

          (structure)
              The  optional  metadata that you apply to a resource to help you
              categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and  an
              optional value, both of which you define.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

              o For  each  resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

              o If your tagging schema is used across  multiple  services  and
                resources,  remember that other services may have restrictions
                on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are:  let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of  such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon Web
                Services use. You cannot edit or delete  tag  keys  with  this
                prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as
                its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to
                be  a  user  tag  and will count against the limit of 50 tags.
                Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your
                tags per resource limit.

              Key -> (string)
                 One  part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --format (string)
          The format of the exported data, CSV or PARQUET.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       WhatIfForecastExportArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the what-if forecast.
