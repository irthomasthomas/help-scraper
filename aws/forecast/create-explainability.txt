CREATE-EXPLAINABILITY()                                CREATE-EXPLAINABILITY()



NAME
       create-explainability -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          Explainability is only available for Forecasts and Predictors gener-
          ated from an AutoPredictor ( CreateAutoPredictor )

       Creates an Amazon Forecast Explainability.

       Explainability helps you better understand how the attributes  in  your
       datasets  impact  forecast. Amazon Forecast uses a metric called Impact
       scores to quantify the relative impact of each attribute and  determine
       whether they increase or decrease forecast values.

       To enable Forecast Explainability, your predictor must include at least
       one of the following: related time series, item metadata, or additional
       datasets like Holidays and the Weather Index.

       CreateExplainability accepts either a Predictor ARN or Forecast ARN. To
       receive aggregated Impact scores for all time series and time points in
       your  datasets,  provide  a Predictor ARN. To receive Impact scores for
       specific time series and time points, provide a Forecast ARN.
          CreateExplainability with a Predictor ARN

       NOTE:
          You can only have one Explainability resource per predictor. If  you
          already enabled ExplainPredictor in  CreateAutoPredictor , that pre-
          dictor already has an Explainability resource.

       The following parameters are required when providing a Predictor ARN:

       o ExplainabilityName - A unique name for the Explainability.

       o ResourceArn - The Arn of the predictor.

       o TimePointGranularity - Must be set to ALL.

       o TimeSeriesGranularity - Must be set to ALL.

       Do not specify a value for the following parameters:

       o DataSource - Only valid when TimeSeriesGranularity is SPECIFIC.

       o Schema - Only valid when TimeSeriesGranularity is SPECIFIC.

       o StartDateTime - Only valid when TimePointGranularity is SPECIFIC.

       o EndDateTime - Only valid when TimePointGranularity is SPECIFIC.
          CreateExplainability with a Forecast ARN

       NOTE:
          You can specify a maximum of 50 time series and 500 time points.

       The following parameters are required when providing a Predictor ARN:

       o ExplainabilityName - A unique name for the Explainability.

       o ResourceArn - The Arn of the forecast.

       o TimePointGranularity - Either ALL or SPECIFIC.

       o TimeSeriesGranularity - Either ALL or SPECIFIC.

       If you set TimeSeriesGranularity to SPECIFIC, you must also provide the
       following:

       o DataSource - The S3 location of the CSV file specifying your time se-
         ries.

       o Schema - The Schema defines the attributes and attribute types listed
         in the Data Source.

       If  you set TimePointGranularity to SPECIFIC, you must also provide the
       following:

       o StartDateTime - The first timestamp in the range of time points.

       o EndDateTime - The last timestamp in the range of time points.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TimeSeriesGranularity=string,TimePointGranularity=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TimeSeriesGranularity": "ALL"|"SPECIFIC",
            "TimePointGranularity": "ALL"|"SPECIFIC"
          }

       --data-source (structure)
          The  source  of  your  data, an Identity and Access Management (IAM)
          role that allows Amazon Forecast to access the data and, optionally,
          an Key Management Service (KMS) key.

          S3Config -> (structure)
              The  path to the data stored in an Amazon Simple Storage Service
              (Amazon S3) bucket along with  the  credentials  to  access  the
              data.

              Path -> (string)
                 The  path  to  an  Amazon  Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)

                 must allow access to the key.

                 Passing a role across Amazon Web Services accounts is not al-
                 lowed. If you pass a role that isn't in your account, you get
                 an InvalidInputException error.

          Attributes -> (list)
              An array of attributes specifying the  name  and  type  of  each
              field in a dataset.

              (structure)
                 An  attribute  of  a schema, which defines a dataset field. A
                 schema attribute is required for every field  in  a  dataset.
                 The  Schema  object  contains an array of SchemaAttribute ob-
                 jects.

                 AttributeName -> (string)

                     tributes should be of numerical type (integer/float).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Attributes=[{AttributeName=string,AttributeType=string},{AttributeName=string,AttributeType=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Attributes": [
              {
                "AttributeName": "string",
                "AttributeType": "string"|"integer"|"float"|"timestamp"|"geolocation"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --enable-visualization | --no-enable-visualization (boolean)
          Create an Explainability visualization that is viewable  within  the
          Amazon Web Services console.

       --start-date-time (string)
          If  TimePointGranularity is set to SPECIFIC , define the first point
          for the Explainability.

          Use the following timestamp  format:  yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss  (example:
          2015-01-01T20:00:00)

       --end-date-time (string)
          If  TimePointGranularity  is  set to SPECIFIC , define the last time
          point for the Explainability.

          Use the following timestamp  format:  yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss  (example:
          2015-01-01T20:00:00)

       --tags (list)
          Optional  metadata  to  help  you  categorize  and organize your re-
          sources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value,  both  of
          which you define. Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

          The following restrictions apply to tags:

          o For  each  resource,  each tag key must be unique and each tag key
            must have one value.

          o Maximum number of tags per resource: 50.

          o Maximum key length: 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o Maximum value length: 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o Accepted characters: all letters and numbers, spaces representable
            in  UTF-8,  and  +  -  = . _ : / @. If your tagging schema is used
            across other services and resources, the character restrictions of
            those services also apply.

          o Key  prefixes cannot include any upper or lowercase combination of
            aws: or AWS: . Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws
            as  its prefix but the key does not, Forecast considers it to be a
            user tag and will count against the limit of 50  tags.  Tags  with
            only  the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags per re-
            source limit. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix.

          (structure)
              The optional metadata that you apply to a resource to  help  you
              categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an
              optional value, both of which you define.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

              o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and  each  tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

              o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and
                resources, remember that other services may have  restrictions
                on  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon  Web
                Services  use.  You  cannot  edit or delete tag keys with this
                prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as
                its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to
                be a user tag and will count against the  limit  of  50  tags.
                Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your
                tags per resource limit.

              Key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A key is  a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag.  A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
