LIST-FORECASTS()                                              LIST-FORECASTS()



NAME
       list-forecasts -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of forecasts created using the  CreateForecast opera-
       tion. For each forecast, this operation returns a summary of its  prop-
       erties,  including its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). To retrieve the com-
       plete set of properties, specify the ARN with the  DescribeForecast op-
       eration. You can filter the list using an array of  Filter objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-forecasts  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Forecasts

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An array of filters. For each filter, you provide a condition and  a
          match statement. The condition is either IS or IS_NOT , which speci-
          fies whether to include or exclude  the  forecasts  that  match  the
          statement  from the list, respectively. The match statement consists
          of a key and a value.
              Filter properties

          o Condition - The condition to apply. Valid values are IS and IS_NOT
            .  To include the forecasts that match the statement, specify IS .
            To exclude matching forecasts, specify IS_NOT .

          o Key - The name of the parameter to filter  on.  Valid  values  are
            DatasetGroupArn , PredictorArn , and Status .

          o Value - The value to match.

          For  example,  to list all forecasts whose status is not ACTIVE, you
          would specify:
              "Filters": [ { "Condition": "IS_NOT", "Key": "Status",  "Value":
              "ACTIVE" } ]

          (structure)
              Describes a filter for choosing a subset of objects. Each filter
              consists of a condition and a match statement. The condition  is
              either  IS or IS_NOT , which specifies whether to include or ex-
              clude the objects that match the  statement,  respectively.  The
              match statement consists of a key and a value.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the parameter to filter on.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value to match.

              Condition -> (string)
                 The condition to apply. To include the objects that match the
                 statement, specify IS . To exclude matching objects,  specify
                 IS_NOT .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,Condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "Condition": "IS"|"IS_NOT"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

          (structure)
              Provides a summary of the forecast properties used in the  List-
              Forecasts operation. To get the complete set of properties, call
              the   DescribeForecast  operation,  and  provide the ForecastArn
              that is listed in the summary.

              ForecastArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the forecast.

              ForecastName -> (string)
                 The name of the forecast.

              PredictorArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the predictor used to generate the forecast.

              CreatedUsingAutoPredictor -> (boolean)
                 Whether the Forecast was created from an AutoPredictor.

              DatasetGroupArn -> (string)

                 NOTE:
                     The  Status of the forecast must be ACTIVE before you can
                     query or export the forecast.

              Message -> (string)

                 The  last  time  the resource was modified. The timestamp de-
                 pends on the status of the job:

                 o CREATE_PENDING - The CreationTime .

                 o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS - The current timestamp.

                 o CREATE_STOPPING - The current timestamp.
