OPTIONS
       --explainability-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Explaianability to describe.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Explainability.

       ExplainabilityName -> (string)
          The name of the Explainability.

       ResourceArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Predictor or Forecast used to

       ExplainabilityConfig -> (structure)
          The configuration settings that define the granularity of  time  se-
          ries and time points for the Explainability.

          TimeSeriesGranularity -> (string)
              To  create  an  Explainability  for  all  time  series  in  your
              datasets, use ALL . To create  an  Explainability  for  specific
              time series in your datasets, use SPECIFIC .

              Specify  time  series  by  uploading a CSV or Parquet file to an
              Amazon S3 bucket and set the location within  the   DataDestina-
              tion data type.

          TimePointGranularity -> (string)
              To create an Explainability for all time points in your forecast
              horizon, use ALL . To create an Explainability for specific time
              points in your forecast horizon, use SPECIFIC .

              Specify  time  points with the StartDateTime and EndDateTime pa-
              rameters within the  CreateExplainability operation.

       EnableVisualization -> (boolean)
          Whether the visualization was enabled  for  the  Explainability  re-
          source.

       DataSource -> (structure)
          The  source  of  your  data, an Identity and Access Management (IAM)
          role that allows Amazon Forecast to access the data and, optionally,
          an Key Management Service (KMS) key.

          S3Config -> (structure)
              The  path to the data stored in an Amazon Simple Storage Service
              (Amazon S3) bucket along with  the  credentials  to  access  the
              data.

              Path -> (string)
                 The  path  to  an  Amazon  Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
                 bucket or file(s) in an Amazon S3 bucket.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that
                 Amazon  Forecast can assume to access the Amazon S3 bucket or
                 files. If you provide a value for the KMSKeyArn key, the role
                 must allow access to the key.

                 Passing a role across Amazon Web Services accounts is not al-
                 lowed. If you pass a role that isn't in your account, you get

                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of an Key Management Service
                 (KMS) key.

       Schema -> (structure)
          Defines the fields of a dataset.

          Attributes -> (list)
              An array of attributes specifying the  name  and  type  of  each
              field in a dataset.

              (structure)
                 An  attribute  of  a schema, which defines a dataset field. A
                 schema attribute is required for every field  in  a  dataset.
                 The  Schema  object  contains an array of SchemaAttribute ob-
                 jects.

                     The name of the dataset field.

                 AttributeType -> (string)
                     The data type of the field.

                     For a related  time  series  dataset,  other  than  date,
                     item_id,  and  forecast  dimensions  attributes,  all at-
                     tributes should be of numerical type (integer/float).

       StartDateTime -> (string)

          The status of the Explainability resource. States include:

          o ACTIVE

          o CREATE_PENDING , CREATE_IN_PROGRESS , CREATE_FAILED

          o CREATE_STOPPING , CREATE_STOPPED

          o DELETE_PENDING , DELETE_IN_PROGRESS , DELETE_FAILED

          When the Explainability resource was created.

       LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
