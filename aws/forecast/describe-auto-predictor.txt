OPTIONS
       --predictor-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the predictor.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                 tributes.

                 The following is an example using the RETAIL domain:
                     {

                     "AttributeName": "demand",

                     "Transformations": {"aggregation":  "sum",  "middlefill":
                     "zero", "backfill": "zero"}

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  attribute as specified in the schema.
                     Amazon Forecast supports the target field of  the  target
                     time series and the related time series datasets. For ex-
                     ample, for the RETAIL domain, the target is demand .

                     The method parameters (key-value pairs), which are a  map
                     of override parameters. Specify these parameters to over-
                     ride the default values. Related Time  Series  attributes
                     do not accept aggregation parameters.

                     The  following  list shows the parameters and their valid
                     values for the "filling" featurization method for a  Tar-
                     get Time Series dataset. Default values are bolded.

                     o aggregation : sum , avg , first , min , max

                     o frontfill : none

                     o middlefill  : zero , nan (not a number), value , median
                       , mean , min , max

                     o backfill : zero , nan , value , median , mean ,  min  ,
                       max

                     The  following  list shows the parameters and their valid
                     values for a Related  Time  Series  featurization  method
                     (there are no defaults):

                     o middlefill : zero , value , median , mean , min , max

                     o backfill : zero , value , median , mean , min , max

                     o futurefill : zero , value , median , mean , min , max

                     To set a filling method to a specific value, set the fill
                     parameter to value and define the value in a  correspond-
                     ing  _value parameter. For example, to set backfilling to
                     a value of 2, include the following: "backfill":  "value"
                     and "backfill_value":"2" .
