LIST-MONITORS()                                                LIST-MONITORS()



NAME
       list-monitors -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of monitors created with the  CreateMonitor operation
       and  CreateAutoPredictor operation. For each monitor resource, this op-
       eration  returns  of  a summary of its properties, including its Amazon
       Resource Name (ARN). You can retrieve a complete set of properties of a
       monitor  resource  by specify the monitor's ARN in the  DescribeMonitor
       operation.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-monitors is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Monitors

SYNOPSIS
            list-monitors
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An  array  of  filters.  For  each filter, provide a condition and a
          match statement. The condition is either IS or IS_NOT , which speci-
          fies  whether  to  include  or  exclude the resources that match the
          statement from the list. The match statement consists of a key and a
          value.
              Filter properties

          o Condition - The condition to apply. Valid values are IS and IS_NOT
            .

          o Key - The name of the parameter to filter on. The only valid value
            is Status .

          o Value - The value to match.

          For  example, to list all monitors who's status is ACTIVE, you would
          specify:
              "Filters": [ { "Condition": "IS", "Key": "Status", "Value": "AC-
              TIVE" } ]

          (structure)
              Describes a filter for choosing a subset of objects. Each filter
              consists of a condition and a match statement. The condition  is
              either  IS or IS_NOT , which specifies whether to include or ex-
              clude the objects that match the  statement,  respectively.  The
              match statement consists of a key and a value.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the parameter to filter on.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value to match.

              Condition -> (string)
                 The condition to apply. To include the objects that match the
                 statement, specify IS . To exclude matching objects,  specify
                 IS_NOT .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,Condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "Condition": "IS"|"IS_NOT"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Monitors -> (list)
          An array of objects that summarize each monitor's properties.

          (structure)
              Provides  a summary of the monitor properties used in the  List-
              Monitors operation. To get a complete set  of  properties,  call
              the   DescribeMonitor  operation,  and  provide the listed Moni-
              torArn .

              MonitorArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the monitor resource.

              MonitorName -> (string)
                 The name of the monitor resource.

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the predictor  being  moni-
                 tored.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the monitor. States include:

                 o ACTIVE

                 o ACTIVE_STOPPING , ACTIVE_STOPPED

                 o UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS

                 o CREATE_PENDING , CREATE_IN_PROGRESS , CREATE_FAILED

                 o DELETE_PENDING , DELETE_IN_PROGRESS , DELETE_FAILED

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the monitor resource was created.

              LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  last  time  the monitor resource was modified. The time-
                 stamp depends on the status of the job:

                 o CREATE_PENDING - The CreationTime .

                 o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS - The current timestamp.

                 o STOPPED - When the resource stopped.

                 o ACTIVE or CREATE_FAILED - When the  monitor  creation  fin-
                   ished or failed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon Forecast returns this token. To
          retrieve the next set of results, use the token in the next request.
