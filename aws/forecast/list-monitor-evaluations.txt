LIST-MONITOR-EVALUATIONS()                          LIST-MONITOR-EVALUATIONS()



NAME
       list-monitor-evaluations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  the  monitoring  evaluation results and predictor
       events collected by the monitor resource during  different  windows  of
       time.

       For  information  about monitoring see  predictor-monitoring . For more
       information about retrieving monitoring results see Viewing  Monitoring
       Results .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-monitor-evaluations  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: PredictorMonitorEvaluations

SYNOPSIS
            list-monitor-evaluations
          --monitor-arn <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --monitor-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the monitor resource  to  get  re-
          sults from.

       --filters (list)
          An  array  of  filters.  For  each filter, provide a condition and a
          match statement. The condition is either IS or IS_NOT , which speci-
          fies  whether  to  include  or  exclude the resources that match the
          statement from the list. The match statement consists of a key and a
          value.
              Filter properties

          o Condition - The condition to apply. Valid values are IS and IS_NOT
            .

          o Key - The name of the parameter to filter on. The only valid value
            is EvaluationState .

          o Value - The value to match. Valid values are only SUCCESS or FAIL-
            URE .

          For example, to list only successful monitor evaluations, you  would
          specify:
              "Filters":  [  {  "Condition":  "IS",  "Key": "EvaluationState",
              "Value": "SUCCESS" } ]

          (structure)
              Describes a filter for choosing a subset of objects. Each filter
              consists  of a condition and a match statement. The condition is
              either IS or IS_NOT , which specifies whether to include or  ex-
              clude  the  objects  that match the statement, respectively. The
              match statement consists of a key and a value.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the parameter to filter on.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value to match.

              Condition -> (string)
                 The condition to apply. To include the objects that match the
                 statement,  specify IS . To exclude matching objects, specify
                 IS_NOT .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,Condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "Condition": "IS"|"IS_NOT"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon Forecast returns this token. To
          retrieve the next set of results, use the token in the next request.
          Tokens expire after 24 hours.

       PredictorMonitorEvaluations -> (list)
          The monitoring results and predictor events collected by the monitor
          resource during different windows of time.

                 A  list of metrics Forecast calculated when monitoring a pre-
                 dictor. You can compare the value for each metric in the list
                 to  the  metric's value in the  Baseline to see how your pre-
