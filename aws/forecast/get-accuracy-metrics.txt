NAME
       get-accuracy-metrics -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides metrics on the accuracy of the models that were trained by the
       CreatePredictor operation. Use metrics to see how well the  model  per-
       formed  and  to decide whether to use the predictor to generate a fore-
       cast. For more information, see Predictor Metrics .

       This operation generates metrics for  each  backtest  window  that  was
       evaluated. The number of backtest windows (NumberOfBacktestWindows ) is
       specified using the  EvaluationParameters object, which  is  optionally
       included  in  the  CreatePredictor  request. If NumberOfBacktestWindows
       isn't specified, the number defaults to one.

       The parameters of the filling method determine which  items  contribute
       to  the metrics. If you want all items to contribute, specify zero . If
       you want only those items that have complete data in  the  range  being
       evaluated  to contribute, specify nan . For more information, see  Fea-
       turizationMethod .

       NOTE:
          Before you can get accuracy metrics, the  Status  of  the  predictor
          must  be ACTIVE , signifying that training has completed. To get the
          status, use the  DescribePredictor operation.

OPTIONS
       --predictor-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the predictor to get metrics for.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                                   probability,  the  quantiles  would be 0.2,
                                   0.4, 0.6, and 0.8.

                            type.  Metrics  include   root-mean   square-error
                            (RMSE),  mean  absolute  percentage  error (MAPE),
                            mean absolute scaled error  (MASE),  and  weighted
                            average percentage error (WAPE).

                            (structure)
