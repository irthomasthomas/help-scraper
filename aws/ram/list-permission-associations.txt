       any resource shares that use this managed permission. This lets you see
       which  resource shares use which versions of the specified managed per-
       mission.

OPTIONS
       --permission-arn (string)
          Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the managed permission.

       --permission-version (integer)
          Specifies that you want to list only  those  associations  with  re-
          source  shares  that  use this version of the managed permission. If
          you don't provide a value for this parameter, then the operation re-
          turns  information  about associations with resource shares that use
          any version of the managed permission.

       --association-status (string)
          Specifies that you want to list only  those  associations  with  re-
          source shares that match this status.

          Possible values:

          o ASSOCIATING

          o ASSOCIATED

          o FAILED

          o DISASSOCIATING

          o DISASSOCIATED

       --resource-type (string)
          Specifies  that  you  want  to list only those associations with re-
          source shares that include at least one resource  of  this  resource
          type.

       --feature-set (string)
          Specifies  that  you  want  to list only those associations with re-
          source shares that have a featureSet with this value.

          Possible values:

          o CREATED_FROM_POLICY

          o PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD

          o STANDARD

       --default-version | --no-default-version (boolean)
          When true , specifies that you want to list only those  associations
          with  resource  shares that use the default version of the specified
          managed permission.

          When false (the default value),  lists  associations  with  resource
          shares that use any version of the specified managed permission.

       --next-token (string)
          Specifies  that  you want to receive the next page of results. Valid
          only if you received a NextToken response in the  previous  request.
          If you did, it indicates that more output is available. Set this pa-
          rameter to the value provided by the previous call's  NextToken  re-
          sponse to request the next page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the total number of results that you want included on each
          page of the response. If you do not include this parameter,  it  de-
          faults  to  a value that is specific to the operation. If additional
          items exist beyond the number you specify,  the  NextToken  response
          element  is  returned with a value (not null). Include the specified
          value as the NextToken request parameter in the next call to the op-
          eration  to  get the next part of the results. Note that the service
          might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more
          results  available. You should check NextToken after every operation
          to ensure that you receive all of the results.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       permissions -> (list)
          A structure with information about this customer managed permission.

          (structure)
              An  object that describes a managed permission associated with a
              resource share.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the associated managed per-
                 mission.

              permissionVersion -> (string)
                 The  version  of the permission currently associated with the
                 resource share.

              defaultVersion -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the associated resource share is using  the
                 default version of the permission.

              resourceType -> (string)
                 The resource type to which this permission applies.

              status -> (string)
                 The  current status of the association between the permission
                 and the resource share. The following are the  possible  val-
                 ues:

                 o ATTACHABLE   This  permission  or version can be associated
                   with resource shares.

                 o UNATTACHABLE  This permission or version can't currently be
                   associated with resource shares.

                 o DELETING   This  permission or version is in the process of
                   being deleted.

                 o DELETED  This permission or version is deleted.

              featureSet -> (string)
                 Indicates what  features  are  available  for  this  resource
                 share. This parameter can have one of the following values:

                 o STANDARD  A resource share that supports all functionality.
                   These resource shares are visible  to  all  principals  you
                   share  the  resource  share  with. You can modify these re-
                   source shares in RAM using the console or  APIs.  This  re-
                   source  share  might  have been created by RAM, or it might
                   have been CREATED_FROM_POLICY and then promoted.

                 o CREATED_FROM_POLICY  The customer  manually  shared  a  re-
                   source  by  attaching  a resource-based policy. That policy
                   did not match any existing managed permissions, so RAM cre-
                   ated  this customer managed permission automatically on the
                   customer's behalf based on the  attached  policy  document.
                   This  type  of resource share is visible only to the Amazon
                   Web Services account that created it. You can't  modify  it
                   in  RAM  unless  you  promote it. For more information, see
                   PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy .

                 o PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD  This resource share  was  originally
                   CREATED_FROM_POLICY  , but the customer ran the  PromoteRe-
                   sourceShareCreatedFromPolicy and that operation is still in
                   progress. This value changes to STANDARD when complete.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the association between the permission
                 and the resource share was last updated.

              resourceShareArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a resource share associated
                 with this permission.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  present, this value indicates that more output is available than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request  parameter  in a subsequent call to the operation to get the
          next part of the output. You should repeat this until the  NextToken
          response  element  comes  back as null . This indicates that this is
          the last page of results.
