LIST-PRINCIPALS()                                            LIST-PRINCIPALS()



NAME
       list-principals -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  principals  that you are sharing resources with or that are
       sharing resources with you.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-principals is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: principals

          NOTE:
              Not all resource types can be shared with IAM roles  and  users.
              For  more  information,  see Sharing with IAM roles and users in
              the Resource Access Manager User Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --resource-type (string)
          Specifies that you want to list information for only principals  as-
          sociated  with  resource  shares that include the specified resource
          type.

          For a list of valid values, query the  ListResourceTypes operation.

       --resource-share-arns (list)
          Specifies that you want to list information for only principals  as-
          sociated with the resource shares specified by a list the Amazon Re-
          source Names (ARNs) .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list principals with access to a resource

       The following list-principals example displays a list of the principals
       that can access resources of the specified type  through  any  resource
       shares.

          aws ram list-principals \
              --resource-type ec2:Subnet

       Output:

          {
              "principals": [
                  {
                      "id": "arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:ou/o-gx7EXAMPLE/ou-29c5-zEXAMPLE",
                      "resourceShareArn": "arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7ab63972-b505-7e2a-420d-6f5d3EXAMPLE",
                      "creationTime": 1565298209.737,
                      "lastUpdatedTime": 1565298211.019,
                      "external": false
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       principals -> (list)
          An array of objects that contain the details about the principals.

          (structure)
              Describes a principal for use with Resource Access Manager.

              id -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  the  principal that can be associated with a re-
                 source share.

              resourceShareArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a resource share the  prin-
                 cipal is associated with.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time when the principal was associated with the
                 resource share.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the association between  the  resource
                 share and the principal was last updated.

              external -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  the  relationship  between the Amazon Web Services
                 account the principal belongs to and the  account  that  owns
                 the resource share:

                 o True  The two accounts belong to same organization.

                 o False  The two accounts do not belong to the same organiza-
                   tion.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If present, this value indicates that more output is available  than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to  get  the
          next  part of the output. You should repeat this until the NextToken
          response element comes back as null . This indicates  that  this  is
          the last page of results.
