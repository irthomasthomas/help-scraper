OPTIONS
       --resource-type (string)
          Specifies that you want to list only those permissions that apply to
          the specified resource type. This parameter is not case sensitive.

          For  example, to list only permissions that apply to Amazon EC2 sub-
          nets, specify ec2:subnet . You can use the  ListResourceTypes opera-
          tion to get the specific string required.

       --next-token (string)
          Specifies  that  you want to receive the next page of results. Valid
          only if you received a NextToken response in the  previous  request.
          If you did, it indicates that more output is available. Set this pa-
          rameter to the value provided by the previous call's  NextToken  re-
          sponse to request the next page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the total number of results that you want included on each
          page of the response. If you do not include this parameter,  it  de-
          faults  to  a value that is specific to the operation. If additional
          items exist beyond the number you specify,  the  NextToken  response
          element  is  returned with a value (not null). Include the specified
          value as the NextToken request parameter in the next call to the op-
          eration  to  get the next part of the results. Note that the service
          might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more
          results  available. You should check NextToken after every operation
          to ensure that you receive all of the results.

       --permission-type (string)
          Specifies that you want to list only permissions of this type:

          o AWS  returns only Amazon Web Services managed permissions.

          o LOCAL  returns only customer managed permissions

          o ALL  returns both Amazon Web Services managed permissions and cus-
            tomer managed permissions.

          If you don't specify this parameter, the default is All .

          Possible values:

          o ALL

          o AWS_MANAGED

          o CUSTOMER_MANAGED

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       permissions -> (list)
          An array of objects with information about the permissions.

          (structure)
              Information about an RAM permission.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the permission you want in-
                 formation about.

              version -> (string)
                 The version of the permission associated with  this  resource
                 share.

              defaultVersion -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether the version of the managed permission used
                 by this resource share is the default version for  this  man-
                 aged permission.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of this managed permission.

              resourceType -> (string)
                 The  type  of resource to which this permission applies. This
                 takes the form  of:  service-code  :resource-code  ,  and  is
                 case-insensitive.  For example, an Amazon EC2 Subnet would be
                 represented by the string ec2:subnet .

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the permission.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the permission was created.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the permission was last updated.

              isResourceTypeDefault -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the managed permission associated with this
                 resource  share is the default managed permission for all re-
                 sources of this resource type.

              permissionType -> (string)
                 The type of managed permission. This can be one of  the  fol-
                 lowing values:

                 o AWS_MANAGED   Amazon  Web Services created and manages this
                   managed permission. You can associate it with your resource
                   shares, but you can't modify it.

                 o CUSTOMER_MANAGED  You, or another principal in your account
                   created this managed permission. You can associate it  with
                   your resource shares and create new versions that have dif-
                   ferent permissions.

              featureSet -> (string)
                 Indicates what  features  are  available  for  this  resource
                 share. This parameter can have one of the following values:

                 o STANDARD  A resource share that supports all functionality.
                   These resource shares are visible  to  all  principals  you
                   share  the  resource  share  with. You can modify these re-
                   source shares in RAM using the console or  APIs.  This  re-
                   source  share  might  have been created by RAM, or it might
                   have been CREATED_FROM_POLICY and then promoted.

                 o CREATED_FROM_POLICY  The customer  manually  shared  a  re-
                   source  by  attaching  a resource-based policy. That policy
                   did not match any existing managed permissions, so RAM cre-
                   ated  this customer managed permission automatically on the
                   customer's behalf based on the  attached  policy  document.
                   This  type  of resource share is visible only to the Amazon
                   Web Services account that created it. You can't  modify  it
                   in  RAM  unless  you  promote it. For more information, see
                   PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy .

                 o PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD  This resource share  was  originally
                   CREATED_FROM_POLICY  , but the customer ran the  PromoteRe-
                   sourceShareCreatedFromPolicy and that operation is still in
                   progress. This value changes to STANDARD when complete.

              tags -> (list)
                 A  list  of the tag key value pairs currently attached to the
                 permission.

                 (structure)
                     A structure containing a tag. A tag is metadata that  you
                     can attach to your resources to help organize and catego-
                     rize them. You can also use them to help you secure  your
                     resources.  For  more information, see Controlling access
                     to Amazon Web Services resources using tags .

                     For more information about tags, see Tagging  Amazon  Web
                     Services  resources  in  the  Amazon Web Services General
                     Reference Guide .

                     key -> (string)
                        The key, or name, attached to the tag. Every tag  must
                        have a key. Key names are case sensitive.

                     value -> (string)
                        The string value attached to the tag. The value can be
                        an empty string. Key values are case sensitive.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If present, this value indicates that more output is available  than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to  get  the
          next  part of the output. You should repeat this until the NextToken
          response element comes back as null . This indicates  that  this  is
          the last page of results.
