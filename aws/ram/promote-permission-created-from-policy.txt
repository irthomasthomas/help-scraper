PROMOTE-PERMISSION-CREATED-FROM-POLICYPROMOTE-PERMISSION-CREATED-FROM-POLICY()



NAME
       promote-permission-created-from-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       When  you  attach  a resource-based policy to a resource, RAM automati-
       cally creates a resource share of  featureSet  =``CREATED_FROM_POLICY``
       with  a  managed  permission  that  has the same IAM permissions as the
       original resource-based policy. However, this type of  managed  permis-
       sion  is  visible  to only the resource share owner, and the associated
       resource share can't be modified by using RAM.

       This operation creates a separate, fully  manageable  customer  managed
       permission  that  has  the  same  IAM  permissions  as the original re-
       source-based policy. You can associate this customer managed permission
       to any resource shares.

       Before  you  use   PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy  ,  you should
       first run this operation to ensure that you have  an  appropriate  cus-
       tomer  managed  permission that can be associated with the promoted re-
       source share.

       NOTE:

          o The original CREATED_FROM_POLICY policy  isn't  deleted,  and  re-
            source  shares using that original policy aren't automatically up-
            dated.

          o You can't modify a CREATED_FROM_POLICY resource share so you can't
            associate  the  new  customer  managed  permission by using Repla-
            cePermsissionAssociations . However, if you use   PromoteResource-
            ShareCreatedFromPolicy  ,  that operation automatically associates
            the fully manageable customer managed permission to the newly pro-
            moted STANDARD resource share.

          o After   you  promote  a  resource  share,  if  the  original  CRE-
            ATED_FROM_POLICY managed permission has no other associations to A
            resource share, then RAM automatically deletes it.

OPTIONS
       --permission-arn (string)
          Specifies  the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CREATED_FROM_POLICY
          permission that you want to promote. You can  get  this  Amazon  Re-
          source Name (ARN) by calling the  ListResourceSharePermissions oper-
          ation.

       --name (string)
          Specifies a name for the promoted customer managed permission.

       --client-token (string)
          Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that  you  provide  to
          ensure  the  idempotency  of the request. This lets you safely retry
          the request without accidentally performing  the  same  operation  a
          second  time. Passing the same value to a later call to an operation
          requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters.
          We recommend that you use a UUID type of value. .

          If  you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates
          a random one for you.

          If you retry the operation with the same ClientToken , but with dif-
          ferent  parameters,  the retry fails with an IdempotentParameterMis-
          match error.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       permission -> (structure)
          Information about an RAM permission.

          arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the permission you want infor-
              mation about.

          version -> (string)
              The version of the  permission  associated  with  this  resource
              share.

          defaultVersion -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether the version of the managed permission used by

              mission.

          name -> (string)
              The name of this managed permission.

          resourceType -> (string)
              The  type  of  resource  to  which this permission applies. This
              takes the form of: service-code :resource-code , and is case-in-
              sensitive.  For  example,  an  Amazon EC2 Subnet would be repre-
              sented by the string ec2:subnet .

          status -> (string)
              The current status of the permission.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the permission was created.

          lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the permission was last updated.

          isResourceTypeDefault -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the managed permission  associated  with  this
              resource  share  is  the  default managed permission for all re-
              sources of this resource type.

          permissionType -> (string)
              The type of managed permission. This can be one of the following
              values:

              o AWS_MANAGED  Amazon Web Services created and manages this man-
                aged permission. You  can  associate  it  with  your  resource
                shares, but you can't modify it.

              o CUSTOMER_MANAGED   You,  or  another principal in your account
                created this managed permission. You  can  associate  it  with
                your resource shares and create new versions that have differ-
                ent permissions.

          featureSet -> (string)
              Indicates what features are available for this  resource  share.
              This parameter can have one of the following values:

              o STANDARD   A  resource  share that supports all functionality.
                These resource shares are visible to all principals you  share
                the  resource share with. You can modify these resource shares
                in RAM using the console or APIs. This  resource  share  might
                have  been  created  by  RAM,  or  it  might  have  been  CRE-
                ATED_FROM_POLICY and then promoted.

              o CREATED_FROM_POLICY  The customer manually shared  a  resource
                by  attaching  a  resource-based  policy.  That policy did not
                match any existing managed permissions, so  RAM  created  this
                customer  managed  permission  automatically on the customer's
                behalf based on the attached policy document. This type of re-
                source  share  is  visible only to the Amazon Web Services ac-
                count that created it. You can't modify it in RAM  unless  you
                promote   it.  For  more  information,  see   PromoteResource-
                ShareCreatedFromPolicy .

              o PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD  This resource share was originally CRE-
                ATED_FROM_POLICY  , but the customer ran the  PromoteResource-
                ShareCreatedFromPolicy  and  that  operation   is   still   in
                progress. This value changes to STANDARD when complete.

          tags -> (list)
              A list of the tag key value pairs currently attached to the per-
              mission.

              (structure)
                 A structure containing a tag. A tag is metadata that you  can
                 attach  to  your  resources  to  help organize and categorize
                 them. You can also use them  to  help  you  secure  your  re-
                 sources. For more information, see Controlling access to Ama-
                 zon Web Services resources using tags .

                 For more information about tags, see Tagging Amazon Web  Ser-
                 vices  resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference
                 Guide .

                 key -> (string)
                     The key, or name, attached to the  tag.  Every  tag  must
                     have a key. Key names are case sensitive.

                 value -> (string)
                     The string value attached to the tag. The value can be an
                     empty string. Key values are case sensitive.

       clientToken -> (string)
          The idempotency identifier associated with this request. If you want
          to  repeat  the same operation in an idempotent manner then you must
          include this value in the  clientToken  request  parameter  of  that
          later call. All other parameters must also have the same values that
          you used in the first call.
