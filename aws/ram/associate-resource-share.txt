ASSOCIATE-RESOURCE-SHARE()                          ASSOCIATE-RESOURCE-SHARE()



NAME
       associate-resource-share -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  the  specified  list of principals and list of resources to a re-
       source share. Principals that already  have  access  to  this  resource
       share  immediately  receive  access to the added resources. Newly added
       principals immediately receive access to the resources shared  in  this
       resource share.

OPTIONS
       --resource-share-arn (string)
          Specifies  the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource share that
          you want to add principals or resources to.

       --resource-arns (list)
          Specifies a list of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)  of  the  resources
          that  you  want  to  share. This can be null if you want to add only
          principals.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --principals (list)
          Specifies a list of principals to whom  you  want  to  the  resource
          share. This can be null if you want to add only resources.

          What the principals can do with the resources in the share is deter-
          mined by the RAM permissions that you associate  with  the  resource
          share. See  AssociateResourceSharePermission .

          You can include the following values:

          o An Amazon Web Services account ID, for example: 123456789012

          o An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an organization in Organizations,
            for  example:  organizations::123456789012:organization/o-example-
            orgid

          o An  ARN of an organizational unit (OU) in Organizations, for exam-
            ple:     organizations::123456789012:ou/o-exampleorgid/ou-example-
            rootid-exampleouid123

          o An  ARN  of an IAM role, for example: iam::123456789012:role/role-
            name

          o An ARN of an IAM user, for example: iam::123456789012user/username

          NOTE:
              Not all resource types can be shared with IAM roles  and  users.
              For  more  information,  see Sharing with IAM roles and users in
              the Resource Access Manager User Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --client-token (string)
          Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that  you  provide  to
          ensure  the  idempotency  of the request. This lets you safely retry
          the request without accidentally performing  the  same  operation  a
          second  time. Passing the same value to a later call to an operation
          requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters.
          We recommend that you use a UUID type of value. .

          If  you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates
          a random one for you.

          If you retry the operation with the same ClientToken , but with dif-
          ferent  parameters,  the retry fails with an IdempotentParameterMis-
          match error.

       --sources (list)
          Specifies from which source accounts the service principal  has  ac-
          cess to the resources in this resource share.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To associate a resource with a resource share

       The  following associate-resource-share example adds a license configu-
       ration to the specified resource share.

          aws ram associate-resource-share \
              --resource-share arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/27d09b4b-5e12-41d1-a4f2-19dedEXAMPLE \
              --resource-arns arn:aws:license-manager:us-west-2:123456789012:license-configuration:lic-36be0485f5ae379cc74cf8e92EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "resourceShareAssociations": [
                  {
                     "resourceShareArn": "arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/27d09b4b-5e12-41d1-a4f2-19dedEXAMPLE",

                  }
              ]
          }

       Example 2: To associate a principal with a resource share

       The following associate-resource-share example grants  access  for  the
       specified  resource  share  to  all accounts in the specified organiza-
       tional unit.

          aws ram associate-resource-share \
              --resource-share-arn arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/27d09b4b-5e12-41d1-a4f2-19dedEXAMPLE \
              --principals arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:ou/o-63bEXAMPLE/ou-46xi-rEXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "resourceShareAssociations": [
                  {
                      "status": "ASSOCIATING",
                      "associationType": "PRINCIPAL",
                      "associatedEntity": "arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:ou/o-63bEXAMPLE/ou-46xi-rEXAMPLE",
                      "external": false,
                      "resourceShareArn": "arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/27d09b4b-5e12-41d1-a4f2-19dedEXAMPLE"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       resourceShareAssociations -> (list)
          An array of objects that contain information about the associations.

          (structure)
              Describes an association between a resource share and  either  a
              principal or a resource.

              resourceShareArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource share.

              resourceShareName -> (string)
                 The name of the resource share.

              associatedEntity -> (string)
                 The associated entity. This can be either of the following:

                 o For  a  resource  association,  this is the Amazon Resource
                   Name (ARN) of the resource.

                 o For principal associations, this is one of the following:

                   o The ID of an Amazon Web Services account

                   o The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an organization in  Or-
                     ganizations

                   o The ARN of an organizational unit (OU) in Organizations

              associationType -> (string)
                 The type of entity included in this association.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the association.

              statusMessage -> (string)
                 A message about the status of the association.

                 Indicates whether the principal belongs to the same organiza-
                 tion in Organizations as the Amazon Web Services account that
                 owns the resource share.

       clientToken -> (string)
          The idempotency identifier associated with this request. If you want
          to repeat the same operation in an idempotent manner then  you  must
          include  this  value  in  the  clientToken request parameter of that
          later call. All other parameters must also have the same values that
          you used in the first call.
