OPTIONS
       --resource-share-arn (string)
          Specifies  the  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource share for
          which you want to retrieve the associated permissions.

       --next-token (string)
          Specifies that you want to receive the next page of  results.  Valid
          only  if  you received a NextToken response in the previous request.
          If you did, it indicates that more output is available. Set this pa-
          rameter  to  the value provided by the previous call's NextToken re-
          sponse to request the next page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the total number of results that you want included on each
          page  of  the response. If you do not include this parameter, it de-
          faults to a value that is specific to the operation.  If  additional
          items  exist  beyond  the number you specify, the NextToken response
          element is returned with a value (not null). Include  the  specified
          value as the NextToken request parameter in the next call to the op-
          eration to get the next part of the results. Note that  the  service
          might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more
          results available. You should check NextToken after every  operation
          to ensure that you receive all of the results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       permissions -> (list)
          An  array  of  objects that describe the permissions associated with
          the resource share.

          (structure)
              Information about an RAM permission.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the permission you want in-
                 formation about.

              version -> (string)
                 The  version  of the permission associated with this resource
                 share.

              defaultVersion -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the version of the managed permission  used
                 by  this  resource share is the default version for this man-
                 aged permission.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of this managed permission.

              resourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to which this permission  applies.  This
                 takes  the  form  of:  service-code  :resource-code  , and is
                 case-insensitive. For example, an Amazon EC2 Subnet would  be
                 represented by the string ec2:subnet .

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the permission.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the permission was created.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the permission was last updated.

              isResourceTypeDefault -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the managed permission associated with this
                 resource share is the default managed permission for all  re-
                 sources of this resource type.

              permissionType -> (string)
                 The  type  of managed permission. This can be one of the fol-
                 lowing values:

                 o AWS_MANAGED  Amazon Web Services created and  manages  this
                   managed permission. You can associate it with your resource
                   shares, but you can't modify it.

                 o CUSTOMER_MANAGED  You, or another principal in your account
                   created  this managed permission. You can associate it with
                   your resource shares and create new versions that have dif-
                   ferent permissions.

              featureSet -> (string)
                 Indicates  what  features  are  available  for  this resource
                 share. This parameter can have one of the following values:

                 o STANDARD  A resource share that supports all functionality.
                   These  resource  shares  are  visible to all principals you
                   share the resource share with. You  can  modify  these  re-
                   source  shares  in  RAM using the console or APIs. This re-
                   source share might have been created by RAM,  or  it  might
                   have been CREATED_FROM_POLICY and then promoted.

                 o CREATED_FROM_POLICY   The  customer  manually  shared a re-
                   source by attaching a resource-based  policy.  That  policy
                   did not match any existing managed permissions, so RAM cre-
                   ated this customer managed permission automatically on  the
                   customer's  behalf  based  on the attached policy document.
                   This type of resource share is visible only to  the  Amazon
                   Web  Services  account that created it. You can't modify it
                   in RAM unless you promote it.  For  more  information,  see
                   PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy .

                 o PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD   This  resource share was originally
                   CREATED_FROM_POLICY , but the customer ran the   PromoteRe-
                   sourceShareCreatedFromPolicy and that operation is still in
                   progress. This value changes to STANDARD when complete.

              tags -> (list)
                 A list of the tag key value pairs currently attached  to  the
                 permission.

                 (structure)
                     A  structure containing a tag. A tag is metadata that you
                     can attach to your resources to help organize and catego-
                     rize  them. You can also use them to help you secure your
                     resources. For more information, see  Controlling  access
                     to Amazon Web Services resources using tags .

                     For  more  information about tags, see Tagging Amazon Web
                     Services resources in the  Amazon  Web  Services  General
                     Reference Guide .

                     key -> (string)
                        The  key, or name, attached to the tag. Every tag must
                        have a key. Key names are case sensitive.

                     value -> (string)
                        The string value attached to the tag. The value can be
                        an empty string. Key values are case sensitive.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  present, this value indicates that more output is available than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request  parameter  in a subsequent call to the operation to get the
          next part of the output. You should repeat this until the  NextToken
          response  element  comes  back as null . This indicates that this is
          the last page of results.
