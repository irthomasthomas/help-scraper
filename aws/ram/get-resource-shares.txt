GET-RESOURCE-SHARES()                                    GET-RESOURCE-SHARES()



NAME
       get-resource-shares -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  details  about  the resource shares that you own or that are
       shared with you.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-resource-shares is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: resourceShares

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --resource-share-status (string)
          Specifies that you want to retrieve details of only  those  resource
          shares that have this status.

            your account

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 129)
            Inline strong start-string without end-string.

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o OTHER-ACCOUNTS

       --name (string)
          Specifies the name of an individual resource share that you want  to
          retrieve details about.

       --tag-filters (list)
          Specifies  that  you want to retrieve details of only those resource
          shares that match the specified tag keys and values.

          (structure)
              A tag key and optional list of possible values that you can  use
              to filter results for tagged resources.

              tagKey -> (string)
                 The tag key. This must have a valid string value and can't be
                 empty.

              tagValues -> (list)
                 A list of zero or more tag values. If no values are provided,
                 then  the  filter matches any tag with the specified key, re-
                 gardless of its value.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          tagKey=string,tagValues=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "tagKey": "string",
              "tagValues": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --permission-arn (string)
          Specifies that you want to retrieve details of only  those  resource
          shares  that  use  the  managed permission with this Amazon Resource
          Name (ARN) .

       --permission-version (integer)
          Specifies that you want to retrieve details for only those  resource
          shares that use the specified version of the managed permission.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 2: To list resource shares owned by others and shared with you

       The following get-resource-shares example  lists  the  resource  shares
       that  others  created  and  shared with you. In this example, there are
       none.

          aws ram get-resource-shares \
              --resource-owner OTHER-ACCOUNTS

       Output:

          {
              "resourceShares": []
          }

OUTPUT
       resourceShares -> (list)
          An array of objects that contain the information about the  resource
          shares.

          (structure)
              Describes a resource share in RAM.

              resourceShareArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource share

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the resource share.

              owningAccountId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the re-
                 source share.

                 Indicates whether principals outside your organization in Or-
                 ganizations can be associated with a resource share.

                 o True   the resource share can be shared with any Amazon Web
                   Services account.

                 o False  the resource share can be shared with only  accounts
                   in  the  same organization as the account that owns the re-

                 (structure)
                     A structure containing a tag. A tag is metadata that  you
                     can attach to your resources to help organize and catego-
                     rize them. You can also use them to help you secure  your
                     resources.  For  more information, see Controlling access
                     to Amazon Web Services resources using tags .

                     For more information about tags, see Tagging  Amazon  Web
                     Services  resources  in  the  Amazon Web Services General
                     Reference Guide .

                     key -> (string)
                        The key, or name, attached to the tag. Every tag  must
                        have a key. Key names are case sensitive.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the resource share was last updated.

              featureSet -> (string)
                 Indicates what  features  are  available  for  this  resource
                 share. This parameter can have one of the following values:

                 o STANDARD  A resource share that supports all functionality.
                   These resource shares are visible  to  all  principals  you
                   share  the  resource  share  with. You can modify these re-
                   source shares in RAM using the console or  APIs.  This  re-
                   source  share  might  have been created by RAM, or it might
                   have been CREATED_FROM_POLICY and then promoted.

                 o CREATED_FROM_POLICY  The customer  manually  shared  a  re-
                   source  by  attaching  a resource-based policy. That policy
                   did not match any existing managed permissions, so RAM cre-
                   ated  this customer managed permission automatically on the
                   customer's behalf based on the  attached  policy  document.
                   This  type  of resource share is visible only to the Amazon
                   Web Services account that created it. You can't  modify  it
                   in  RAM  unless  you  promote it. For more information, see
                   PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy .

                 o PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD  This resource share  was  originally
                   CREATED_FROM_POLICY  , but the customer ran the  PromoteRe-
                   sourceShareCreatedFromPolicy and that operation is still in
                   progress. This value changes to STANDARD when complete.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  present, this value indicates that more output is available than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request  parameter  in a subsequent call to the operation to get the
          next part of the output. You should repeat this until the  NextToken
          response  element  comes  back as null . This indicates that this is
          the last page of results.
