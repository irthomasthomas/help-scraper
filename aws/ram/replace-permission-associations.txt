NAME
       replace-permission-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  all resource shares that use a managed permission to a differ-
       ent managed permission. This operation always applies the default  ver-
       sion  of the target managed permission. You can optionally specify that
       the update applies to only resource shares that currently use a  speci-
       fied version. This enables you to update to the latest version, without
       changing the which managed permission is used.

       You can use this operation to update all of your resource shares to use
       the  current  default  version of the permission by specifying the same
       value for the fromPermissionArn and toPermissionArn parameters.

       You can use the optional fromPermissionVersion parameter to update only
       those  resources that use a specified version of the managed permission
       to the new managed permission.

       WARNING:
          To successfully perform this operation, you must have permission  to
          update the resource-based policy on all affected resource types.

OPTIONS
       --from-permission-arn (string)
          Specifies  the  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the managed permission
          that you want to replace.

       --from-permission-version (integer)
          Specifies that you want to updated the permissions  for  only  those
          resource  shares  that use the specified version of the managed per-
          mission.

       --to-permission-arn (string)
          Specifies the ARN of the managed permission that you want  to  asso-
          ciate  with  resource  shares  in  place  of  the  one  specified by
          fromPerssionArn and fromPermissionVersion .

          The operation always associates the version that  is  currently  the
          default for the specified managed permission.

       --client-token (string)
          Specifies  a  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to
          ensure the idempotency of the request. This lets  you  safely  retry
          the  request  without  accidentally  performing the same operation a
          second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an  operation
          requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters.
          We recommend that you use a UUID type of value. .

          If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services  generates
          a random one for you.

          If you retry the operation with the same ClientToken , but with dif-
          ferent parameters, the retry fails with  an  IdempotentParameterMis-
          match error.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       replacePermissionAssociationsWork -> (structure)
          Specifies a data structure that you can use to track  the  asynchro-
          nous tasks that RAM performs to complete this operation. You can use
          the  ListReplacePermissionAssociationsWork operation and pass the id
          value returned in this structure.

          id -> (string)
              The  unique  identifier  for the background task associated with
              one  ReplacePermissionAssociations request.

          fromPermissionArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  managed  permission  that
              this background task is replacing.

          fromPermissionVersion -> (string)
              The  version of the managed permission that this background task
              is replacing.

          toPermissionArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the managed permission that this background  task  is
              associating  with  the  resource  shares in place of the managed
              permission  and  version  specified  in  fromPermissionArn   and
              fromPermissionVersion .

          toPermissionVersion -> (string)
              The  version of the managed permission that this background task
              is associating with the resource shares. This is always the ver-
              sion that is currently the default for this managed permission.

          status -> (string)
              Specifies  the  current  status  of the background tasks for the
              specified ID. The output is one of the following strings:

              o IN_PROGRESS

              o COMPLETED

              o FAILED

          statusMessage -> (string)
              Specifies the reason for a FAILED status. This field is  present
              only when there status is FAILED .

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and  time  when this asynchronous background task was
              created.

          lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the status of this  background  task  was
              last updated.

       clientToken -> (string)
          The idempotency identifier associated with this request. If you want
          to repeat the same operation in an idempotent manner then  you  must
          include  this  value  in  the  clientToken request parameter of that
          later call. All other parameters must also have the same values that
          you used in the first call.
