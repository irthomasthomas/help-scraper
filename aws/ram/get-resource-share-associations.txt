GET-RESOURCE-SHARE-ASSOCIATIONS()            GET-RESOURCE-SHARE-ASSOCIATIONS()



NAME
       get-resource-share-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the lists of resources and principals that associated for re-
       source shares that you own.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-resource-share-associations is a paginated operation. Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: resourceShareAssociations

OPTIONS
       --association-type (string)
          Specifies whether you want to retrieve the associations that involve
          a specified resource or principal.

          o PRINCIPAL  list the principals whose associations you want to see.

          o RESOURCE  list the resources whose associations you want to see.

          Possible values:

          o PRINCIPAL

          o RESOURCE

       --resource-share-arns (list)
          Specifies a list of Amazon Resource Names  (ARNs)  of  the  resource
          share whose associations you want to retrieve.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --resource-arn (string)
          Specifies  the  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of a resource whose re-
          source shares you want to retrieve.

          You cannot specify this parameter if the association type is PRINCI-
          PAL .

       --principal (string)
          Specifies  the ID of the principal whose resource shares you want to
          retrieve. This can be an Amazon Web Services account ID, an  organi-
          zation  ID,  an  organizational unit ID, or the Amazon Resource Name
          (ARN) of an individual IAM role or user.

          You cannot specify this parameter if the  association  type  is  RE-
          SOURCE .

       --association-status (string)
          Specifies that you want to retrieve only associations that have this
          status.

          Possible values:

          o ASSOCIATING

          o ASSOCIATED

          o FAILED

          o DISASSOCIATING

          o DISASSOCIATED

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To list all resource associations for all resource types

       The following get-resource-share-associations  example  lists  the  re-
       source  associations for all resource types across all of your resource
       shares.

          }

       Example 2: To list principal associations for a resource share

       The following get-resource-share-associations example  lists  only  the
       principal associations for only the specified resource share.

          aws ram get-resource-share-associations \
             --resource-share-arns arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7be8694e-095c-41ca-9ce8-7be4aEXAMPLE \
             --association-type PRINCIPAL

       Output:

          {
              "resourceShareAssociations": [
                  {
                      "resourceShareArn": "arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7be8694e-095c-41ca-9ce8-7be4aEXAMPLE",

                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       resourceShareAssociations -> (list)
          An array of objects that contain the details about the associations.

          (structure)
              Describes  an  association between a resource share and either a
              principal or a resource.

              resourceShareArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource share.

              resourceShareName -> (string)
                 The name of the resource share.

              associatedEntity -> (string)
                 The associated entity. This can be either of the following:

                 o For a resource association, this  is  the  Amazon  Resource
                   Name (ARN) of the resource.

                 o For principal associations, this is one of the following:

                   o The ID of an Amazon Web Services account

                   o The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an organization in Or-
                     ganizations

                   o The ARN of an organizational unit (OU) in Organizations

                   o The ARN of an IAM role

                   o The ARN of an IAM user

              associationType -> (string)
                 The type of entity included in this association.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the association.

              statusMessage -> (string)
                 A message about the status of the association.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the association was created.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the association was last updated.

              external -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the principal belongs to the same organiza-
                 tion in Organizations as the Amazon Web Services account that
                 owns the resource share.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If present, this value indicates that more output is available  than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to  get  the
          next  part of the output. You should repeat this until the NextToken
          response element comes back as null . This indicates  that  this  is
          the last page of results.
