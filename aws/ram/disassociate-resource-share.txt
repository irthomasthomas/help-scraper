OPTIONS
       --resource-share-arn (string)
          Specifies Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource share that  you
          want to remove resources or principals from.

       --resource-arns (list)
          Specifies a list of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for one or more re-
          sources that you want to remove from the resource share.  After  the
          operation runs, these resources are no longer shared with principals
          associated with the resource share.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --principals (list)
          Specifies a list of one or more principals that  no  longer  are  to
          have access to the resources in this resource share.

          You can include the following values:

          o An Amazon Web Services account ID, for example: 123456789012

          o An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an organization in Organizations,
            for  example:  organizations::123456789012:organization/o-example-
            orgid

          o An  ARN of an organizational unit (OU) in Organizations, for exam-
            ple:     organizations::123456789012:ou/o-exampleorgid/ou-example-
            rootid-exampleouid123

          o An  ARN  of an IAM role, for example: iam::123456789012:role/role-
            name

          o An ARN of an IAM user, for example: iam::123456789012user/username

          NOTE:
              Not all resource types can be shared with IAM roles  and  users.
              For  more  information,  see Sharing with IAM roles and users in
              the Resource Access Manager User Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --client-token (string)
          Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that  you  provide  to
          ensure  the  idempotency  of the request. This lets you safely retry
          the request without accidentally performing  the  same  operation  a
          second  time. Passing the same value to a later call to an operation
          requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters.
          We recommend that you use a UUID type of value. .

          If  you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates
          a random one for you.

          If you retry the operation with the same ClientToken , but with dif-
          ferent  parameters,  the retry fails with an IdempotentParameterMis-
          match error.

       --sources (list)
          Specifies from which source accounts the service principal no longer
          has access to the resources in this resource share.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To remove a resource from a resource share

       The following disassociate-resource-share example removes the specified
       resource, in this case a VPC subnet, from the specified resource share.
       Any principals with access to the resource share can no longer  perform
       operations on that resource.

          aws ram disassociate-resource-share \
              --resource-arns arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:subnet/subnet-0250c25a1fEXAMPLE \
              --resource-share-arn arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7ab63972-b505-7e2a-420d-6f5d3EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "resourceShareAssociations": [
                  "resourceShareArn": "arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7ab63972-b505-7e2a-420d-6f5d3EXAMPLE",
                  "associatedEntity": "arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:subnet/subnet-0250c25a1fEXAMPLE",
                  "associationType": "RESOURCE",
                  "status": "DISASSOCIATING",
                  "external": false
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       resourceShareAssociations -> (list)
          An  array of objects with information about the updated associations
          for this resource share.

          (structure)
              Describes an association between a resource share and  either  a
              principal or a resource.

              resourceShareArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource share.

              resourceShareName -> (string)
                 The name of the resource share.

              associatedEntity -> (string)
                 The associated entity. This can be either of the following:

                 o For  a  resource  association,  this is the Amazon Resource
                   Name (ARN) of the resource.

                 o For principal associations, this is one of the following:

                   o The ID of an Amazon Web Services account

                   o The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an organization in  Or-
                     ganizations

                   o The ARN of an organizational unit (OU) in Organizations

                   o The ARN of an IAM role

                   o The ARN of an IAM user

              associationType -> (string)
                 The type of entity included in this association.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the association.

              statusMessage -> (string)
                 A message about the status of the association.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the association was created.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)

              external -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the principal belongs to the same organiza-
                 tion in Organizations as the Amazon Web Services account that
                 owns the resource share.

       clientToken -> (string)
          The idempotency identifier associated with this request. If you want
          to repeat the same operation in an idempotent manner then  you  must
          include  this  value  in  the  clientToken request parameter of that
          later call. All other parameters must also have the same values that
          you used in the first call.
