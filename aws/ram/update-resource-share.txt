OPTIONS
       --resource-share-arn (string)
          Specifies  the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource share that
          you want to modify.

       --name (string)
          If specified, the new name that you want to attach to  the  resource
          share.

       --allow-external-principals | --no-allow-external-principals (boolean)
          Specifies  whether principals outside your organization in Organiza-
          tions can be associated with a resource share.

       --client-token (string)
          Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that  you  provide  to
          ensure  the  idempotency  of the request. This lets you safely retry
          the request without accidentally performing  the  same  operation  a
          second  time. Passing the same value to a later call to an operation
          requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters.
          We recommend that you use a UUID type of value. .

          If  you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates
          a random one for you.

          If you retry the operation with the same ClientToken , but with dif-
          ferent  parameters,  the retry fails with an IdempotentParameterMis-
          match error.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a resource share

       The  following  update-resource-share example changes the specified re-
       source share to allow external principals that are not in an AWS  Orga-
       nization.

          aws ram update-resource-share \
              --allow-external-principals \
              --resource-share-arn arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7ab63972-b505-7e2a-420d-6f5d3EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "resourceShare": {
                  "resourceShareArn": "arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7ab63972-b505-7e2a-420d-6f5d3EXAMPLE",
                  "name": "my-resource-share",
                  "owningAccountId": "123456789012",
                  "allowExternalPrincipals": true,
                  "status": "ACTIVE",
                  "creationTime": 1565295733.282,
                  "lastUpdatedTime": 1565303080.023
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       resourceShare -> (structure)
          Information about the resource share.

          resourceShareArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource share

          name -> (string)
              The name of the resource share.

          owningAccountId -> (string)

              Indicates whether principals outside your organization in  Orga-
              nizations can be associated with a resource share.

              o True   the  resource  share  can be shared with any Amazon Web
                Services account.

              o False  the resource share can be shared with only accounts  in
                the  same  organization  as the account that owns the resource
                share.

              The tag key and value pairs attached to the resource share.

              (structure)
                 A structure containing a tag. A tag is metadata that you  can
                 attach  to  your  resources  to  help organize and categorize
                 them. You can also use them  to  help  you  secure  your  re-
                 sources. For more information, see Controlling access to Ama-
                 zon Web Services resources using tags .

                 For more information about tags, see Tagging Amazon Web  Ser-
                 vices  resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference

                 key -> (string)
                     The key, or name, attached to the  tag.  Every  tag  must
                     have a key. Key names are case sensitive.

                 value -> (string)
                     The string value attached to the tag. The value can be an
                     empty string. Key values are case sensitive.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the resource share was created.

              The date and time when the resource share was last updated.

          featureSet -> (string)
              Indicates what features are available for this  resource  share.
              This parameter can have one of the following values:

              o STANDARD   A  resource  share that supports all functionality.
                These resource shares are visible to all principals you  share
                the  resource share with. You can modify these resource shares
                in RAM using the console or APIs. This  resource  share  might
                have  been  created  by  RAM,  or  it  might  have  been  CRE-
                ATED_FROM_POLICY and then promoted.

              o CREATED_FROM_POLICY  The customer manually shared  a  resource
                by  attaching  a  resource-based  policy.  That policy did not
                match any existing managed permissions, so  RAM  created  this
                customer  managed  permission  automatically on the customer's
                behalf based on the attached policy document. This type of re-
                source  share  is  visible only to the Amazon Web Services ac-
                count that created it. You can't modify it in RAM  unless  you
                promote   it.  For  more  information,  see   PromoteResource-
                ShareCreatedFromPolicy .

              o PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD  This resource share was originally CRE-
                ATED_FROM_POLICY  , but the customer ran the  PromoteResource-
                ShareCreatedFromPolicy  and  that  operation   is   still   in
                progress. This value changes to STANDARD when complete.

       clientToken -> (string)
          The idempotency identifier associated with this request. If you want
          to repeat the same operation in an idempotent manner then  you  must
          include  this  value  in  the  clientToken request parameter of that
          later call. All other parameters must also have the same values that
          you used in the first call.
