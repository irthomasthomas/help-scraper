NAME
       associate-resource-share-permission -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  or  replaces the RAM permission for a resource type included in a
       resource share. You can have exactly  one  permission  associated  with
       each resource type in the resource share. You can add a new RAM permis-
       sion only if there are currently no resources  of  that  resource  type
       currently in the resource share.

OPTIONS
       --resource-share-arn (string)
          Specifies  the  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the resource share to
          which you want to add or replace permissions.

       --permission-arn (string)
          Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  RAM  permission  to
          associate with the resource share. To find the ARN for a permission,
          use either the  ListPermissions operation or go to  the  Permissions
          library page in the RAM console and then choose the name of the per-
          mission. The ARN is displayed on the detail page.

       --replace | --no-replace (boolean)
          Specifies whether the specified permission should replace the exist-
          ing  permission  associated with the resource share. Use true to re-
          place the current permissions. Use false to add the permission to  a
          resource share that currently doesn't have a permission. The default
          value is false .

          NOTE:
              A resource share can have only one permission per resource type.
              If  a  resource share already has a permission for the specified
              resource type and you don't set replace to true then the  opera-
              tion returns an error. This helps prevent accidental overwriting
              of a permission.

       --client-token (string)
          Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that  you  provide  to
          ensure  the  idempotency  of the request. This lets you safely retry
          the request without accidentally performing  the  same  operation  a
          second  time. Passing the same value to a later call to an operation
          requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters.
          We recommend that you use a UUID type of value. .

          If  you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates
          a random one for you.

          If you retry the operation with the same ClientToken , but with dif-
          ferent  parameters,  the retry fails with an IdempotentParameterMis-
          match error.

       --permission-version (integer)
          Specifies the version of the RAM permission to  associate  with  the
          resource  share.  You can specify only the version that is currently
          set as the default version for the permission. If you also  set  the
          replace  pararameter  to  true , then this operation updates an out-
          dated version of the permission to the current default version.

          NOTE:
              You don't need to specify this parameter because the default be-
              havior  is  to  use the version that is currently set as the de-
              fault version for the permission. This  parameter  is  supported
              for backwards compatibility.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To associate a RAM managed permission with a resource share

       The  following associate-resource-share-permission example replaces the
       existing managed permission for the relevant  resource  type  with  the
       specified  managed  permission. Access to all resources of the relevant
       resource type is governed by the new permission.

          aws ram associate-resource-share-permission \
              --permission-arn arn:aws:ram::aws:permission/AWSRAMPermissionGlueDatabaseReadWrite \
              --replace \
              --resource-share-arn arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/27d09b4b-5e12-41d1-a4f2-19dedEXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "returnValue": true
          }

OUTPUT
       returnValue -> (boolean)
          A return value of true indicates that the request succeeded. A value
          of false indicates that the request failed.

       clientToken -> (string)
          The idempotency identifier associated with this request. If you want
          to repeat the same operation in an idempotent manner then  you  must
          include  this  value  in  the  clientToken request parameter of that
          later call. All other parameters must also have the same values that
          you used in the first call.
