DELETE-PERMISSION-VERSION()                        DELETE-PERMISSION-VERSION()



NAME
       delete-permission-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  one  version of a customer managed permission. The version you
       specify must not be attached to any resource share and must not be  the
       default version for the permission.

       If  a  customer  managed permission has the maximum of 5 versions, then
       you must delete at least one version before you can create another.

OPTIONS
       --permission-arn (string)
          Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the permission with  the
          version you want to delete.

       --permission-version (integer)
          Specifies the version number to delete.

          You  can't delete the default version for a customer managed permis-
          sion.

          You can't delete a version if it's the only version of  the  permis-
          sion.  You  must  either first create another version, or delete the
          permission completely.

          You can't delete a version if it is attached to any resource shares.
          If the version is the default, you must first use  SetDefaultPermis-
          sionVersion to set a different version as the default for  the  cus-
          tomer  managed  permission, and then use  AssociateResourceSharePer-
          mission to update your resource shares to use the new  default  ver-
          sion.

       --client-token (string)
          Specifies  a  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to
          ensure the idempotency of the request. This lets  you  safely  retry
          the  request  without  accidentally  performing the same operation a
          second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an  operation
          requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters.
          We recommend that you use a UUID type of value. .

          If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services  generates
          a random one for you.

          If you retry the operation with the same ClientToken , but with dif-
          ferent parameters, the retry fails with  an  IdempotentParameterMis-
          match error.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       returnValue -> (boolean)
          A boolean value that indicates whether the operation is successful.

       clientToken -> (string)
          The idempotency identifier associated with this request. If you want
          to repeat the same operation in an idempotent manner then  you  must
          include  this  value  in  the  clientToken request parameter of that
          later call. All other parameters must also have the same values that
          you used in the first call.

       permissionStatus -> (string)
          This operation is performed asynchronously, and this response param-
          eter indicates the current status.
