NAME
       list-pending-invitation-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the resources in a resource share that is shared with you but for
       which the invitation is still PENDING . That means that you haven't ac-
       cepted or rejected the invitation and the invitation hasn't expired.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

OPTIONS
       --resource-share-invitation-arn (string)
          Specifies  the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the invitation. You can
          use  GetResourceShareInvitations to find the ARN of the invitation.

       --next-token (string)
          Specifies that you want to receive the next page of  results.  Valid
          only  if  you received a NextToken response in the previous request.
          If you did, it indicates that more output is available. Set this pa-
          rameter  to  the value provided by the previous call's NextToken re-
          sponse to request the next page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the total number of results that you want included on each
          page  of  the response. If you do not include this parameter, it de-
          faults to a value that is specific to the operation.  If  additional
          items  exist  beyond  the number you specify, the NextToken response
          element is returned with a value (not null). Include  the  specified
          value as the NextToken request parameter in the next call to the op-
          eration to get the next part of the results. Note that  the  service
          might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more
          results available. You should check NextToken after every  operation
          to ensure that you receive all of the results.

       --resource-region-scope (string)
          Specifies  that  you want the results to include only resources that
          have the specified scope.

          o ALL  the results include both global and regional resources or re-
            source types.

          o GLOBAL   the  results  include  only  global resources or resource
            types.

          o REGIONAL  the results include only regional resources or  resource
            types.

          The default value is ALL .

          Possible values:

          o ALL

          o REGIONAL

          o GLOBAL

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following list-pending-invitation-resources example  lists  all  of
       the resources that are in the resource share associated with the speci-
       fied invitation.

OUTPUT
       resources -> (list)
          An array of objects that contain the information about the resources
          included the specified resource share.

          (structure)
              Describes a resource associated with a resource share in RAM.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource.

              type -> (string)
                 The  resource type. This takes the form of: service-code :re-
                 source-code , and is case-insensitive. For example, an Amazon
                 EC2 Subnet would be represented by the string ec2:subnet .

              resourceShareArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource share this re-
                 source is associated with.

              resourceGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  resource  group.  This
                 value is available only if the resource is part of a resource
                 group.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the resource.

              statusMessage -> (string)
                 A message about the status of the resource.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the resource was associated  with  the
                 resource share.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  an  time when the association between the resource
                 and the resource share was last updated.

              resourceRegionScope -> (string)
                 Specifies the scope of visibility of this resource:

                 o REGIONAL  The resource can be accessed only  by  using  re-
                   quests  that target the Amazon Web Services Region in which
                   the resource exists.

                 o GLOBAL  The resource can be accessed from  any  Amazon  Web
                   Services Region.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  present, this value indicates that more output is available than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request  parameter  in a subsequent call to the operation to get the
          next part of the output. You should repeat this until the  NextToken
          response  element  comes  back as null . This indicates that this is
          the last page of results.
