OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Specifies the name of the customer managed permission. The name must
          be unique within the Amazon Web Services Region.

       --resource-type (string)
          Specifies the name of the resource type that this  customer  managed
          permission applies to.

          The  format is `` <service-code> :<resource-type> `` and is not case
          sensitive. For example, to specify an Amazon EC2 Subnet, you can use
          the string ec2:subnet . To see the list of valid values for this pa-
          rameter, query the  ListResourceTypes operation.

       --policy-template (string)
          A string in JSON format string that contains the following  elements
          of a resource-based policy:

          o Effect : must be set to ALLOW .

          o Action  :  specifies the actions that are allowed by this customer
            managed permission. The list must contain only  actions  that  are
            supported  by  the  specified resource type. For a list of all ac-
            tions supported by each resource type, see Actions, resources, and
            condition  keys  for  Amazon Web Services services in the Identity
            and Access Management User Guide .

          o Condition : (optional) specifies conditional parameters that  must
            evaluate to true when a user attempts an action for that action to
            be allowed. For more information about the Condition element,  see
            IAM policies: Condition element in the Identity and Access Manage-
            ment User Guide .

          This template can't include either the Resource  or  Principal  ele-
          ments.  Those are both filled in by RAM when it instantiates the re-
          source-based policy on each resource shared using this managed  per-
          mission.  The  Resource  comes from the ARN of the specific resource
          that you are sharing. The Principal comes from the list  of  identi-
          ties added to the resource share.

       --client-token (string)
          Specifies  a  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to
          ensure the idempotency of the request. This lets  you  safely  retry
          the  request  without  accidentally  performing the same operation a
          second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an  operation
          requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters.
          We recommend that you use a UUID type of value. .

          If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services  generates
          a random one for you.

          If you retry the operation with the same ClientToken , but with dif-
          ferent parameters, the retry fails with  an  IdempotentParameterMis-
          match error.

       --tags (list)
          Specifies a list of one or more tag key and value pairs to attach to
          the permission.

          (structure)
              A structure containing a tag. A tag is metadata that you can at-
              tach to your resources to help organize and categorize them. You
              can also use them to help you secure your  resources.  For  more
              information,  see  Controlling access to Amazon Web Services re-
              sources using tags .

              For more information about tags, see Tagging Amazon Web Services
              resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference Guide .

              key -> (string)
                 The  key, or name, attached to the tag. Every tag must have a
                 key. Key names are case sensitive.

              value -> (string)
                 The string value attached to the tag. The  value  can  be  an
                 empty string. Key values are case sensitive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       permission -> (structure)
          A structure with information about this customer managed permission.

          arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the permission you want infor-
              mation about.

          version -> (string)
              The  version  of  the  permission  associated with this resource
              share.

          defaultVersion -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the version of the managed permission used  by
              this resource share is the default version for this managed per-
              mission.

          name -> (string)
              The name of this managed permission.

          resourceType -> (string)
              The type of resource to  which  this  permission  applies.  This
              takes the form of: service-code :resource-code , and is case-in-
              sensitive. For example, an Amazon EC2  Subnet  would  be  repre-
              sented by the string ec2:subnet .

          status -> (string)
              The current status of the permission.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the permission was created.

          lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the permission was last updated.

          isResourceTypeDefault -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  the  managed permission associated with this
              resource share is the default managed  permission  for  all  re-
              sources of this resource type.

          permissionType -> (string)
              The type of managed permission. This can be one of the following
              values:

              o AWS_MANAGED  Amazon Web Services created and manages this man-
                aged  permission.  You  can  associate  it  with your resource
                shares, but you can't modify it.

              o CUSTOMER_MANAGED  You, or another principal  in  your  account
                created  this  managed  permission.  You can associate it with
                your resource shares and create new versions that have differ-
                ent permissions.

          featureSet -> (string)
              Indicates  what  features are available for this resource share.
              This parameter can have one of the following values:

              o STANDARD  A resource share that  supports  all  functionality.
                These  resource shares are visible to all principals you share
                the resource share with. You can modify these resource  shares
                in  RAM  using  the console or APIs. This resource share might
                have  been  created  by  RAM,  or  it  might  have  been  CRE-
                ATED_FROM_POLICY and then promoted.

              o CREATED_FROM_POLICY   The  customer manually shared a resource
                by attaching a resource-based  policy.  That  policy  did  not
                match  any  existing  managed permissions, so RAM created this
                customer managed permission automatically  on  the  customer's
                behalf based on the attached policy document. This type of re-
                source share is visible only to the Amazon  Web  Services  ac-
                count  that  created it. You can't modify it in RAM unless you
                promote  it.  For  more  information,  see    PromoteResource-
                ShareCreatedFromPolicy .

              o PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD  This resource share was originally CRE-
                ATED_FROM_POLICY , but the customer ran the   PromoteResource-
                ShareCreatedFromPolicy   and   that   operation  is  still  in
                progress. This value changes to STANDARD when complete.

          tags -> (list)
              A list of the tag key value pairs currently attached to the per-
              mission.

              (structure)
                 A  structure containing a tag. A tag is metadata that you can
                 attach to your resources  to  help  organize  and  categorize
                 them.  You  can  also  use  them  to help you secure your re-
                 sources. For more information, see Controlling access to Ama-
                 zon Web Services resources using tags .

                 For  more information about tags, see Tagging Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices resources in the Amazon Web Services General  Reference
                 Guide .

                 key -> (string)
                     The  key,  or  name,  attached to the tag. Every tag must
                     have a key. Key names are case sensitive.

                 value -> (string)
                     The string value attached to the tag. The value can be an
                     empty string. Key values are case sensitive.

       clientToken -> (string)
          The idempotency identifier associated with this request. If you want
          to repeat the same operation in an idempotent manner then  you  must
          include  this  value  in  the  clientToken request parameter of that
          later call. All other parameters must also have the same values that
          you used in the first call.
