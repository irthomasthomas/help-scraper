OPTIONS
       --permission-arn (string)
          Specifies  the  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the permission whose
          contents you want to retrieve. To find the ARN for a permission, use
          either  the   ListPermissions operation or go to the Permissions li-
          brary page in the RAM console and then choose the name of  the  per-
          mission. The ARN is displayed on the detail page.

       --permission-version (integer)
          Specifies  the  version number of the RAM permission to retrieve. If
          you don't specify this parameter, the operation  retrieves  the  de-
          fault version.

          To see the list of available versions, use  ListPermissionVersions .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve the details for a RAM managed permission

       The following get-permission example displays the details for  the  de-
       fault version of the specified RAM managed permission.

          aws ram get-permission \
              --permission-arn arn:aws:ram::aws:permission/AWSRAMPermissionGlueTableReadWriteForDatabase

       Output:

              The actions list  the  operations  to  which  the  principal  is
              granted or denied access.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the permission was created.

          lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the permission was last updated.

          isResourceTypeDefault -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  the version of the permission represented in
              this response is the default version for all resources  of  this
              resource type.

          permissionType -> (string)
              The type of managed permission. This can be one of the following
              values:

              o AWS_MANAGED  Amazon Web Services created and manages this man-
                aged  permission.  You  can  associate  it  with your resource
                shares, but you can't modify it.

              o CUSTOMER_MANAGED  You, or another principal  in  your  account
                created  this  managed  permission.  You can associate it with
                your resource shares and create new versions that have differ-
                ent permissions.

          featureSet -> (string)
              Indicates  what  features are available for this resource share.
              This parameter can have one of the following values:

              o STANDARD  A resource share that  supports  all  functionality.
                These  resource shares are visible to all principals you share
                the resource share with. You can modify these resource  shares
                in  RAM  using  the console or APIs. This resource share might
                have  been  created  by  RAM,  or  it  might  have  been  CRE-
                ATED_FROM_POLICY and then promoted.

              o CREATED_FROM_POLICY   The  customer manually shared a resource
                by attaching a resource-based  policy.  That  policy  did  not
                match  any  existing  managed permissions, so RAM created this
                customer managed permission automatically  on  the  customer's
                behalf based on the attached policy document. This type of re-
                source share is visible only to the Amazon  Web  Services  ac-
                count  that  created it. You can't modify it in RAM unless you
                promote  it.  For  more  information,  see    PromoteResource-
                ShareCreatedFromPolicy .

              o PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD  This resource share was originally CRE-
                ATED_FROM_POLICY , but the customer ran the   PromoteResource-
                ShareCreatedFromPolicy   and   that   operation  is  still  in
                progress. This value changes to STANDARD when complete.

          status -> (string)
              The current status of the association between the permission and
              the resource share. The following are the possible values:

              o ATTACHABLE   This permission or version can be associated with
                resource shares.

              o UNATTACHABLE  This permission or version  can't  currently  be
                associated with resource shares.

              o DELETING   This permission or version is in the process of be-
                ing deleted.

              o DELETED  This permission or version is deleted.

          tags -> (list)
              The tag key and value pairs attached to the resource share.

              (structure)
                 A structure containing a tag. A tag is metadata that you  can
                 attach  to  your  resources  to  help organize and categorize
                 them. You can also use them  to  help  you  secure  your  re-
                 sources. For more information, see Controlling access to Ama-
                 zon Web Services resources using tags .

                 For more information about tags, see Tagging Amazon Web  Ser-
                 vices  resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference
                 Guide .

                 key -> (string)
                     The key, or name, attached to the  tag.  Every  tag  must
                     have a key. Key names are case sensitive.

                 value -> (string)
                     The string value attached to the tag. The value can be an
                     empty string. Key values are case sensitive.
