CREATE-RESOURCE-SHARE()                                CREATE-RESOURCE-SHARE()



NAME
       create-resource-share -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a resource share. You can provide a list of the Amazon Resource
       Names (ARNs) for the resources that you want to share, a list of  prin-
       cipals  you  want  to  share the resources with, and the permissions to
       grant those principals.

       NOTE:
          Sharing a resource makes it available for use by principals  outside
          of  the Amazon Web Services account that created the resource. Shar-
          ing doesn't change any permissions or quotas that apply to  the  re-
          source in the account that created it.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Specifies the name of the resource share.

       --resource-arns (list)
          Specifies  a  list of one or more ARNs of the resources to associate
          with the resource share.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --principals (list)
          Specifies a list of one or more principals to associate with the re-
          source share.

          You can include the following values:

          o An Amazon Web Services account ID, for example: 123456789012

          o An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an organization in Organizations,
            for  example:  organizations::123456789012:organization/o-example-
            orgid

          o An  ARN of an organizational unit (OU) in Organizations, for exam-
            ple:     organizations::123456789012:ou/o-exampleorgid/ou-example-
            rootid-exampleouid123

          o An  ARN  of an IAM role, for example: iam::123456789012:role/role-
            name

          o An ARN of an IAM user, for example: iam::123456789012user/username

          NOTE:
              Not all resource types can be shared with IAM roles  and  users.
              For  more  information,  see Sharing with IAM roles and users in
              the Resource Access Manager User Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          Specifies one or more tags to attach to the resource  share  itself.
          It  doesn't attach the tags to the resources associated with the re-
          source share.

          (structure)
              A structure containing a tag. A tag is metadata that you can at-
              tach to your resources to help organize and categorize them. You
              can also use them to help you secure your  resources.  For  more
              information,  see  Controlling access to Amazon Web Services re-
              sources using tags .

              For more information about tags, see Tagging Amazon Web Services
              resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference Guide .

              key -> (string)
                 The  key, or name, attached to the tag. Every tag must have a
                 key. Key names are case sensitive.

              value -> (string)
                 The string value attached to the tag. The  value  can  be  an
                 empty string. Key values are case sensitive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --allow-external-principals | --no-allow-external-principals (boolean)
          Specifies  whether principals outside your organization in Organiza-
          tions can be associated with a resource share. A value of true  lets
          you  share with individual Amazon Web Services accounts that are not
          in your organization. A value of false only has meaning if your  ac-
          count  is  a  member of an Amazon Web Services Organization. The de-
          fault value is true .

       --client-token (string)
          Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that  you  provide  to
          ensure  the  idempotency  of the request. This lets you safely retry
          the request without accidentally performing  the  same  operation  a
          second  time. Passing the same value to a later call to an operation
          requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters.
          We recommend that you use a UUID type of value. .

          If  you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates
          a random one for you.

          If you retry the operation with the same ClientToken , but with dif-
          ferent  parameters,  the retry fails with an IdempotentParameterMis-
          match error.

       --permission-arns (list)
          Specifies the Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the RAM permission  to
          associate  with the resource share. If you do not specify an ARN for
          the permission, RAM automatically attaches the  default  version  of
          the  permission  for  each resource type. You can associate only one
          permission with each resource type included in the resource share.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create a resource share

       The following create-resource-share example creates an  empty  resource
       share with the specified name. You must separately add resources, prin-
       cipals, and permissions to the share.

          aws ram create-resource-share \
              --name MyNewResourceShare

       Output:

          {
              "resourceShare": {
                  "resourceShareArn": "arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/4476c27d-8feb-4b21-afe9-7de23EXAMPLE",
                  "name": "MyNewResourceShare",
                  "owningAccountId": "123456789012",
                  "allowExternalPrincipals": true,
                  "status": "ACTIVE",
                  "creationTime": 1634586271.302,
                  "lastUpdatedTime": 1634586271.302
              }
          }

       Example 2: To create a resource share with AWS accounts as principals

       The following create-resource-share example creates  a  resource  share
       and  grants  access to the specified AWS account (222222222222). If the
       specified principals are not part of the same  AWS  Organization,  then
       invitations are sent and must be accepted before access is granted.

          aws ram create-resource-share \
              --name MyNewResourceShare \
              --principals 222222222222

       Example  3: To create a resource share restricted to your AWS Organiza-
       tion

       The following create-resource-share example creates  a  resource  share
       that  is  restricted  to accounts in the AWS Organization that your ac-
       count is a member of, and adds the specified OU as a principal. All ac-
       counts in that OU can use the resources in the resource share.

          aws ram create-resource-share \
              --name MyNewResourceShare \
              --no-allow-external-principals \
              --principals arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:ou/o-63bEXAMPLE/ou-46xi-rEXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "resourceShare": {
                  "resourceShareArn": "arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7be8694e-095c-41ca-9ce8-7be4aEXAMPLE",
                  "name": "MyNewResourceShare",
                  "owningAccountId": "123456789012",
                  "allowExternalPrincipals": false,
                  "status": "ACTIVE",
                  "creationTime": 1634587042.49,
                  "lastUpdatedTime": 1634587042.49
              }
          }

          tags -> (list)
              The tag key and value pairs attached to the resource share.

              (structure)
                 A structure containing a tag. A tag is metadata that you  can
                 attach  to  your  resources  to  help organize and categorize
                 them. You can also use them  to  help  you  secure  your  re-
                 sources. For more information, see Controlling access to Ama-
                 zon Web Services resources using tags .

                 For more information about tags, see Tagging Amazon Web  Ser-
                 vices  resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference
                 Guide .

                 key -> (string)
                     The key, or name, attached to the  tag.  Every  tag  must
                     have a key. Key names are case sensitive.

                 value -> (string)
                     The string value attached to the tag. The value can be an
                     empty string. Key values are case sensitive.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the resource share was created.

          lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the resource share was last updated.

          featureSet -> (string)
              Indicates what features are available for this  resource  share.
              This parameter can have one of the following values:

              o STANDARD   A  resource  share that supports all functionality.
                These resource shares are visible to all principals you  share
                the  resource share with. You can modify these resource shares
                in RAM using the console or APIs. This  resource  share  might
                have  been  created  by  RAM,  or  it  might  have  been  CRE-
                ATED_FROM_POLICY and then promoted.

              o CREATED_FROM_POLICY  The customer manually shared  a  resource
                by  attaching  a  resource-based  policy.  That policy did not
                match any existing managed permissions, so  RAM  created  this
                customer  managed  permission  automatically on the customer's
                behalf based on the attached policy document. This type of re-
                source  share  is  visible only to the Amazon Web Services ac-
                count that created it. You can't modify it in RAM  unless  you
                promote   it.  For  more  information,  see   PromoteResource-
                ShareCreatedFromPolicy .

              o PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD  This resource share was originally CRE-
                ATED_FROM_POLICY  , but the customer ran the  PromoteResource-
                ShareCreatedFromPolicy  and  that  operation   is   still   in
                progress. This value changes to STANDARD when complete.

       clientToken -> (string)
          The idempotency identifier associated with this request. If you want
          to repeat the same operation in an idempotent manner then  you  must
          include  this  value  in  the  clientToken request parameter of that
          later call. All other parameters must also have the same values that
          you used in the first call.
