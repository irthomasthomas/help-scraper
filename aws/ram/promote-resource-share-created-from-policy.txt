PROMOTE-RESOURCE-SHARE-CREATED-FROPROMOTE-RESOURCE-SHARE-CREATED-FROM-POLICY()



NAME
       promote-resource-share-created-from-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       When  you  attach  a resource-based policy to a resource, RAM automati-
       cally creates a resource share of  featureSet  =``CREATED_FROM_POLICY``
       with  a  managed  permission  that  has the same IAM permissions as the
       original resource-based policy. However, this type of  managed  permis-
       sion  is  visible  to only the resource share owner, and the associated
       resource share can't be modified by using RAM.

       This operation promotes the resource share to a STANDARD resource share
       that is fully manageable in RAM. When you promote a resource share, you
       can then manage the resource share in RAM and it becomes visible to all
       of the principals you shared it with.

       WARNING:
          Before you perform this operation, you should first run  PromotePer-
          missionCreatedFromPolicy to ensure that you have an appropriate cus-
          tomer  managed  permission that can be associated with this resource
          share after its is promoted. If this operation can't find a  managed
          permission  that  exactly  matches  the existing CREATED_FROM_POLICY
          permission, then this operation fails.

OPTIONS
       --resource-share-arn (string)
          Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  resource  share  to
          promote.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To promote a resource-policy based resource share to full functionality
       in AWS RAM

       The following promote-resource-share-created-from-policy example  takes
       a  resource  share  that  you  created  implicitly  by  attaching a re-
       source-based policy, and converts it to be fully  functional  with  the
       AWS RAM console and its CLI and API operations.

          aws ram promote-resource-share-created-from-policy \
              --resource-share-arn arn:aws:ram:us-east-1:123456789012:resource-share/91fa8429-2d06-4032-909a-90909EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "returnValue": true
          }

OUTPUT
       returnValue -> (boolean)
          A return value of true indicates that the request succeeded. A value
          of false indicates that the request failed.
