PROMOTE-RESOURCE-SHARE-CREATED-FROPROMOTE-RESOURCE-SHARE-CREATED-FROM-POLICY()



NAME
       promote-resource-share-created-from-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       When  you  attach  a resource-based permission policy to a resource, it
       automatically creates a resource share. However, resource  shares  cre-
       ated this way are visible only to the resource share owner, and the re-
       source share can't be modified in RAM.

       You can use this operation to promote the resource share to a full  RAM
       resource  share. When you promote a resource share, you can then manage
       the resource share in RAM and it becomes visible to all of the  princi-
       pals you shared it with.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            promote-resource-share-created-from-policy
          --resource-share-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-share-arn (string)
          Specifies  the  Amazon  Resoure  Name (ARN) of the resource share to
          promote.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To promote a resource-policy based resource share to full functionality
       in AWS RAM

       The  following promote-resource-share-created-from-policy example takes
       a resource share  that  you  created  implicitly  by  attaching  a  re-
       source-based  policy,  and  converts it to be fully functional with the
       AWS RAM console and its CLI and API operations.

          aws ram promote-resource-share-created-from-policy \
              --resource-share-arn arn:aws:ram:us-east-1:123456789012:resource-share/91fa8429-2d06-4032-909a-90909EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "returnValue": true
          }

OUTPUT
       returnValue -> (boolean)
          A return value of true indicates that the request succeeded. A value
          of false indicates that the request failed.
