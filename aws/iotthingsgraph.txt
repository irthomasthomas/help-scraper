       iotthingsgraph -

DESCRIPTION
       AWS  IoT  Things  Graph provides an integrated set of tools that enable
       developers to connect devices and services  that  use  different  stan-
       dards,  such  as  units of measure and communication protocols. AWS IoT
       Things Graph makes it possible to build IoT applications with little to
       no code by connecting devices and services and defining how they inter-
       act at an abstract level.

       For more information about how AWS IoT Things Graph works, see the User
       Guide .

       The AWS IoT Things Graph service is discontinued.
