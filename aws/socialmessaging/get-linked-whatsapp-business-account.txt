OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The unique identifier, from Amazon Web Services, of the linked What-
          sApp  Business  Account.   WABA   identifiers   are   formatted   as
          waba-01234567890123456789012345678901              .             Use
          ListLinkedWhatsAppBusinessAccounts to list all WABAs and  their  de-
          tails.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
