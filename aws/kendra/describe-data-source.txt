DESCRIBE-DATA-SOURCE()                                  DESCRIBE-DATA-SOURCE()



NAME
       describe-data-source -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about an Amazon Kendra data source connector.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-data-source  uses  document type values. Document types follow
       the JSON data model where valid values are: strings, numbers, booleans,
       null, arrays, and objects. For command input, options and nested param-
       eters that are labeled with the type document must be provided as JSON.
       Shorthand syntax does not support document types.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-data-source
          --id <value>
          --index-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The identifier of the data source connector.

       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index used with the data source connector.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Id -> (string)
          The identifier of the data source connector.

       IndexId -> (string)
          The identifier of the index used with the data source connector.

       Name -> (string)
          The name for the data source connector.

       Type -> (string)
          The type of the data source. For example, SHAREPOINT .

       Configuration -> (structure)
          Configuration details for the data source connector. This shows  how
          the  data source is configured. The configuration options for a data
          source depend on the data source provider.

          S3Configuration -> (structure)
              Provides the configuration information to connect to  an  Amazon
              S3 bucket as your data source.

              NOTE:
                 Amazon Kendra now supports an upgraded Amazon S3 connector.

                 You  must now use the TemplateConfiguration object instead of
                 the S3DataSourceConfiguration object to configure  your  con-
                 nector.

                 Connectors  configured using the older console and API archi-
                 tecture will continue to function as configured. However, you
                 won't  be able to edit or update them. If you want to edit or
                 update your connector configuration, you must  create  a  new
                 connector.

                 We  recommended  migrating your connector workflow to the up-
                 graded version. Support for connectors configured  using  the
                 older architecture is scheduled to end by June 2024.

              BucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the bucket that contains the documents.

              InclusionPrefixes -> (list)
                 A  list  of  S3 prefixes for the documents that should be in-
                 cluded in the index.

                 (string)

              InclusionPatterns -> (list)
                 A list of glob patterns (patterns that can expand a  wildcard
                 pattern  into  a list of path names that match the given pat-
                 tern) for certain file names and file  types  to  include  in
                 your  index.  If a document matches both an inclusion and ex-
                 clusion prefix or pattern, the exclusion prefix takes precen-
                 dence  and the document is not indexed. Examples of glob pat-
                 terns include:

                 tern)  for  certain file names and file types to exclude from
                 your index. If a document matches both an inclusion  and  ex-
                 clusion prefix or pattern, the exclusion prefix takes precen-
                 dence and the document is not indexed. Examples of glob  pat-

                 document access control information, source URI, document au-
                 thor, and custom  attributes.  Each  metadata  file  contains
                 metadata about a single document.

                 S3Prefix -> (string)
                     A  prefix  used to filter metadata configuration files in
                     the Amazon Web Services S3 bucket. The  S3  bucket  might
                     contain  multiple metadata files. Use S3Prefix to include
                     only the desired metadata files.

              AccessControlListConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Provides the path to the S3 bucket  that  contains  the  user
                 context  filtering  files for the data source. For the format
                 of the file, see Access control for S3 data sources .

                 KeyPath -> (string)
                     Path to the Amazon S3 bucket that contains the ACL files.

              SecretArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Secrets  Manager  secret
                 that  contains the user name and password required to connect
                 to  the  SharePoint  instance.  For  more  information,   see
                 Microsoft SharePoint .

              CrawlAttachments -> (boolean)
                 TRUE to index document attachments.

              UseChangeLog -> (boolean)
                 TRUE to use the SharePoint change log to determine which doc-
                 uments require updating in the index. Depending on the change
                 log's  size,  it may take longer for Amazon Kendra to use the
                 change log than to scan all of your documents in SharePoint.

              InclusionPatterns -> (list)
                 A list of regular expression patterns to include certain doc-
                 uments  in your SharePoint. Documents that match the patterns
                 are included in the index. Documents  that  don't  match  the
                 patterns  are  excluded from the index. If a document matches
                 both an inclusion and exclusion pattern, the  exclusion  pat-
                 tern  takes precedence and the document isn't included in the
                 index.

                 The regex applies to the display URL of the SharePoint  docu-
                 ment.

                 (string)

              ExclusionPatterns -> (list)
                 A list of regular expression patterns to exclude certain doc-
                 uments in your SharePoint. Documents that match the  patterns
                 are  excluded  from the index. Documents that don't match the
                 patterns are included in the index.  If  a  document  matches
                 both  an  inclusion and exclusion pattern, the exclusion pat-
                 tern takes precedence and the document isn't included in  the
                 index.

                 The  regex applies to the display URL of the SharePoint docu-
                 ment.

                 SubnetIds -> (list)
                     A list of identifiers for subnets within your Amazon VPC.
                     The  subnets  should  be able to connect to each other in
                     the VPC, and they should have outgoing access to the  In-
                     ternet through a NAT device.

                     (string)

                 SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                     A list of identifiers of security groups within your Ama-
                     zon VPC. The security groups should enable Amazon  Kendra
                     to connect to the data source.

                     (string)

              FieldMappings -> (list)
                 A  list  of  DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping  objects  that map
                 SharePoint data source attributes or field  names  to  Amazon
                 Kendra  index  field  names. To create custom fields, use the
                 UpdateIndex API before you map to SharePoint fields. For more
                 information,  see Mapping data source fields . The SharePoint
                 data source field names must exist in your SharePoint  custom
                 metadata.

                 (structure)
                     Maps  attributes  or  field names of the documents synced
                     from the data source to Amazon Kendra index field  names.
                     You  can  set up field mappings for each data source when
                     calling CreateDataSource or UpdateDataSource API. To cre-
                     ate  custom fields, use the UpdateIndex API to first cre-
                     ate an index field and then map to the data source field.
                     For more information, see Mapping data source fields .

                     DataSourceFieldName -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the  field in the data source. You must
                        first create the index  field  using  the  UpdateIndex
                        API.

                     DateFieldFormat -> (string)
                        The  format for date fields in the data source. If the
                        field  specified  in  DataSourceFieldName  is  a  date
                        field,  you must specify the date format. If the field
                        is not a date field, an exception is thrown.

                     IndexFieldName -> (string)
                        The name of the index field to map to the data  source
                        field. The index field type must match the data source
                        field type.

              DocumentTitleFieldName -> (string)
                 The Microsoft SharePoint attribute field  that  contains  the
                 title of the document.

                 TRUE to disable local groups information.

              SslCertificateS3Path -> (structure)
                 The  path  to  the  SSL  certificate  stored  in an Amazon S3
                 bucket. You use this to connect to SharePoint Server  if  you
                 require a secure SSL connection.

                 You  can  generate a self-signed X509 certificate on any com-
                 puter using OpenSSL. For an example of using OpenSSL to  cre-
                 ate an X509 certificate, see Create and sign an X509 certifi-
                 cate .

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     The name of the S3 bucket that contains the file.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name of the file.

              AuthenticationType -> (string)
                 Whether you want to connect to SharePoint Online using  basic
                 authentication  of user name and password, or OAuth authenti-
                 cation of user name, password, client ID, and client  secret,
                 or AD App-only authentication of client secret.

              ProxyConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Configuration information to connect to your Microsoft Share-
                 Point site URLs via instance via a web  proxy.  You  can  use
                 this option for SharePoint Server.

                 You  must  provide the website host name and port number. For
                 example, the host name of https://a.example.com/page1.html is
                 "a.example.com"  and  the  port is 443, the standard port for
                 HTTPS.

                 Web proxy credentials are optional and you can  use  them  to
                 connect to a web proxy server that requires basic authentica-
                 tion of user name and password. To store  web  proxy  creden-
                 tials, you use a secret in Secrets Manager.

                 It  is  recommended  that  you follow best security practices
                 when configuring your web proxy.  This  includes  setting  up
                 throttling,  setting  up logging and monitoring, and applying
                 security patches on a regular basis.  If  you  use  your  web
                 proxy with multiple data sources, sync jobs that occur at the
                 same time could strain the load on your proxy. It  is  recom-
                 mended you prepare your proxy beforehand for any security and
                 load requirements.

                 Host -> (string)
                     The name of the website host you want to connect to via a
                     web proxy server.

                     For       example,       the       host      name      of
                     https://a.example.com/page1.html is "a.example.com".

                 Port -> (integer)
                     The port number of the website host you want  to  connect
                     to via a web proxy server.

                     For         example,         the         port         for
                     https://a.example.com/page1.html  is  443,  the  standard
                     port for HTTPS.

                 Credentials -> (string)
                     Your secret ARN, which you can create in Secrets Manager

                     The  credentials  are  optional.  You use a secret if web
                     proxy credentials are required to connect  to  a  website
                     host.  Amazon  Kendra currently support basic authentica-
                     tion to connect to a web proxy server. The secret  stores
                     your credentials.

                     (structure)
                        Maps attributes or field names of the documents synced
                        from the data source  to  Amazon  Kendra  index  field
                        names.  You  can  set  up field mappings for each data
                        source    when     calling     CreateDataSource     or
                        UpdateDataSource API. To create custom fields, use the
                        UpdateIndex API to first create  an  index  field  and
                        then  map  to the data source field. For more informa-
                        tion, see Mapping data source fields .

                        DataSourceFieldName -> (string)
                            The name of the field in the data source. You must

                            The format for date fields in the data source.  If
                            the  field  specified  in DataSourceFieldName is a
                            date field, you must specify the date  format.  If
                            the  field  is  not  a date field, an exception is
                            thrown.

                     a  query  response based on user context. The document is
                     only returned to users that are  in  one  of  the  groups
                     specified in the UserContext field of the Query API.

              SqlConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Provides information about how Amazon Kendra uses quote marks
                 around SQL identifiers when querying a database data source.

                 QueryIdentifiersEnclosingOption -> (string)
                     Determines whether Amazon Kendra encloses SQL identifiers
                     for  tables  and  column  names in double quotes (") when
                     making a database query.

                     By default, Amazon Kendra passes SQL identifiers the  way
                     that they are entered into the data source configuration.
                     It does not change the case  of  identifiers  or  enclose
                     them in quotes.

                     PostgreSQL  internally  converts  uppercase characters to
                     lower case characters  in  identifiers  unless  they  are
                     quoted.  Choosing  this  option  encloses  identifiers in
                     quotes so that PostgreSQL does not  convert  the  charac-
                     ter's case.

                     For  MySQL databases, you must enable the ansi_quotes op-
                     tion when you set this field to DOUBLE_QUOTES .

                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  an  Secrets  Managersecret
                 that contains the key/value pairs required to connect to your
                 Salesforce instance. The secret must contain a JSON structure
                 with the following keys:

                 o authenticationUrl  -  The OAUTH endpoint that Amazon Kendra
                   connects to get an OAUTH token.

                 o consumerKey - The application public key generated when you
                   created your Salesforce application.

                 o consumerSecret - The application private key generated when
                   you created your Salesforce application.

                 o password - The password associated with the user logging in
                   to the Salesforce instance.

                 o securityToken  - The token associated with the user logging
                   in to the Salesforce instance.

                 o username - The user name of the  user  logging  in  to  the

                 pattern,  the exclusion pattern takes precedence and the con-
                 tent isn't included in the index.

                 (string)

              ExclusionPatterns -> (list)
                 A list of regular expression patterns to exclude certain blog
                 posts, pages, spaces, or attachments in your Confluence. Con-

                 tent isn't included in the index.

                 (string)

              ProxyConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Configuration information to connect to your  Confluence  URL
                 instance via a web proxy. You can use this option for Conflu-
                 ence Server.

                 You must provide the website host name and port  number.  For
                 example, the host name of https://a.example.com/page1.html is
                 "a.example.com" and the port is 443, the  standard  port  for
                 HTTPS.

                 Web  proxy  credentials  are optional and you can use them to
                 connect to a web proxy server that requires basic authentica-
                 tion  of  user  name and password. To store web proxy creden-
                 tials, you use a secret in Secrets Manager.

                 It is recommended that you  follow  best  security  practices
                 when  configuring  your  web  proxy. This includes setting up
                 throttling, setting up logging and monitoring,  and  applying
                 security  patches  on  a  regular  basis. If you use your web
                 proxy with multiple data sources, sync jobs that occur at the
                 same  time  could strain the load on your proxy. It is recom-
                 mended you prepare your proxy beforehand for any security and
                 load requirements.

                 Host -> (string)
                     The name of the website host you want to connect to via a
                     web proxy server.

                     For      example,      the       host       name       of
                     https://a.example.com/page1.html is "a.example.com".

                 Port -> (integer)
                     The  port  number of the website host you want to connect
                     to via a web proxy server.

                     For         example,         the         port         for
                     https://a.example.com/page1.html  is  443,  the  standard
                     port for HTTPS.

                 Credentials -> (string)
                     Your secret ARN, which you can create in Secrets Manager

                     The credentials are optional. You use  a  secret  if  web
                     proxy  credentials  are  required to connect to a website
                     host. Amazon Kendra currently support  basic  authentica-
                     tion  to connect to a web proxy server. The secret stores
                     your credentials.

              AuthenticationType -> (string)
                 Whether you want to connect to Confluence using basic authen-
                 tication  of user name and password, or a personal access to-
                 ken. You can use  a  personal  access  token  for  Confluence
                 Server.

          GoogleDriveConfiguration -> (structure)
              Provides  the  configuration  information  to  connect to Google
              Drive as your data source.

                 Drive. For more information, see  Using  a  Google  Workspace
                 Drive data source .

              InclusionPatterns -> (list)
                 A  list  of  regular  expression  patterns to include certain
                 items in your  Google  Drive,  including  shared  drives  and
                 users'  My Drives. Items that match the patterns are included
                 in the index. Items that don't match  the  patterns  are  ex-
                 cluded  from  the index. If an item matches both an inclusion
                 and exclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes precedence
                 and the item isn't included in the index.

                 (string)

              ExclusionPatterns -> (list)
                 A  list  of  regular  expression  patterns to exclude certain
                 items in your  Google  Drive,  including  shared  drives  and
                 users'  My Drives. Items that match the patterns are excluded
                 from the index. Items that don't match the patterns  are  in-
                 cluded in the index. If an item matches both an inclusion and
                 exclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes precedence and
                 the item isn't included in the index.

                 (string)

                 Maps  Google  Drive  data source attributes or field names to
                 Amazon Kendra index field names. To create custom fields, use
                 the  UpdateIndex  API  before you map to Google Drive fields.
                 For more information, see Mapping data source  fields  .  The
                 Google  Drive  data  source  field  names  must exist in your
                 Google Drive custom metadata.

                 (structure)

                     from  the data source to Amazon Kendra index field names.
                     You can set up field mappings for each data  source  when
                     calling CreateDataSource or UpdateDataSource API. To cre-
                     ate custom fields, use the UpdateIndex API to first  cre-
                     ate an index field and then map to the data source field.
                     For more information, see Mapping data source fields .

                     DataSourceFieldName -> (string)

                     crawled. You can list up to three sitemap URLs.

                     SiteMaps -> (list)
                        The  list  of sitemap URLs of the websites you want to
                        crawl.

                        The list can include a maximum of three sitemap URLs.

                        (string)

              CrawlDepth -> (integer)
                 The 'depth' or number of levels from the seed level to crawl.
                 For  example, the seed URL page is depth 1 and any hyperlinks
                 on this page that are also crawled are depth 2.

              MaxLinksPerPage -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of URLs on a  web  page  to  include  when
                 crawling a website. This number is per web page.

                 As  a  websites web pages are crawled, any URLs the web pages
                 link to are also crawled. URLs on a web page are  crawled  in
                 order of appearance.

                 The default maximum links per page is 100.

              MaxContentSizePerPageInMegaBytes -> (float)
                 The  maximum  size  (in  MB)  of  a web page or attachment to
                 crawl.

                 Files larger than this size (in MB) are skipped/not crawled.

                 The default maximum size of a web page or attachment  is  set
                 to 50 MB.

              MaxUrlsPerMinuteCrawlRate -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  number  of  URLs  crawled  per website host per
                 minute.

                 A minimum of one URL is required.

                 The default maximum number of URLs crawled per  website  host
                 per minute is 300.

              UrlInclusionPatterns -> (list)
                 A list of regular expression patterns to include certain URLs
                 to crawl. URLs that match the patterns are  included  in  the
                 index.  URLs  that don't match the patterns are excluded from
                 the index. If a URL matches both an inclusion  and  exclusion
                 pattern,  the  exclusion pattern takes precedence and the URL
                 file isn't included in the index.

                 A list of regular expression patterns to exclude certain URLs
                 to  crawl. URLs that match the patterns are excluded from the
                 index. URLs that don't match the patterns are included in the
                 index.  If a URL matches both an inclusion and exclusion pat-
                 tern, the exclusion pattern takes precedence and the URL file
                 isn't included in the index.

                 (string)

              ProxyConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Configuration  information required to connect to your inter-
                 nal websites via a web proxy.

                 You must provide the website host name and port  number.  For
                 example, the host name of https://a.example.com/page1.html is
                 "a.example.com" and the port is 443, the  standard  port  for
                 HTTPS.

                 Web  proxy  credentials  are optional and you can use them to
                 connect to a web proxy server that requires basic authentica-

                     to via a web proxy server.

                     For         example,         the         port         for
                     https://a.example.com/page1.html  is  443,  the  standard
                     port for HTTPS.

                 Credentials -> (string)
                     Your secret ARN, which you can create in Secrets Manager

                     The  credentials  are  optional.  You use a secret if web
                     proxy credentials are required to connect  to  a  website
                     host.  Amazon  Kendra currently support basic authentica-
                     tion to connect to a web proxy server. The secret  stores
                     your credentials.

                 You can connect to websites  using  basic  authentication  of
                 user  name  and password. You use a secret in Secrets Manager
                 to store your authentication credentials.

                 You must provide the website host name and port  number.  For
                 example, the host name of https://a.example.com/page1.html is
                 "a.example.com" and the port is 443, the  standard  port  for

                            The  name  of the website host you want to connect
                            to using authentication credentials.

                            For     example,     the     host     name      of
                            https://a.example.com/page1.html    is    "a.exam-
                            ple.com".

                        Port -> (integer)
                            The port number of the website host  you  want  to
                            connect to using authentication credentials.

                            For        example,       the       port       for
                            https://a.example.com/page1.html is 443, the stan-

                 WorkDocs site repository.

                 You  can find the organization ID in the Directory Service by
                 going to Active Directory , then Directories  .  Your  Amazon
                 WorkDocs  site directory has an ID, which is the organization
                 ID. You can also set up a new Amazon  WorkDocs  directory  in
                 the  Directory  Service  console and enable a Amazon WorkDocs
                 site for the directory in the Amazon WorkDocs console.

              CrawlComments -> (boolean)
                     TRUE to include comments on documents in your index.  In-
                     cluding  comments  in  your index means each comment is a
                     document that can be searched on.

                 The default is set to FALSE .

              UseChangeLog -> (boolean)
                 TRUE to use the Amazon WorkDocs change log to determine which
                 documents  require  updating  in  the index. Depending on the
                 change log's size, it may take longer for  Amazon  Kendra  to
                 use the change log than to scan all of your documents in Ama-
                 zon WorkDocs.

              InclusionPatterns -> (list)
                 A list of regular  expression  patterns  to  include  certain
                 files  in  your  Amazon  WorkDocs site repository. Files that
                 match the patterns are included  in  the  index.  Files  that
                 don't  match  the  patterns are excluded from the index. If a
                 file matches both an inclusion and exclusion pattern, the ex-
                 clusion  pattern takes precedence and the file isn't included
                 in the index.

                 (string)

              ExclusionPatterns -> (list)
                 A list of regular  expression  patterns  to  exclude  certain
                 files  in  your  Amazon  WorkDocs site repository. Files that
                 match the patterns are excluded from the  index.  Files  that
                 dont  match the patterns are included in the index. If a file
                 matches both an inclusion and exclusion pattern,  the  exclu-
                 sion  pattern takes precedence and the file isn't included in
                 the index.

              FieldMappings -> (list)
                 A list of DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping objects that map Ama-
                 zon  WorkDocs data source attributes or field names to Amazon
                 Kendra index field names. To create custom  fields,  use  the
                 UpdateIndex API before you map to Amazon WorkDocs fields. For
                 more information, see Mapping data source fields . The Amazon
                 WorkDocs  data  source  field names must exist in your Amazon
                 WorkDocs custom metadata.

                 (structure)
                     Maps attributes or field names of  the  documents  synced
                     from  the data source to Amazon Kendra index field names.
                     You can set up field mappings for each data  source  when
                     calling CreateDataSource or UpdateDataSource API. To cre-
                     ate custom fields, use the UpdateIndex API to first  cre-
                     ate an index field and then map to the data source field.
                     For more information, see Mapping data source fields .

                     DataSourceFieldName -> (string)
                        The name of the field in the  data  source.  You  must
                        first  create  the  index  field using the UpdateIndex
                        API.

                     DateFieldFormat -> (string)
                        The format for date fields in the data source. If  the
                        field  specified  in  DataSourceFieldName  is  a  date
                        field, you must specify the date format. If the  field
                        is not a date field, an exception is thrown.

                     IndexFieldName -> (string)
                        The  name of the index field to map to the data source
                        field. The index field type must match the data source
                        field type.

          FsxConfiguration -> (structure)
              Provides  the configuration information to connect to Amazon FSx
              as your data source.

              NOTE:
                 Amazon Kendra now supports an  upgraded  Amazon  FSx  Windows
                 connector.

                 You  must now use the TemplateConfiguration object instead of
                 the FsxConfiguration object to configure your connector.

                 Connectors configured using the older console and API  archi-
                 tecture will continue to function as configured. However, you
                 won't be able to edit or update them. If you want to edit  or
                 update  your  connector  configuration, you must create a new
                 connector.

                 We recommended migrating your connector workflow to  the  up-
                 graded  version.  Support for connectors configured using the
                 older architecture is scheduled to end by June 2024.

              FileSystemId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the Amazon FSx file system.

                 You can find your file system ID on the file system dashboard
                 in the Amazon FSx console. For information on how to create a
                 file system in Amazon FSx console, using Windows File  Server

                 files in your Amazon FSx file system. Files  that  match  the
                 patterns  are  included  in the index. Files that don't match
                 the patterns are excluded from the index. If a  file  matches
                 both  an  inclusion and exclusion pattern, the exclusion pat-
                 tern takes precedence and the file isn't included in the  in-
                 dex.

                        field  specified  in  DataSourceFieldName  is  a  date
                        field,  you must specify the date format. If the field
                        is not a date field, an exception is thrown.

                     IndexFieldName -> (string)
                        The name of the index field to map to the data  source
                        field. The index field type must match the data source

          SlackConfiguration -> (structure)
              Provides the configuration information to connect  to  Slack  as
              your data source.

              NOTE:
                 Amazon Kendra now supports an upgraded Slack connector.

                 You  must now use the TemplateConfiguration object instead of
                 the SlackConfiguration object to configure your connector.

                 Connectors configured using the older console and API  archi-
                 tecture will continue to function as configured. However, you
                 won't be able to edit or update them. If you want to edit  or
                 update  your  connector  configuration, you must create a new
                 connector.

                 We recommended migrating your connector workflow to  the  up-
                 graded  version.  Support for connectors configured using the
                 older architecture is scheduled to end by June 2024.

                 Change log updates your index only if new content  was  added
                 since  you  last synced your data. Updated or deleted content
                 from before you last synced does not get updated in your  in-
                 dex.  To  capture  updated or deleted content before you last

                 regular expression patterns to filter public channels.

                 (string)

              InclusionPatterns -> (list)
                 A  list of regular expression patterns to include certain at-
                 tached files in your Slack workspace team. Files  that  match
                 the  patterns  are  included  in  the index. Files that don't
                 match the patterns are excluded from the  index.  If  a  file
                 matches  both  an inclusion and exclusion pattern, the exclu-
                 sion pattern takes precedence and the file isn't included  in

              NOTE:
                 Amazon Kendra now supports an upgraded GitHub connector.

                 You must now use the TemplateConfiguration object instead  of
                 the GitHubConfiguration object to configure your connector.

                 Connectors  configured using the older console and API archi-
                 tecture will continue to function as configured. However, you
                 wont  be  able to edit or update them. If you want to edit or
                 update your connector configuration, you must  create  a  new
                 connector.

                 We  recommended  migrating your connector workflow to the up-
                 graded version. Support for connectors configured  using  the
                 older architecture is scheduled to end by June 2024.

                 cluded in the index. If a folder matches  both  an  exclusion
                 and inclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes precedence
                 and the folder isn't included in the index.

                        the  target  attribute or metadata field that includes
                        the department names associated with the documents.

                     TargetDocumentAttributeValueDeletion -> (boolean)
                        TRUE to delete the  existing  target  value  for  your
                        specified  target  attribute  key. You cannot create a
                        target value and set this to TRUE . To create a target
                        value  (TargetDocumentAttributeValue  ),  set  this to
                        FALSE .

                     TargetDocumentAttributeValue -> (structure)
                        The target value you want to create for the target at-
                        tribute.

                        For  example,  'Finance' could be the target value for
                        the target attribute key 'Department'.

                        StringValue -> (string)
                            A string, such as "department".

                        StringListValue -> (list)
                            A list of strings. The default maximum  length  or
                            number of strings is 10.

                            A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                            It  is  important for the time zone to be included
                            in the ISO 8601  date-time  format.  For  example,
                            2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00    is   the   ISO   8601

              vanced logic for creating, modifying, or deleting document meta-
              data and content. For more information, see Advanced data manip-
              ulation .

                 The  condition  used for when a Lambda function should be in-
                 voked.

                 For example, you can specify a condition that  if  there  are
                 empty  date-time  values,  then Amazon Kendra should invoke a
                 function that inserts the current date-time.

                     The identifier of the document  attribute  used  for  the
                     condition.

                     For  example, 'Source_URI' could be an identifier for the
                     attribute or metadata field that contains source URIs as-
                     sociated with the documents.

                     Amazon  Kendra  currently does not support _document_body
                     as an attribute key used for the condition.

                 Operator -> (string)
                     The condition operator.

                     For example, you can use 'Contains' to partially match  a
                     string.

                 ConditionOnValue -> (structure)
                     The value used by the operator.

                     For  example,  you  can specify the value 'financial' for
                     strings in the 'Source_URI' field that partially match or
                     contain this value.

                     StringValue -> (string)
                        A string, such as "department".

              Lambda  on the structured documents with their metadata and text
              extracted. You can use a Lambda function to apply advanced logic
              for  creating, modifying, or deleting document metadata and con-
              tent. For more information, see Advanced data manipulation .

              InvocationCondition -> (structure)
                 The condition used for when a Lambda function should  be  in-
                 voked.
