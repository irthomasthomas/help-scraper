NAME
       describe-query-suggestions-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information on the settings of query suggestions for an index.

       This  is  used  to  check the current settings applied to query sugges-
       tions.
          DescribeQuerySuggestionsConfig is currently  not  supported  in  the
          Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US-West) region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-query-suggestions-config
          --index-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The  identifier of the index with query suggestions that you want to
          get information on.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Mode -> (string)
          Whether   query   suggestions  are  currently  in  ENABLED  mode  or
          LEARN_ONLY mode.

          By default, Amazon Kendra enables  query  suggestions.``LEARN_ONLY``
          turns  off query suggestions for your users. You can change the mode
          using the UpdateQuerySuggestionsConfig API.

       Status -> (string)
          Whether the status of query suggestions settings is currently ACTIVE
          or UPDATING .

          Active  means  the  current  settings  apply and Updating means your
          changed settings are in the process of applying.

       QueryLogLookBackWindowInDays -> (integer)
          How recent your queries are in your query log time window (in days).

       IncludeQueriesWithoutUserInformation -> (boolean)
          TRUE to use all queries, otherwise use  only  queries  that  include
          user information to generate the query suggestions.

       MinimumNumberOfQueryingUsers -> (integer)
          The  minimum number of unique users who must search a query in order
          for the query to be eligible to suggest to your users.

       MinimumQueryCount -> (integer)
          The minimum number of times a query must be searched  in  order  for
          the query to be eligible to suggest to your users.

       LastSuggestionsBuildTime -> (timestamp)
          The date-time query suggestions for an index was last updated.

       LastClearTime -> (timestamp)
          The date-time query suggestions for an index was last cleared.

          After  you  clear  suggestions, Amazon Kendra learns new suggestions
          based on new queries added to  the  query  log  from  the  time  you
          cleared suggestions. Amazon Kendra only considers re-occurences of a
          query from the time you cleared suggestions.

       TotalSuggestionsCount -> (integer)
          The current total count of query suggestions for an index.

          This count can change when you update your  query  suggestions  set-
          tings,  if  you  filter out certain queries from suggestions using a
          block list, and as the query log accumulates more queries for Amazon
          Kendra to learn from.
