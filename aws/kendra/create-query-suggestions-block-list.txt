NAME
       create-query-suggestions-block-list -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a block list to exlcude certain queries from suggestions.

       Any query that contains words or phrases specified in the block list is
       blocked or filtered out from being shown as a suggestion.

       You need to provide the file location of your block list text  file  in
       your S3 bucket. In your text file, enter each block word or phrase on a
       separate line.

       For information on the current quota limits for block lists, see Quotas
       for Amazon Kendra .
          CreateQuerySuggestionsBlockList  is  currently  not supported in the
          Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US-West) region.

       For an example of creating a block list for query suggestions using the
       Python SDK, see Query suggestions block list .

       --client-token (string)
          A  token  that you provide to identify the request to create a query
          suggestions block list.

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role with permission to ac-
          cess your S3 bucket that contains the block list text file. For more

       --tags (list)
          A list of key-value pairs that  identify  or  categorize  the  block
          list.  Tag  keys  and values can consist of Unicode letters, digits,

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-

       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
