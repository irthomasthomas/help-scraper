BATCH-PUT-DOCUMENT()                                      BATCH-PUT-DOCUMENT()



NAME
       batch-put-document -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds one or more documents to an index.

       The  BatchPutDocument  API  enables you to ingest inline documents or a
       set of documents stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use this API to  ingest
       your text and unstructured text into an index, add custom attributes to
       the documents, and to attach an access control list  to  the  documents
       added to the index.

       The  documents  are indexed asynchronously. You can see the progress of
       the batch using Amazon Web Services CloudWatch. Any error messages  re-
       lated  to  processing  the  batch  are sent to your Amazon Web Services
       CloudWatch log.

       For an example of ingesting inline  documents  using  Python  and  Java
       SDKs, see Adding files directly to an index .

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  index to add the documents to. You need to
          create the index first using the CreateIndex API.

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role with permission to ac-
          cess  your S3 bucket. For more information, see IAM access roles for
          Amazon Kendra .

       --documents (list)
          One or more documents to add to the index.

          Documents have the following file size limits.

          o 50 MB total size for any file

          o 5 MB extracted text for any file

          For more information, see Quotas .

          (structure)
              A document in an index.

              Id -> (string)
                 A identifier of the document in the index.

                 Note, each document ID must be unique per index.  You  cannot
                 create  a  data  source  to  index  your documents with their
                 unique IDs and then use the BatchPutDocument API to index the
                 same  documents,  or vice versa. You can delete a data source
                 and then use the BatchPutDocument API to index the same docu-
                 ments, or vice versa.

              Title -> (string)
                 The title of the document.

              Blob -> (blob)
                 The contents of the document.

                 Documents  passed  to  the  Blob parameter must be base64 en-
                 coded. Your code might not need to encode the  document  file
                 bytes if you're using an Amazon Web Services SDK to call Ama-
                 zon Kendra APIs. If you are calling the  Amazon  Kendra  end-
                 point  directly  using  REST, you must base64 encode the con-
                 tents before sending.

              S3Path -> (structure)
                 Information required to find a specific file in an Amazon  S3
                 bucket.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     The name of the S3 bucket that contains the file.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name of the file.

              Attributes -> (list)
                 Custom  attributes  to  apply to the document. Use the custom
                 attributes to provide additional information  for  searching,
                 to provide facets for refining searches, and to provide addi-
                 tional information in the query response.

                 For example,  'DataSourceId'  and  'DataSourceSyncJobId'  are
                 custom  attributes  that  provide information on the synchro-
                 nization of documents running on a data source. Note,  'Data-
                 SourceSyncJobId'  could  be  an  optional custom attribute as
                 Amazon Kendra will use the ID of a running sync job.

                 (structure)
                     A document attribute or metadata field. To create  custom
                     document attributes, see Custom attributes .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The identifier for the attribute.

                     Value -> (structure)
                        The value of the attribute.

                        StringValue -> (string)
                            A string, such as "department".

                        StringListValue -> (list)
                            A  list  of strings. The default maximum length or
                            number of strings is 10.

                            (string)

                        LongValue -> (long)
                            A long integer value.

                        DateValue -> (timestamp)
                            A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                            It is important for the time zone to  be  included
                            in  the  ISO  8601  date-time format. For example,
                            2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00   is   the   ISO    8601
                            date-time  format  for  March 25th 2012 at 12:30PM

              HierarchicalAccessControlList -> (list)
                 The list of principal lists that  define  the  hierarchy  for
                 which documents users should have access to.

                 (structure)
                     Information  to  define the hierarchy for which documents
                     users should have access to.

       --custom-document-enrichment-configuration (structure)
          Configuration information for altering your  document  metadata  and
          content  during  the  document  ingestion  process  when you use the
          BatchPutDocument API.

          For more information on how to create, modify  and  delete  document
          metadata,  or  make  other content alterations when you ingest docu-
          ments into Amazon Kendra, see Customizing document  metadata  during
          the ingestion process .

          InlineConfigurations -> (list)
              Configuration  information to alter document attributes or meta-
              data fields and content when  ingesting  documents  into  Amazon
              Kendra.

              (structure)
                 Provides  the  configuration  information  for applying basic
                 logic to alter document metadata and content  when  ingesting
                 documents  into Amazon Kendra. To apply advanced logic, to go
                 beyond   what   you   can   do   with   basic   logic,    see
                 HookConfiguration .

                 For  more information, see Customizing document metadata dur-
                 ing the ingestion process .

                 Condition -> (structure)
                     Configuration of the condition used for the target  docu-
                     ment attribute or metadata field when ingesting documents
                     into Amazon Kendra.

                     ConditionDocumentAttributeKey -> (string)
                        The identifier of the document attribute used for  the
                        condition.

                        For  example,  'Source_URI' could be an identifier for
                        the attribute or metadata field that  contains  source
                        URIs associated with the documents.

                        Amazon   Kendra  currently  does  not  support  _docu-
                        ment_body as an attribute key used for the condition.

                     Operator -> (string)
                        The condition operator.

                        For example, you can use 'Contains' to partially match
                        a string.

                     ConditionOnValue -> (structure)
                        The value used by the operator.

                        For example, you can specify the value 'financial' for
                        strings in the 'Source_URI' field that partially match
                        or contain this value.

                        StringValue -> (string)
                            A string, such as "department".

                        StringListValue -> (list)
                            A  list  of strings. The default maximum length or
                            number of strings is 10.

                            (string)

                        LongValue -> (long)
                            A long integer value.

                        DateValue -> (timestamp)
                            A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                            It is important for the time zone to  be  included
                            in  the  ISO  8601  date-time format. For example,
                            2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00   is   the   ISO    8601
                            date-time  format  for  March 25th 2012 at 12:30PM
                            (plus 10 seconds) in Central European Time.

                 Target -> (structure)
                     Configuration of the target document attribute  or  meta-
                     data  field  when ingesting documents into Amazon Kendra.
                     You can also include a value.

                     TargetDocumentAttributeKey -> (string)
                        The identifier of the  target  document  attribute  or
                        metadata field.

                        For  example,  'Department' could be an identifier for
                        the target attribute or metadata field  that  includes
                        the department names associated with the documents.

                     TargetDocumentAttributeValueDeletion -> (boolean)
                        TRUE  to  delete  the  existing  target value for your
                        specified target attribute key. You  cannot  create  a
                        target value and set this to TRUE . To create a target
                        value (TargetDocumentAttributeValue  ),  set  this  to
                        FALSE .

                     TargetDocumentAttributeValue -> (structure)
                        The target value you want to create for the target at-
                        tribute.

                        For example, 'Finance' could be the target  value  for
                        the target attribute key 'Department'.

                        StringValue -> (string)
                            A string, such as "department".

                        StringListValue -> (list)
                            A  list  of strings. The default maximum length or
                            number of strings is 10.

                            (string)

                        LongValue -> (long)
                            A long integer value.

                        DateValue -> (timestamp)
                            A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                            It is important for the time zone to  be  included
                            in  the  ISO  8601  date-time format. For example,
                            2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00   is   the   ISO    8601
                            date-time  format  for  March 25th 2012 at 12:30PM
                            (plus 10 seconds) in Central European Time.

                 DocumentContentDeletion -> (boolean)
                     TRUE to delete content if the condition used for the tar-

          PreExtractionHookConfiguration -> (structure)
              Configuration  information  for  invoking  a  Lambda function in
              Lambda on the original or raw documents before extracting  their
              metadata  and  text.  You can use a Lambda function to apply ad-
              vanced logic for creating, modifying, or deleting document meta-
              data and content. For more information, see Advanced data manip-
              ulation .

              InvocationCondition -> (structure)
                 The condition used for when a Lambda function should  be  in-
                 voked.

                 For  example,  you  can specify a condition that if there are
                 empty date-time values, then Amazon Kendra  should  invoke  a
                 function that inserts the current date-time.

                 ConditionDocumentAttributeKey -> (string)
                     The  identifier  of  the  document attribute used for the
                     condition.

                     For example, 'Source_URI' could be an identifier for  the
                     attribute or metadata field that contains source URIs as-
                     sociated with the documents.

                     Amazon Kendra currently does not  support  _document_body
                     as an attribute key used for the condition.

                 Operator -> (string)
                     The condition operator.

                     For  example, you can use 'Contains' to partially match a
                     string.

                 ConditionOnValue -> (structure)
                     The value used by the operator.

                     For example, you can specify the  value  'financial'  for
                     strings in the 'Source_URI' field that partially match or
                     contain this value.

                     StringValue -> (string)
                        A string, such as "department".

                     StringListValue -> (list)
                        A list of strings. The default maximum length or  num-
                        ber of strings is 10.

                        (string)

                     LongValue -> (long)
                        A long integer value.

                     DateValue -> (timestamp)
                        A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                        It  is  important  for the time zone to be included in
                        the  ISO   8601   date-time   format.   For   example,
                        2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00  is  the  ISO 8601 date-time
                        format for March 25th 2012 at 12:30PM  (plus  10  sec-
                        onds) in Central European Time.

              LambdaArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of a role with permission to
                 run a Lambda function during ingestion. For more information,
                 see IAM roles for Amazon Kendra .

              S3Bucket -> (string)
                 Stores  the original, raw documents or the structured, parsed
                 documents before and after altering them. For  more  informa-

          PostExtractionHookConfiguration -> (structure)
              Configuration  information  for  invoking  a  Lambda function in
              Lambda on the structured documents with their metadata and  text
              extracted. You can use a Lambda function to apply advanced logic
              for creating, modifying, or deleting document metadata and  con-
              tent. For more information, see Advanced data manipulation .

              InvocationCondition -> (structure)
                 The  condition  used for when a Lambda function should be in-
                 voked.

                 For example, you can specify a condition that  if  there  are
                 empty  date-time  values,  then Amazon Kendra should invoke a
                 function that inserts the current date-time.

                 ConditionDocumentAttributeKey -> (string)
                     The identifier of the document  attribute  used  for  the
                     condition.

                     attribute or metadata field that contains source URIs as-
                     sociated with the documents.

                     Amazon  Kendra  currently does not support _document_body
                     as an attribute key used for the condition.

                 Operator -> (string)
                     The condition operator.

                     For example, you can use 'Contains' to partially match  a

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
