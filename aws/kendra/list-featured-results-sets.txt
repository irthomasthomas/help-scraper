OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index used for featuring results.

       --next-token (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon Kendra returns a pagination to-
          ken  in  the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve
          the next set of featured results sets.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of featured results sets to return.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

          sets.

          (structure)
              Summary information for a set of featured results. Featured  re-
              sults are placed above all other results for certain queries. If
              there's an exact match of a query, then  one  or  more  specific
              documents are featured in the search results.

              FeaturedResultsSetId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the set of featured results.

              FeaturedResultsSetName -> (string)

              Status -> (string)
                 The  current  status of the set of featured results. When the
                 value is ACTIVE , featured results are ready for use. You can
                 still  configure  your  settings before setting the status to
                 ACTIVE . You can set the status to ACTIVE or  INACTIVE  using
                 the UpdateFeaturedResultsSet API. The queries you specify for
                 featured results must be unique per featured results set  for
                 each index, whether the status is ACTIVE or INACTIVE .

              LastUpdatedTimestamp -> (long)
                 The  Unix timestamp when the set of featured results was last
                 updated.

              CreationTimestamp -> (long)
                 The Unix timestamp when the set of featured results was  cre-
                 ated.
