OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The identifier of the index you want to update.

       --name (string)
          A new name for the index.

       --role-arn (string)
          An  Identity  and  Access  Management  (IAM)  role that gives Amazon
          Kendra permission to access Amazon CloudWatch logs and metrics.

       --description (string)
          A new description for the index.

       --document-metadata-configuration-updates (list)
          The document metadata configuration you want to update for  the  in-
          dex. Document metadata are fields or attributes associated with your
          documents. For example, the company department name associated  with
          each document.

          (structure)
              Specifies  the properties, such as relevance tuning and searcha-
              bility, of an index field.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the index field.

              Type -> (string)
                 The data type of the index field.

              Relevance -> (structure)
                 Provides tuning parameters to determine how the field affects
                 the search results.

                 Freshness -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  that this field determines how "fresh" a docu-
                     ment is. For example, if document 1 was created on Novem-
                     ber 5, and document 2 was created on October 31, document
                     1 is "fresher" than document  2.  Only  applies  to  DATE
                     fields.

                 Importance -> (integer)
                     The  relative  importance  of  the  field  in the search.
                     Larger numbers provide more of a boost than smaller  num-
                     bers.

                 Duration -> (string)
                     Specifies  the time period that the boost applies to. For
                     example, to make the boost apply to  documents  with  the
                     field   value  within  the  last  month,  you  would  use
                     "2628000s". Once the field value is beyond the  specified
                     range,  the effect of the boost drops off. The higher the
                     importance, the faster the effect drops off. If you don't
                     specify  a  value,  the default is 3 months. The value of
                     the field is a numeric string followed by  the  character
                     "s",  for  example "86400s" for one day, or "604800s" for
                     one week.

                     Only applies to DATE fields.

                 RankOrder -> (string)
                     Determines how values should be interpreted.

                     When the RankOrder field is ASCENDING  ,  higher  numbers
                     are  better.  For example, a document with a rating score
                     of 10 is higher ranking than a  document  with  a  rating
                     score of 1.

                     When  the  RankOrder  field is DESCENDING , lower numbers
                     are better. For example, in a task tracking  application,
                     a  priority  1  task  is more important than a priority 5
                     task.

                     Only applies to LONG fields.

                 ValueImportanceMap -> (map)
                     A list of values that should be given a  different  boost
                     when  they appear in the result list. For example, if you
                     are boosting a field  called  "department",  query  terms
                     that  match  the  department field are boosted in the re-
                     sult. However, you can add entries  from  the  department
                     field to boost documents with those values higher.

                     For example, you can add entries to the map with names of
                     departments. If you add "HR",5 and  "Legal",3  those  de-
                     partments are given special attention when they appear in
                     the metadata of a document. When those terms appear  they
                     are given the specified importance instead of the regular
                     importance for the boost.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (integer)

              Search -> (structure)
                 Provides information about how the field  is  used  during  a
                 search.

                 Facetable -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  that  the  field  can be used to create search
                     facets, a count of results for each value in  the  field.
                     The default is false .

                 Searchable -> (boolean)
                     Determines  whether  the  field is used in the search. If
                     the Searchable field is true , you can use relevance tun-
                     ing  to manually tune how Amazon Kendra weights the field
                     in the search. The default is true for string fields  and
                     false for number and date fields.

                 Displayable -> (boolean)
                     Determines whether the field is returned in the query re-
                     sponse. The default is true .

                 Sortable -> (boolean)
                     Determines whether the field can be used to sort the  re-
                     sults  of a query. If you specify sorting on a field that
                     does not have Sortable set to true ,  Amazon  Kendra  re-
                     turns an exception. The default is false .

            ...
          ]

       --capacity-units (structure)
          Sets  the  number  of additional document storage and query capacity
          units that should be used by the index. You can change the  capacity
          of the index up to 5 times per day, or make 5 API calls.

          If  you  are using extra storage units, you can't reduce the storage
          capacity below what is required to meet the storage needs  for  your
          index.

          StorageCapacityUnits -> (integer)
              The  amount of extra storage capacity for an index. A single ca-
              pacity unit provides 30 GB of storage  space  or  100,000  docu-
              ments,  whichever  is reached first. You can add up to 100 extra
              capacity units.

          QueryCapacityUnits -> (integer)
              The  amount  of  extra  query  capacity   for   an   index   and
              GetQuerySuggestions capacity.

              A  single  extra capacity unit for an index provides 0.1 queries
              per second or approximately 8,000 queries per day. You  can  add
              up to 100 extra capacity units.
                 GetQuerySuggestions  capacity  is  five times the provisioned
                 query capacity for an index, or  the  base  capacity  of  2.5
                 calls  per second, whichever is higher. For example, the base
                 capacity for an index is 0.1 queries  per  second,  and  Get-
                 QuerySuggestions capacity has a base of 2.5 calls per second.
                 If you add another  0.1  queries  per  second  to  total  0.2
                 queries  per second for an index, the GetQuerySuggestions ca-
                 pacity is 2.5 calls per second (higher than  five  times  0.2
                 queries per second).

       --user-group-resolution-configuration (structure)
          Gets  users  and groups from IAM Identity Center identity source. To
          configure this, see UserGroupResolutionConfiguration . This is  use-
          ful  for  user  context filtering, where search results are filtered
          based on the user or their group access to documents.

          UserGroupResolutionMode -> (string)
              The identity store provider (mode) you want to use to get  users
              and  groups. IAM Identity Center is currently the only available
              mode. Your users and groups must exist in an IAM Identity Center
              identity source in order to use this mode.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          UserGroupResolutionMode=string

       JSON Syntax:

            "UserGroupResolutionMode": "AWS_SSO"|"NONE"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
