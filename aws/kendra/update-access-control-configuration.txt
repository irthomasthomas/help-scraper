NAME
       update-access-control-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates an access control configuration for your documents in an index.
       This includes user and group access  information  for  your  documents.
       This  is  useful  for  user context filtering, where search results are
       filtered based on the user or their group access to documents.

       You can update an access control configuration you created without  in-
       dexing  all  of  your documents again. For example, your index contains
       top-secret company documents  that  only  certain  employees  or  users
       should  access. You created an 'allow' access control configuration for
       one user who recently joined the 'top-secret' team,  switching  from  a
       team with 'deny' access to top-secret documents. However, the user sud-
       denly returns to their previous team and should no longer  have  access
       to  top  secret documents. You can update the access control configura-
       tion to re-configure access control for your documents as circumstances
       change.

       You  call  the BatchPutDocument API to apply the updated access control
       configuration, with the AccessControlConfigurationId  included  in  the
       Document object. If you use an S3 bucket as a data source, you synchro-
       nize your data source to apply the AccessControlConfigurationId in  the
       .metadata.json  file. Amazon Kendra currently only supports access con-
       trol configuration for S3 data sources and documents indexed using  the
       BatchPutDocument API.

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index for an access control configuration.

       --id (string)

       --access-control-list (list)
          Information you want to update on principals (users  and/or  groups)
          and  which  documents they should have access to. This is useful for
          user context filtering, where search results are filtered  based  on
          the user or their group access to documents.

          (structure)
              Provides user and group information for user context filtering .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the user or group.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of principal.

              Access -> (string)
                 Whether to allow or deny document access to the principal.

              DataSourceId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the data source the principal should access
                 documents from.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Type=string,Access=string,DataSourceId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {

            ...
          ]

       --hierarchical-access-control-list (list)

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
