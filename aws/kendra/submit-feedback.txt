       --query-id (string)

       --click-feedback-items (list)
          Tells Amazon Kendra that a particular search result link was  chosen
          by the user.

          (structure)
              Gathers  information  about when a particular result was clicked
              by a user. Your application uses the SubmitFeedback API to  pro-
              vide click information.

              ResultId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the search result that was clicked.

              ClickTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  Unix  timestamp of the date and time that the result was
                 clicked.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResultId=string,ClickTime=timestamp ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ResultId": "string",
              "ClickTime": timestamp
            }
            ...
          ]

       --relevance-feedback-items (list)
          Provides Amazon Kendra with relevant or not  relevant  feedback  for
          whether a particular item was relevant to the search.

          (structure)
              Provides  feedback  on  how  relevant a document is to a search.
              Your application uses the SubmitFeedback API  to  provide  rele-
              vance information.

              ResultId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of  the search result that the user provided
                 relevance feedback for.

              RelevanceValue -> (string)
                 Whether to document was  relevant  or  not  relevant  to  the
                 search.

          ResultId=string,RelevanceValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ResultId": "string",
              "RelevanceValue": "RELEVANT"|"NOT_RELEVANT"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
