          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The identifier of the index you want to get information on.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Name -> (string)
          The name of the index.

       Id -> (string)
          The identifier of the index.

       Edition -> (string)
          The Amazon Kendra edition used for the index. You decide the edition
          when you create the index.

       RoleArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the IAM role that gives Amazon
          Kendra permission to write to your Amazon Cloudwatch logs.

       ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
          The identifier of the KMScustomer master key (CMK) that is  used  to
          encrypt your data. Amazon Kendra doesn't support asymmetric CMKs.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              The  identifier  of  the  KMS key. Amazon Kendra doesn't support
              asymmetric keys.

       Status -> (string)
          The current status of the index. When the value is ACTIVE , the  in-
          dex  is ready for use. If the Status field value is FAILED , the Er-
          rorMessage field contains a message that explains why.

       Description -> (string)
          The description for the index.

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The Unix datetime that the index was created.

       UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The Unix datetime that the index was last updated.

       DocumentMetadataConfigurations -> (list)
          Configuration information for document metadata or fields.  Document
          metadata  are  fields  or attributes associated with your documents.
          For example, the company department name associated with each  docu-
          ment.

          (structure)
              Specifies  the properties, such as relevance tuning and searcha-
              bility, of an index field.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the index field.

              Type -> (string)
                 The data type of the index field.

              Relevance -> (structure)
                 Provides tuning parameters to determine how the field affects
                 the search results.

                 Freshness -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  that this field determines how "fresh" a docu-
                     ment is. For example, if document 1 was created on Novem-
                     ber 5, and document 2 was created on October 31, document
                     1 is "fresher" than document 2.  You  can  only  set  the
                     Freshness  field  on one DATE type field. Only applies to
                     DATE fields.

                 Importance -> (integer)
                     The relative importance  of  the  field  in  the  search.
                     Larger  numbers provide more of a boost than smaller num-
                     bers.

                 Duration -> (string)
                     Specifies the time period that the boost applies to.  For
                     example,  to  make  the boost apply to documents with the
                     field  value  within  the  last  month,  you  would   use
                     "2628000s".  Once the field value is beyond the specified
                     range, the effect of the boost drops off. The higher  the
                     importance, the faster the effect drops off. If you don't
                     specify a value, the default is 3 months.  The  value  of
                     the  field  is a numeric string followed by the character
                     "s", for example "86400s" for one day, or  "604800s"  for
                     one week.

                     Only applies to DATE fields.

                 RankOrder -> (string)
                     Determines how values should be interpreted.

                     When  the  RankOrder  field is ASCENDING , higher numbers
                     are better. For example, a document with a  rating  score
                     of  10  is  higher  ranking than a document with a rating
                     score of 1.

                     When the RankOrder field is DESCENDING  ,  lower  numbers
                     are  better. For example, in a task tracking application,
                     a priority 1 task is more important  than  a  priority  5
                     task.

                     Only applies to LONG and DOUBLE fields.

                 ValueImportanceMap -> (map)
                     A  list  of values that should be given a different boost
                     when they appear in the result list. For example, if  you
                     are  boosting  a  field  called "department," query terms
                     that match the department field are boosted  in  the  re-
                     sult.  However,  you  can add entries from the department
                     field to boost documents with those values higher.

                     For example, you can add entries to the map with names of
                     departments.  If  you  add "HR",5 and "Legal",3 those de-
                     partments are given special attention when they appear in
                     the  metadata of a document. When those terms appear they
                     are given the specified importance instead of the regular
                     importance for the boost.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (integer)

              Search -> (structure)
                 Provides  information  about  how  the field is used during a
                 search.

                 Facetable -> (boolean)
                     Indicates that the field can be  used  to  create  search
                     facets,  a  count of results for each value in the field.
                     The default is false .

                 Searchable -> (boolean)
                     Determines whether the field is used in  the  search.  If
                     the Searchable field is true , you can use relevance tun-
                     ing to manually tune how Amazon Kendra weights the  field
                     in  the search. The default is true for string fields and
                     false for number and date fields.

                 Displayable -> (boolean)
                     Determines whether the field is returned in the query re-
                     sponse. The default is true .

                 Sortable -> (boolean)
                     Determines  whether the field can be used to sort the re-
                     sults of a query. If you specify sorting on a field  that
                     does  not  have  Sortable set to true , Amazon Kendra re-
                     turns an exception. The default is false .

       IndexStatistics -> (structure)
          Provides information about the number of FAQ questions  and  answers
          and the number of text documents indexed.

          FaqStatistics -> (structure)
              The number of question and answer topics in the index.

              IndexedQuestionAnswersCount -> (integer)
                 The  total  number  of FAQ questions and answers contained in
                 the index.

          TextDocumentStatistics -> (structure)
              The number of text documents indexed.

              IndexedTextDocumentsCount -> (integer)
                 The number of text documents indexed.

              IndexedTextBytes -> (long)
                 The total size, in bytes, of the indexed documents.

       ErrorMessage -> (string)
          When the Status field value is FAILED , the ErrorMessage field  con-
          tains a message that explains why.

       CapacityUnits -> (structure)
          For Enterprise Edition indexes, you can choose to use additional ca-
          pacity to meet the needs of your application. This contains the  ca-
          pacity  units used for the index. A query or document storage capac-
          ity of zero indicates that the index is using the default  capacity.
          For  more  information  on the default capacity for an index and ad-
          justing this, see Adjusting capacity .

          StorageCapacityUnits -> (integer)
              The amount of extra storage capacity for an index. A single  ca-
              pacity  unit  provides  30  GB of storage space or 100,000 docu-
              ments, whichever is reached first. You can add up to  100  extra
              capacity units.

          QueryCapacityUnits -> (integer)
              The   amount   of   extra   query  capacity  for  an  index  and
              GetQuerySuggestions capacity.

              A single extra capacity unit for an index provides  0.1  queries
              per  second  or approximately 8,000 queries per day. You can add
              up to 100 extra capacity units.
                 GetQuerySuggestions capacity is five  times  the  provisioned
                 query  capacity  for  an  index,  or the base capacity of 2.5
                 calls per second, whichever is higher. For example, the  base
                 capacity  for  an  index  is 0.1 queries per second, and Get-
                 QuerySuggestions capacity has a base of 2.5 calls per second.
                 If  you  add  another  0.1  queries  per  second to total 0.2
                 queries per second for an index, the GetQuerySuggestions  ca-
                 pacity  is  2.5  calls per second (higher than five times 0.2
                 queries per second).

       UserTokenConfigurations -> (list)
          The user token configuration for the Amazon Kendra index.

          (structure)
              Provides the configuration information for a token.

              JwtTokenTypeConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Information about the JWT token type configuration.

                 KeyLocation -> (string)
                     The location of the key.

                 URL -> (string)
                     The signing key URL.

                 SecretManagerArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (arn) of the secret.

                 UserNameAttributeField -> (string)
                     The user name attribute field.

                 GroupAttributeField -> (string)
                     The group attribute field.

                 Issuer -> (string)
                     The issuer of the token.

                 ClaimRegex -> (string)
                     The regular expression that identifies the claim.

              JsonTokenTypeConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Information about the JSON token type configuration.

                 UserNameAttributeField -> (string)
                     The user name attribute field.

                 GroupAttributeField -> (string)
                     The group attribute field.

       UserContextPolicy -> (string)
          The user context policy for the Amazon Kendra index.

       UserGroupResolutionConfiguration -> (structure)
          Whether you have enabled the configuration for fetching access  lev-
          els  of  groups  and users from an IAM Identity Center (successor to
          Single Sign-On) identity source.

          UserGroupResolutionMode -> (string)
              The identity store provider (mode) you want to use to fetch  ac-
              cess  levels of groups and users. IAM Identity Center (successor
              to Single Sign-On) is currently the only  available  mode.  Your
              users  and  groups must exist in an IAM Identity Center identity
              source in order to use this mode.
