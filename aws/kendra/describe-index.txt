SYNOPSIS
            describe-index
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The identifier of the index you want to get information on.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about an Amazon Kendra index

       The following describe-index gets information about  an  Amazon  Kendra
       index.  You  can view the configuration of an index, and read any error
       messages if the status shows an index "FAILED" to completely create.

          aws kendra describe-index \
              --id exampleindex1

       and data source connector in the Amazon Kendra Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Name -> (string)
          The name of the index.

       Id -> (string)
          The identifier of the index.

       Edition -> (string)
          The Amazon Kendra edition used for the index. You decide the edition
          when you create the index.

       RoleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM  role  that  gives  Amazon
          Kendra permission to write to your Amazon CloudWatch logs.

       ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
          The  identifier of the KMS customer master key (CMK) that is used to
          encrypt your data. Amazon Kendra doesn't support asymmetric CMKs.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              The identifier of the KMS key.  Amazon  Kendra  doesn't  support
              asymmetric keys.

       Status -> (string)
          The  current status of the index. When the value is ACTIVE , the in-
          dex is ready for use. If the Status field value is FAILED , the  Er-
          rorMessage field contains a message that explains why.

       Description -> (string)
          The description for the index.

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The Unix timestamp when the index was created.

       UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The Unix timestamp when the index was last updated.

       DocumentMetadataConfigurations -> (list)
          Configuration  information for document metadata or fields. Document
          metadata are fields or attributes associated  with  your  documents.
          For  example, the company department name associated with each docu-
          ment.

          (structure)
              Specifies the properties, such as relevance tuning and  searcha-
              bility, of an index field.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the index field.

              Type -> (string)
                 The data type of the index field.

              Relevance -> (structure)
                 Provides tuning parameters to determine how the field affects
                 the search results.

                 Freshness -> (boolean)
                     Indicates that this field determines how "fresh" a  docu-
                     ment is. For example, if document 1 was created on Novem-
                     ber 5, and document 2 was created on October 31, document
                     1  is  "fresher"  than  document  2. Only applies to DATE
                     fields.

                 Importance -> (integer)
                     The relative importance  of  the  field  in  the  search.
                     Larger  numbers provide more of a boost than smaller num-
                     bers.

                 Duration -> (string)
                     Specifies the time period that the boost applies to.  For
                     example,  to  make  the boost apply to documents with the
                     field  value  within  the  last  month,  you  would   use
                     "2628000s".  Once the field value is beyond the specified
                     range, the effect of the boost drops off. The higher  the
                     importance, the faster the effect drops off. If you don't
                     specify a value, the default is 3 months.  The  value  of
                     the  field  is a numeric string followed by the character
                     "s", for example "86400s" for one day, or  "604800s"  for
                     one week.

                     Only applies to DATE fields.

                 RankOrder -> (string)
                     Determines how values should be interpreted.

                     When  the  RankOrder  field is ASCENDING , higher numbers
                     are better. For example, a document with a  rating  score
                     of  10  is  higher  ranking than a document with a rating
                     score of 1.

                     When the RankOrder field is DESCENDING  ,  lower  numbers
                     are  better. For example, in a task tracking application,
                     a priority 1 task is more important  than  a  priority  5
                     task.

                     Only applies to LONG fields.

                 ValueImportanceMap -> (map)
                     A  list  of values that should be given a different boost
                     when they appear in the result list. For example, if  you
                     are  boosting  a  field  called "department", query terms
                     that match the department field are boosted  in  the  re-
                     sult.  However,  you  can add entries from the department
                     field to boost documents with those values higher.

                     For example, you can add entries to the map with names of
                     departments.  If  you  add "HR",5 and "Legal",3 those de-
                     partments are given special attention when they appear in
                     the  metadata of a document. When those terms appear they
                     are given the specified importance instead of the regular
                     importance for the boost.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (integer)

              Search -> (structure)
                 Provides  information  about  how  the field is used during a
                 search.

                 Facetable -> (boolean)
                     Indicates that the field can be  used  to  create  search
                     facets,  a  count of results for each value in the field.
                     The default is false .

                 Searchable -> (boolean)
                     Determines whether the field is used in  the  search.  If
                     the Searchable field is true , you can use relevance tun-
                     ing to manually tune how Amazon Kendra weights the  field
                     in  the search. The default is true for string fields and
                     false for number and date fields.

                 Displayable -> (boolean)
                     Determines whether the field is returned in the query re-
                     sponse. The default is true .

                 Sortable -> (boolean)
                     Determines  whether the field can be used to sort the re-
                     sults of a query. If you specify sorting on a field  that
                     does  not  have  Sortable set to true , Amazon Kendra re-
                     turns an exception. The default is false .

       IndexStatistics -> (structure)
          Provides information about the number of FAQ questions  and  answers
          and the number of text documents indexed.

          FaqStatistics -> (structure)
              The number of question and answer topics in the index.

              IndexedQuestionAnswersCount -> (integer)
                 The total number of FAQ questions and answers for an index.

          TextDocumentStatistics -> (structure)
              The number of text documents indexed.

              IndexedTextDocumentsCount -> (integer)
                 The number of text documents indexed.

              IndexedTextBytes -> (long)
                 The total size, in bytes, of the indexed documents.

       ErrorMessage -> (string)
          When  the Status field value is FAILED , the ErrorMessage field con-
          tains a message that explains why.

       CapacityUnits -> (structure)
          For Enterprise Edition indexes, you can choose to use additional ca-
          pacity  to meet the needs of your application. This contains the ca-
          pacity units used for the index. A query or document storage  capac-
          ity  of zero indicates that the index is using the default capacity.
          For more information on the default capacity for an  index  and  ad-
          justing this, see Adjusting capacity .

          StorageCapacityUnits -> (integer)
              The  amount of extra storage capacity for an index. A single ca-
              pacity unit provides 30 GB of storage  space  or  100,000  docu-
              ments,  whichever  is reached first. You can add up to 100 extra
              capacity units.

          QueryCapacityUnits -> (integer)
              The  amount  of  extra  query  capacity   for   an   index   and
              GetQuerySuggestions capacity.

              A  single  extra capacity unit for an index provides 0.1 queries
              per second or approximately 8,000 queries per day. You  can  add
              up to 100 extra capacity units.
                 GetQuerySuggestions  capacity  is  five times the provisioned
                 query capacity for an index, or  the  base  capacity  of  2.5
                 calls  per second, whichever is higher. For example, the base
                 capacity for an index is 0.1 queries  per  second,  and  Get-
                 QuerySuggestions capacity has a base of 2.5 calls per second.
                 If you add another  0.1  queries  per  second  to  total  0.2
                 queries  per second for an index, the GetQuerySuggestions ca-
                 pacity is 2.5 calls per second (higher than  five  times  0.2
                 queries per second).
