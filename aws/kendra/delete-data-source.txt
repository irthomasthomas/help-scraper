NAME
       delete-data-source -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an Amazon Kendra data source. An exception is not thrown if the
       data source is already being deleted. While the data  source  is  being
       deleted,  the Status field returned by a call to the DescribeDataSource
       API is set to DELETING  .  For  more  information,  see  Deleting  Data
       Sources .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-data-source
          --id <value>
          --index-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The identifier of the data source you want to delete.

       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index used with the data source.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
