OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index you want to get query suggestions from.

       --query-text (string)
          The text of a user's query to generate query suggestions.

          A query is suggested if the query prefix matches what a user  starts
          to type as their query.

          Amazon  Kendra  does  not show any suggestions if a user types fewer
          than two characters or more than 60 characters. A  query  must  also
          have  at  least  one  search result and contain at least one word of
          more than four characters.

       --max-suggestions-count (integer)
          The maximum number of query suggestions you want  to  show  to  your
          users.

       --suggestion-types (list)
          The  suggestions  type  to base query suggestions on. The suggestion
          types are query history or document fields/attributes. You  can  set
          one type or the other.

          If  you  set  query  history as your suggestions type, Amazon Kendra
          suggests queries relevant to your users based on popular queries  in
          the query history.

          If you set document fields/attributes as your suggestions type, Ama-
          zon Kendra suggests queries relevant to your users based on the con-
          tents of document fields.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            QUERY
            DOCUMENT_ATTRIBUTES

       --attribute-suggestions-config (structure)
          Configuration  information  for  the document fields/attributes that
          you want to base query suggestions on.

          SuggestionAttributes -> (list)
              The list of document field/attribute keys or field names to  use
              for  query  suggestions. If the content within any of the fields
              match what your user starts typing  as  their  query,  then  the
              field content is returned as a query suggestion.

              (string)

          AdditionalResponseAttributes -> (list)
              The  list  of  additional document field/attribute keys or field
              names to include in the response. You can use additional  fields
              to  provide extra information in the response. Additional fields
              are not used to based suggestions on.

              (string)

          AttributeFilter -> (structure)
              Filters the search results based on document fields/attributes.

              AndAllFilters -> (list)
                 Performs a logical AND operation  on  all  filters  that  you
                 specify.

                 (structure)
                     Filters  the  search results based on document attributes
                     or fields.

                     You can filter results using attributes for your particu-
                     lar  documents.  The attributes must exist in your index.
                     For example, if your documents include the custom  attri-
                     bute  "Department",  you can filter documents that belong
                     to the "HR" department. You would use the EqualsTo opera-
                     tion  to  filter  results  or documents with "Department"
                     equals to "HR".

                     You can use AndAllFilters and AndOrFilters in combination
                     with each other or with other operations such as EqualsTo
                     . For example:
                        AndAllFilters

                     o EqualsTo : "Department", "HR"

                     o AndOrFilters

                       o ContainsAny : "Project Name", ["new hires", "new hir-
                         ing"]

                     This  example filters results or documents that belong to
                     the HR department and belong  to  projects  that  contain
                     "new hires" or "new hiring" in the project name (must use
                     ContainAny with StringListValue ). This example  is  fil-
                     tering with a depth of 2.

                     You  cannot  filter more than a depth of 2, otherwise you
                     receive a ValidationException exception with the  message
                     "AttributeFilter  cannot  have  a  depth of more than 2."
                     Also, if you use more than  10  attribute  filters  in  a
                     given  list  for  AndAllFilters or OrAllFilters , you re-
                     ceive a ValidationException with the message  "Attribute-
                     Filter cannot have a length of more than 10".

                     For  examples  of using AttributeFilter , see Using docu-
                     ment attributes to filter search results .

                     AndAllFilters -> (list)
                        Performs a logical AND operation on all  filters  that
                        you specify.

                        ( ... recursive ... )

                     OrAllFilters -> (list)
                        Performs  a  logical  OR operation on all filters that
                        you specify.

                               A  list  of strings. The default maximum length
                               or number of strings is 10.

                               (string)

                            LongValue -> (long)

                               Time.

              OrAllFilters -> (list)
                 Performs a logical OR operation on all filters that you spec-
                 ify.

                 (structure)
                     Filters the search results based on  document  attributes
                     or fields.

                     You can filter results using attributes for your particu-
                     lar documents. The attributes must exist in  your  index.
                     For  example, if your documents include the custom attri-
                     bute "Department", you can filter documents  that  belong
                     to the "HR" department. You would use the EqualsTo opera-
                     tion to filter results  or  documents  with  "Department"
                     equals to "HR".

                     You can use AndAllFilters and AndOrFilters in combination
                     with each other or with other operations such as EqualsTo
                     . For example:
                        AndAllFilters

                     o EqualsTo : "Department", "HR"

                     o AndOrFilters

                       o ContainsAny : "Project Name", ["new hires", "new hir-
                         ing"]

                     This example filters results or documents that belong  to
                     the  HR  department  and  belong to projects that contain
                     "new hires" or "new hiring" in the project name (must use
                     ContainAny  with  StringListValue ). This example is fil-
                     tering with a depth of 2.

                     You cannot filter more than a depth of 2,  otherwise  you
                     receive  a ValidationException exception with the message
                     "AttributeFilter cannot have a depth  of  more  than  2."
                     Also,  if  you  use  more  than 10 attribute filters in a
                     given list for AndAllFilters or OrAllFilters  ,  you  re-
                     ceive  a ValidationException with the message "Attribute-
                     Filter cannot have a length of more than 10".

                     For examples of using AttributeFilter , see  Using  docu-
                     ment attributes to filter search results .

                     AndAllFilters -> (list)
                        Performs  a  logical AND operation on all filters that
                        you specify.

                     OrAllFilters -> (list)
                        Performs a logical OR operation on  all  filters  that
                        you specify.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
