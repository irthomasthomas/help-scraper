OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index you want to get query suggestions from.

       --query-text (string)
          The text of a user's query to generate query suggestions.

          A query is suggested if the query prefix matches what a user  starts
          to type as their query.

          Amazon  Kendra  does  not show any suggestions if a user types fewer
          than two characters or more than 60 characters. A  query  must  also
          have  at  least  one  search result and contain at least one word of
          more than four characters.

       --max-suggestions-count (integer)
          The maximum number of query suggestions you want  to  show  to  your
          users.

       --suggestion-types (list)
          The  suggestions  type  to base query suggestions on. The suggestion
          types are query history or document fields/attributes. You  can  set
          one type or the other.

          If  you  set  query  history as your suggestions type, Amazon Kendra
          suggests queries relevant to your users based on popular queries  in
          the query history.

          If you set document fields/attributes as your suggestions type, Ama-
          zon Kendra suggests queries relevant to your users based on the con-
          tents of document fields.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            QUERY
            DOCUMENT_ATTRIBUTES

       --attribute-suggestions-config (structure)
          Configuration  information  for  the document fields/attributes that
          you want to base query suggestions on.

          SuggestionAttributes -> (list)
              The list of document field/attribute keys or field names to  use
              for  query  suggestions. If the content within any of the fields
              match what your user starts typing  as  their  query,  then  the
              field content is returned as a query suggestion.

              (string)

          AdditionalResponseAttributes -> (list)
              The  list  of  additional document field/attribute keys or field
              names to include in the response. You can use additional  fields
              to  provide extra information in the response. Additional fields
              are not used to based suggestions on.

              (string)

          AttributeFilter -> (structure)
              Filters the search results based on document fields/attributes.

              AndAllFilters -> (list)
                 Performs a logical AND operation on all supplied filters.

                 (structure)
                     Provides filtering the query results  based  on  document
                     attributes or metadata fields.

                     When  you use the AndAllFilters or OrAllFilters , filters
                     you can use 2 layers under the  first  attribute  filter.
                     For example, you can use:
                        <AndAllFilters>

                     o <OrAllFilters>

                     o <EqualsTo>

                     If  you  use  more  than  2 layers, you receive a Valida-
                     tionException exception with the message "AttributeFilter
                     cannot have a depth of more than 2."

                     If you use more than 10 attribute filters in a given list
                     for AndAllFilters or OrAllFilters , you receive a Valida-
                     tionException  with  the  message "AttributeFilter cannot
                     have a length of more than 10".

                     AndAllFilters -> (list)
                        Performs a logical AND operation on all supplied  fil-
                        ters.

                        ( ... recursive ... )

                     OrAllFilters -> (list)
                        Performs  a  logical OR operation on all supplied fil-
                        ters.

                        ( ... recursive ... )

                     ( ... recursive ... )EqualsTo -> (structure)
                        Performs an  equals  operation  on  two  document  at-

                               It is important for the time  zone  to  be  in-
                               cluded  in  the  ISO 8601 date-time format. For
                               example, 2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00 is  the  ISO

                               12:30PM (plus 10 seconds) in  Central  European

                 (structure)
                     Provides  filtering  the  query results based on document
                     attributes or metadata fields.

                     When you use the AndAllFilters or OrAllFilters ,  filters
                     you  can  use  2 layers under the first attribute filter.
                     For example, you can use:
                        <AndAllFilters>

                     o <OrAllFilters>

                     o <EqualsTo>

                     If you use more than 2  layers,  you  receive  a  Valida-
                     tionException exception with the message "AttributeFilter
                     cannot have a depth of more than 2."

                     If you use more than 10 attribute filters in a given list
                     for AndAllFilters or OrAllFilters , you receive a Valida-
                     tionException with the  message  "AttributeFilter  cannot
                     have a length of more than 10".

                     AndAllFilters -> (list)

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
