OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index you want to get query suggestions from.

       --query-text (string)
          The text of a user's query to generate query suggestions.

          A query is suggested if the query prefix matches what a user  starts
          to type as their query.

          Amazon  Kendra  does  not show any suggestions if a user types fewer
          than two characters or more than 60 characters. A  query  must  also
          have  at  least  one  search result and contain at least one word of
          more than four characters.

       --max-suggestions-count (integer)
          The maximum number of query suggestions you want  to  show  to  your
          users.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
