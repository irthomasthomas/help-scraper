NAME
       update-query-suggestions-block-list -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates a block list used for query suggestions for an index.

       Updates to a block list might not take effect right away. Amazon Kendra
       needs to refresh the entire suggestions list to apply  any  updates  to
       the block list. Other changes not related to the block list apply imme-
       diately.

       If a block list is updating, then you need to wait for the first update
       to finish before submitting another update.

       Amazon Kendra supports partial updates, so you only need to provide the
       fields you want to update.
          UpdateQuerySuggestionsBlockList is currently not  supported  in  the
          Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US-West) region.

SYNOPSIS
            update-query-suggestions-block-list
          --index-id <value>
          --id <value>
          [--name <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          [--source-s3-path <value>]
          [--role-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index for the block list.

       --id (string)
          The identifier of the block list you want to update.

       --name (string)
          A new name for the block list.

       --description (string)
          A new description for the block list.

       --source-s3-path (structure)
          The S3 path where your block list text file sits in S3.

          If you update your block list and provide the same path to the block
          list text file in S3, then Amazon Kendra reloads the file to refresh
          the  block  list.  Amazon Kendra does not automatically refresh your
          block list. You need to call the UpdateQuerySuggestionsBlockList API
          to refresh you block list.

          If you update your block list, then Amazon Kendra asynchronously re-
          freshes all query suggestions with the  latest  content  in  the  S3
          file. This means changes might not take effect immediately.

          Bucket -> (string)
              The name of the S3 bucket that contains the file.

          Key -> (string)
              The name of the file.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Bucket=string,Key=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Bucket": "string",
            "Key": "string"
          }

       --role-arn (string)
          The  IAM  (Identity  and  Access Management) role used to access the
          block list text file in S3.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
