NAME
       update-featured-results-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  a  set  of featured results. Features results are placed above
       all other results for certain queries. You map specific queries to spe-
       cific  documents  for  featuring in the results. If a query contains an
       exact match of a query, then one or more specific  documents  are  fea-
       tured in the search results.

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index used for featuring results.

       --featured-results-set-id (string)
          The  identifier  of the set of featured results that you want to up-
          date.

       --featured-results-set-name (string)
          A new name for the set of featured results.

       --description (string)
          A new description for the set of featured results.

       --status (string)
          You can set the status to ACTIVE or INACTIVE . When the value is AC-
          TIVE  ,  featured results are ready for use. You can still configure
          your settings before setting the status to ACTIVE . The queries  you
          specify for featured results must be unique per featured results set
          for each index, whether the status is ACTIVE or INACTIVE .

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o INACTIVE

       --query-texts (list)
          A list of queries for featuring results. For more information on the
          list of queries, see FeaturedResultsSet .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --featured-documents (list)
          A  list of document IDs for the documents you want to feature at the
          top of the search results page. For more information on the list  of
          featured documents, see FeaturedResultsSet .

          (structure)
              A  featured  document.  This document is displayed at the top of
              the search results page, placed above all other results for cer-
              tain  queries.  If  there's  an exact match of a query, then the
              document is featured in the search results.

              Id -> (string)
                 The identifier of the document to feature in the  search  re-
                 sults. You can use the Query API to search for specific docu-
                 ments with their document IDs included in the  result  items,
                 or you can use the console.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Id=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       FeaturedResultsSet -> (structure)
          Information  on the set of featured results. This includes the iden-
          tifier of the featured results set, whether the featured results set
          is  active  or  inactive, when the featured results set was last up-
          dated, and more.

          FeaturedResultsSetId -> (string)
              The identifier of the set of featured results.

          FeaturedResultsSetName -> (string)
              The name for the set of featured results.

          Description -> (string)
              The description for the set of featured results.

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of the set  of  featured  results.  When  the
              value  is  ACTIVE  , featured results are ready for use. You can
              still configure your settings before setting the status  to  AC-
              TIVE  .  You  can set the status to ACTIVE or INACTIVE using the
              UpdateFeaturedResultsSet API. The queries you specify  for  fea-
              tured  results  must be unique per featured results set for each
              index, whether the status is ACTIVE or INACTIVE .

          QueryTexts -> (list)
              The list of queries for featuring results.

              Specific queries are mapped to specific documents for  featuring
              in  the results. If a query contains an exact match, then one or
              more specific documents are featured in the results.  The  exact
              match  applies to the full query. For example, if you only spec-
              ify 'Kendra', queries such as 'How does kendra semantically rank
              results?' will not render the featured results. Featured results
              are designed for specific queries, rather than queries that  are
              too broad in scope.

              (string)

          FeaturedDocuments -> (list)
              The  list  of document IDs for the documents you want to feature
              at the top of the search results page. You can use the Query API
              to  search  for  specific  documents with their document IDs in-
              cluded in the result items, or you can use the console.

              You can add up to four featured documents. You  can  request  to
              increase this limit by contacting Support .

              Specific  queries are mapped to specific documents for featuring
              in the results. If a query contains an exact match, then one  or
              more  specific  documents are featured in the results. The exact
              match applies to the full query. For example, if you only  spec-
              ify 'Kendra', queries such as 'How does kendra semantically rank
              results?' will not render the featured results. Featured results
              are  designed for specific queries, rather than queries that are
              too broad in scope.

              (structure)
                 A featured document. This document is displayed at the top of
                 the  search  results page, placed above all other results for
                 certain queries. If there's an exact match of a  query,  then
                 the document is featured in the search results.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The  identifier  of the document to feature in the search
                     results. You can use the Query API to search for specific
                     documents  with their document IDs included in the result
                     items, or you can use the console.

          LastUpdatedTimestamp -> (long)
              The Unix timestamp when the set of featured results was last up-
              dated.

          CreationTimestamp -> (long)
              The Unix timestamp when the set of featured results was created.
