DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an access control configuration that you created for your docu-
       ments in an index. This includes user and group access information  for
       your documents. This is useful for user context filtering, where search
       results are filtered based on the user or their group access  to  docu-
       ments.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-access-control-configuration
          --index-id <value>
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index for an access control configuration.

       --id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  access  control  configuration you want to
          delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
