BATCH-DELETE-DOCUMENT()                                BATCH-DELETE-DOCUMENT()



NAME
       batch-delete-document -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  one  or  more documents from an index. The documents must have
       been added with the BatchPutDocument API.

       The documents are deleted asynchronously. You can see the  progress  of
       the  deletion  by  using Amazon Web Services CloudWatch. Any error mes-
       sages related to the processing of the batch are sent  to  your  Amazon
       Web  Services CloudWatch log. You can also use the BatchGetDocumentSta-
       tus API to monitor the progress of deleting your documents.

       Deleting documents from an index using BatchDeleteDocument  could  take
       up to an hour or more, depending on the number of documents you want to
       delete.

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index that contains the documents to delete.

       --document-id-list (list)
          One or more identifiers for documents to delete from the index.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --data-source-sync-job-metric-target (structure)
          Maps a particular data source sync job to a particular data source.

          DataSourceId -> (string)
              The ID of the data source that is running the sync job.

          DataSourceSyncJobId -> (string)
              The ID of the sync job that is running on the data source.

              If the ID of a sync job is not provided and there is a sync  job
              running,  then  the  ID of this sync job is used and metrics are
              generated for this sync job.

              If the ID of a sync job is not provided and there is no sync job
              running,  then  no  metrics  are generated and documents are in-
              dexed/deleted at the index level without sync  job  metrics  in-
              cluded.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DataSourceId=string,DataSourceSyncJobId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DataSourceId": "string",
            "DataSourceSyncJobId": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.
