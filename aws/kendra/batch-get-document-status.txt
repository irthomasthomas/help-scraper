BATCH-GET-DOCUMENT-STATUS()                        BATCH-GET-DOCUMENT-STATUS()



NAME
       batch-get-document-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  indexing  status for one or more documents submitted with
       the BatchPutDocument API.

       When you use the BatchPutDocument  API,  documents  are  indexed  asyn-
       chronously.  You can use the BatchGetDocumentStatus API to get the cur-
       rent status of a list of documents so that you can  determine  if  they
       have been successfully indexed.

       You  can also use the BatchGetDocumentStatus API to check the status of
       the BatchDeleteDocument API. When a document is deleted from the index,
       Amazon Kendra returns NOT_FOUND as the status.

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index to add documents to. The index ID is re-
          turned by the CreateIndex API.

       --document-info-list (list)
          A list of DocumentInfo objects that identify the documents for which
          to  get  the status. You identify the documents by their document ID
          and optional attributes.

          (structure)
              Identifies a document for which to retrieve status information

              DocumentId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the document.

              Attributes -> (list)
                 Attributes that identify a specific version of a document  to
                 check.

                 The only valid attributes are:

                 o version

                 o datasourceId

                 o jobExecutionId

                 The attributes follow these rules:

                 o dataSourceId and jobExecutionId must be used together.

                 o version  is  ignored if dataSourceId and jobExecutionId are
                   not provided.

                 o If dataSourceId and jobExecutionId are provided,  but  ver-
                   sion is not, the version defaults to "0".

                 (structure)
                     A  document attribute or metadata field. To create custom
                     document attributes, see Custom attributes .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The identifier for the attribute.

                     Value -> (structure)
                        The value of the attribute.

                        StringValue -> (string)
                            A string, such as "department".

                        StringListValue -> (list)
                            A list of strings. The default maximum  length  or
                            number of strings is 10.

                            (string)

                        LongValue -> (long)

                        DateValue -> (timestamp)
                            A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                            It  is  important for the time zone to be included
                            in the ISO 8601  date-time  format.  For  example,
                            2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00    is   the   ISO   8601
                            date-time format for March 25th  2012  at  12:30PM
                            (plus 10 seconds) in Central European Time.

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "DocumentId": "string",
              "Attributes": [
                {
                  "Key": "string",
                  "Value": {
                    "StringValue": "string",
                    "StringListValue": ["string", ...],
                    "LongValue": long,
                    "DateValue": timestamp
                  }
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Errors -> (list)
          A  list of documents that Amazon Kendra couldn't get the status for.
          The list includes the ID of the document and  the  reason  that  the
          status couldn't be found.

          (structure)
              Provides  a  response when the status of a document could not be
              retrieved.

              DocumentId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the document whose status could not be  re-
                 trieved.

              DataSourceId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of the data source connector that the failed
                 document belongs to.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 Indicates the source of the error.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 States that the API could not get the status of  a  document.
                 This  could be because the request is not valid or there is a
                 system error.

       DocumentStatusList -> (list)
          The status of documents. The status indicates  if  the  document  is
          waiting  to be indexed, is in the process of indexing, has completed
          indexing, or failed indexing. If a  document  failed  indexing,  the
          status provides the reason why.

          (structure)
              Provides information about the status of documents submitted for
              indexing.

              DocumentId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the document.

              DocumentStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of a document.

                 If the document was submitted for  deletion,  the  status  is
                 NOT_FOUND after the document is deleted.

              FailureCode -> (string)
                 Indicates the source of the error.

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 Provides detailed information about why the document couldn't
                 be indexed. Use this information to correct the error  before
                 you resubmit the document for indexing.
