OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The index that contains the FAQ lists.

       --next-token (string)
          If  the previous response was incomplete (because there is more data
          to retrieve), Amazon Kendra returns a pagination token  in  the  re-
          sponse.  You  can use this pagination token to retrieve the next set
          of FAQs.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of FAQs to return in the response. If  there  are
          fewer  results  in  the list, this response contains only the actual
          results.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon Kendra returns this token  that
          you  can  use  in the subsequent request to retrieve the next set of
          FAQs.

       FaqSummaryItems -> (list)
          information about the FAQs associated with the specified index.

          (structure)

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of the FAQ. When the status is ACTIVE  the
                 FAQ is ready for use.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix timestamp when the FAQ was created.

              UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
