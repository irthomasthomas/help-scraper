CREATE-FEATURED-RESULTS-SET()                    CREATE-FEATURED-RESULTS-SET()



NAME
       create-featured-results-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  set of featured results to display at the top of the search
       results page. Featured results are placed above all other  results  for
       certain  queries.  You  map  specific queries to specific documents for
       featuring in the results. If a query contains an exact match, then  one
       or more specific documents are featured in the search results.

       You can create up to 50 sets of featured results per index. You can re-
       quest to increase this limit by contacting Support .

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index that you want to use for  featuring  re-
          sults.

       --featured-results-set-name (string)
          A name for the set of featured results.

       --description (string)
          A description for the set of featured results.

       --client-token (string)
          A  token that you provide to identify the request to create a set of
          featured results. Multiple calls to the CreateFeaturedResultsSet API
          with  the  same  client  token will create only one featured results
          set.

       --status (string)
          The current status of the set of featured results. When the value is
          ACTIVE , featured results are ready for use. You can still configure
          your settings before setting the status to ACTIVE . You can set  the
          status to ACTIVE or INACTIVE using the UpdateFeaturedResultsSet API.
          The queries you specify for featured results must be unique per fea-
          tured  results  set  for each index, whether the status is ACTIVE or
          INACTIVE .

              the search results page, placed above all other results for cer-
              tain  queries.  If  there's  an exact match of a query, then the

              Id -> (string)
                 The identifier of the document to feature in the  search  re-

                 ments with their document IDs included in the  result  items,
                 or you can use the console.

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of key-value pairs that identify or categorize the featured
          results set. You can also use tags to help  control  access  to  the
          featured  results  set.  Tag  keys and values can consist of Unicode
          letters, digits, white space, and any of the following symbols:_ . :
          / = + - @.

          (structure)
              A  list  of key/value pairs that identify an index, FAQ, or data
              source. Tag keys and values can consist of Unicode letters, dig-
              its,  white space, and any of the following symbols: _ . : / = +
              - @.

              Key -> (string)

                 unique for the index, FAQ, or data source.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value associated with the tag. The value may be an empty
                 string but it can't be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       FeaturedResultsSet -> (structure)
          Information on the set of featured results. This includes the  iden-
          tifier of the featured results set, whether the featured results set
          is active or inactive, when the featured results  set  was  created,
          and more.

          FeaturedResultsSetId -> (string)
              The identifier of the set of featured results.

          FeaturedResultsSetName -> (string)
              The name for the set of featured results.

          Description -> (string)
              The description for the set of featured results.

          Status -> (string)
              The  current  status  of  the  set of featured results. When the
              value is ACTIVE , featured results are ready for  use.  You  can
              still  configure  your settings before setting the status to AC-
              TIVE . You can set the status to ACTIVE or  INACTIVE  using  the
              UpdateFeaturedResultsSet  API.  The queries you specify for fea-
              tured results must be unique per featured results set  for  each
              index, whether the status is ACTIVE or INACTIVE .

          QueryTexts -> (list)
              The list of queries for featuring results.

              Specific  queries are mapped to specific documents for featuring
              in the results. If a query contains an exact match, then one  or
              more  specific  documents are featured in the results. The exact
              match applies to the full query. For example, if you only  spec-
              ify 'Kendra', queries such as 'How does kendra semantically rank
              results?' will not render the featured results. Featured results
              are  designed for specific queries, rather than queries that are
              too broad in scope.

              (string)

          FeaturedDocuments -> (list)
              The list of document IDs for the documents you want  to  feature
              at the top of the search results page. You can use the Query API
              to search for specific documents with  their  document  IDs  in-
              cluded in the result items, or you can use the console.

              You  can  add  up to four featured documents. You can request to
              increase this limit by contacting Support .

              Specific queries are mapped to specific documents for  featuring
              in  the results. If a query contains an exact match, then one or
              more specific documents are featured in the results.  The  exact
              match  applies to the full query. For example, if you only spec-
              ify 'Kendra', queries such as 'How does kendra semantically rank
              results?' will not render the featured results. Featured results
              are designed for specific queries, rather than queries that  are
              too broad in scope.

              (structure)
                 A featured document. This document is displayed at the top of
                 the search results page, placed above all other  results  for
                 certain  queries.  If there's an exact match of a query, then
                 the document is featured in the search results.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The identifier of the document to feature in  the  search
                     results. You can use the Query API to search for specific
                     documents with their document IDs included in the  result
                     items, or you can use the console.

          LastUpdatedTimestamp -> (long)
              The Unix timestamp when the set of featured results was last up-
              dated.

          CreationTimestamp -> (long)
              The Unix timestamp when the set of featured results was created.
