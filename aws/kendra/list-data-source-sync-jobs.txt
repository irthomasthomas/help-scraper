OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The identifier of the data source connector.

       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index used with the data source connector.

       --next-token (string)
          If  the previous response was incomplete (because there is more data
          to retrieve), Amazon Kendra returns a pagination token  in  the  re-
          sponse.  You  can use this pagination token to retrieve the next set
          of jobs.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of synchronization jobs  to  return  in  the  re-
          sponse.  If  there are fewer results in the list, this response con-
          tains only the actual results.

       --start-time-filter (structure)
          When specified, the synchronization jobs returned in  the  list  are
          limited to jobs between the specified dates.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The UNIX datetime of the beginning of the time range.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The UNIX datetime of the end of the time range.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          StartTime=timestamp,EndTime=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "StartTime": timestamp,
            "EndTime": timestamp
          }

       --status-filter (string)
          Only returns synchronization jobs with the Status field equal to the
          specified status.

          Possible values:

          o FAILED

          o SUCCEEDED

          o SYNCING

          o INCOMPLETE

          o STOPPING

          o ABORTED

          o SYNCING_INDEXING

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       History -> (list)
          A history of synchronization jobs for the data source connector.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a data source synchronization job.

              ExecutionId -> (string)
                 A identifier for the synchronization job.

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The UNIX datetime that the synchronization job started.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The UNIX datetime that the synchronization job completed.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  execution  status  of  the synchronization job. When the
                 Status field is set to SUCCEEDED , the synchronization job is
                 done. If the status code is set to FAILED , the ErrorCode and
                 ErrorMessage fields give you the reason for the failure.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 If the Status field is set to ERROR , the ErrorMessage  field
                 contains  a description of the error that caused the synchro-
                 nization to fail.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 If the Status field is set to FAILED ,  the  ErrorCode  field
                 indicates the reason the synchronization failed.

              DataSourceErrorCode -> (string)
                 If  the  reason  that the synchronization failed is due to an
                 error with the underlying data source, this field contains  a
                 code that identifies the error.

              Metrics -> (structure)
                 Maps  a  batch  delete  document  request  to a specific data
                 source sync job. This is optional and should only be supplied
                 when documents are deleted by a data source connector.

                 DocumentsAdded -> (string)
                     The  number of documents added from the data source up to
                     now in the data source sync.

                 DocumentsModified -> (string)
                     The number of documents modified in the data source up to
                     now in the data source sync run.

                 DocumentsDeleted -> (string)
                     The  number  of documents deleted from the data source up
                     to now in the data source sync run.

                 DocumentsFailed -> (string)
                     The number of documents that failed to sync from the data
                     source up to now in the data source sync run.

                 DocumentsScanned -> (string)
                     The  current  number  of documents crawled by the current
                     sync job in the data source.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon Kendra returns this token  that
          you  can  use  in the subsequent request to retrieve the next set of
          jobs.
