CREATE-ACCESS-CONTROL-CONFIGURATION()    CREATE-ACCESS-CONTROL-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       create-access-control-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an access configuration for your documents. This includes user
       and group access information for your documents.  This  is  useful  for
       user  context filtering, where search results are filtered based on the
       user or their group access to documents.

       You can use this to re-configure your existing  document  level  access
       control without indexing all of your documents again. For example, your
       index contains top-secret company documents that only certain employees
       or  users  should  access.  One  of  these  users leaves the company or
       switches to a team that should be  blocked  from  accessing  top-secret
       documents.  The  user  still has access to top-secret documents because
       the user had access when your documents were  previously  indexed.  You
       can  create  a  specific access control configuration for the user with
       deny access. You can later update the access control  configuration  to
       allow  access  if  the  user  returns  to  the company and re-joins the
       'top-secret' team. You can re-configure access control for  your  docu-
       ments as circumstances change.

       To  apply  your  access control configuration to certain documents, you
       call the BatchPutDocument API with the AccessControlConfigurationId in-
       cluded  in  the  Document  object.  If  you  use an S3 bucket as a data
       source, you update the .metadata.json with the  AccessControlConfigura-
       tionId  and  synchronize your data source. Amazon Kendra currently only
       supports access control configuration for S3 data sources and documents
       indexed using the BatchPutDocument API.

       --access-control-list (list)
          Information on principals (users and/or groups) and which  documents
          they  should have access to. This is useful for user context filter-
          ing, where search results are filtered based on the  user  or  their
          group access to documents.

          (structure)
              Provides user and group information for user context filtering .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the user or group.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of principal.

              Access -> (string)
                 Whether to allow or deny document access to the principal.

              DataSourceId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the data source the principal should access
                 documents from.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Type=string,Access=string,DataSourceId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Type": "USER"|"GROUP",
              "Access": "ALLOW"|"DENY",
              "DataSourceId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --hierarchical-access-control-list (list)
          The list of principal lists that define the hierarchy for which doc-
          uments users should have access to.

          (structure)
              Information  to  define  the hierarchy for which documents users
              should have access to.

              PrincipalList -> (list)
                 A list of principal lists that define the hierarchy for which
                 documents users should have access to. Each hierarchical list
                 specifies which user or group has allow or  deny  access  for
                 each document.

                 (structure)
                     Provides user and group information for user context fil-
                     tering .

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "PrincipalList": [
                {
                  "Name": "string",

          ]

       --client-token (string)
          A token that you provide to identify the request to create an access
          control configuration. Multiple calls to the CreateAccessControlCon-
          figuration API with the same client token will create only  one  ac-
          cess control configuration.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Id -> (string)
          The identifier of the access control configuration  for  your  docu-
          ments in an index.
