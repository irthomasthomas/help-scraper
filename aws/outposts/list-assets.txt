LIST-ASSETS()                                                    LIST-ASSETS()



NAME
       list-assets -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  hardware  assets  in an Outpost. If you are using Dedicated
       Hosts on Amazon Web Services Outposts, you can filter your  request  by
       host ID to return a list of hardware assets that allocate resources for
       Dedicated Hosts.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-assets
          --outpost-identifier <value>
          [--host-id-filter <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --outpost-identifier (string)
          The ID or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost.

       --host-id-filter (list)
          A filter for the host ID of Dedicated Hosts on the Outpost.

          Filter values are case sensitive. If you specify multiple values for
          a filter, the values are joined with an OR , and the request returns
          all results that match any of the specified values.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum page size.

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
