LIST-ASSETS()                                                    LIST-ASSETS()



NAME
       list-assets -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the hardware assets for the specified Outpost.

       Use  filters  to  return specific results. If you specify multiple fil-
       ters, the results include only the resources  that  match  all  of  the
       specified  filters. For a filter where you can specify multiple values,
       the results include items that match any of the values that you specify
       for the filter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-assets  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Assets

OPTIONS
       --outpost-identifier (string)
          The ID or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost.

       --host-id-filter (list)
          Filters the results by the host ID of a Dedicated Host.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --status-filter (list)
          Filters the results by state.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            ACTIVE
            RETIRING
            ISOLATED

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Assets -> (list)
          Information about the hardware assets.

          (structure)
              Information about hardware assets.

              AssetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the asset.

              RackId -> (string)
                 The rack ID of the asset.

              AssetType -> (string)
                 The type of the asset.

              ComputeAttributes -> (structure)
                 Information about compute hardware assets.

                 HostId -> (string)
                     The host ID of the Dedicated Host on the asset.

                 State -> (string)
                     The state.

                     o ACTIVE - The asset is available and can provide  capac-
                       ity for new compute resources.

                     o ISOLATED  -  The  asset  is  undergoing maintenance and
                       can't provide capacity for new compute  resources.  Ex-
                       isting compute resources on the asset are not affected.

                     o RETIRING - The underlying hardware for the asset is de-
                       graded. Capacity for new compute resources is  reduced.
                       Amazon  Web  Services sends notifications for resources
                       that must be stopped before the asset can be replaced.

                 InstanceFamilies -> (list)
                     A list of the names of instance families  that  are  cur-
                     rently associated with a given asset.

                     (string)

              AssetLocation -> (structure)
                 The position of an asset in a rack.

                 RackElevation -> (float)
                     The  position  of  an  asset  in  a rack measured in rack
                     units.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token.
