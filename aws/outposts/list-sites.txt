LIST-SITES()                                                      LIST-SITES()



NAME
       list-sites -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the Outpost sites for your Amazon Web Services account. Add oper-
       ating address filters to your request to return a more specific list of
       results.  Use filters to match site city, country code, or state/region
       of the operating address.

       If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an  AND  ,
       and  the  request  returns only results that match all of the specified
       filters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-sites
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--operating-address-country-code-filter <value>]
          [--operating-address-state-or-region-filter <value>]
          [--operating-address-city-filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum page size.

       --operating-address-country-code-filter (list)
          A filter for the country code of the Outpost site.

          Filter values are case sensitive. If you specify multiple values for
          a filter, the values are joined with an OR , and the request returns
          all results that match any of the specified values.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --operating-address-state-or-region-filter (list)
          A filter for the state/region of the Outpost site.

          Filter values are case sensitive. If you specify multiple values for
          a filter, the values are joined with an OR , and the request returns
          all results that match any of the specified values.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --operating-address-city-filter (list)
          A filter for the city of the Outpost site.

          Filter values are case sensitive. If you specify multiple values for
          a filter, the values are joined with an OR , and the request returns
          all results that match any of the specified values.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
