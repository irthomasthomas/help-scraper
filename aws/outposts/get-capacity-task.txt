OPTIONS
       --capacity-task-id (string)
          ID of the capacity task.

       --outpost-identifier (string)
          ID  or  ARN  of  the  Outpost associated with the specified capacity
          task.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       OrderId -> (string)
          ID  of  the  Amazon  Web Services Outposts order associated with the
          specified capacity task.

          List of instance pools requested in the capacity task.

          (structure)
              The instance type that you specify determines the combination of
              CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.

       DryRun -> (boolean)

            celled.

          o WAITING_FOR_EVACUATION - The capacity task  requires  capacity  to
            run.  You  must stop the recommended EC2 running instances to free
            up capacity for the task to run.
