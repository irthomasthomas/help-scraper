GET-SITE()                                                          GET-SITE()



NAME
       get-site -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about the specified Outpost site.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-site
          --site-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --site-id (string)
          The ID or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the site.

          NOTE:
              In requests, Amazon Web Services Outposts accepts the Amazon Re-
              source Name (ARN) or an ID for Outposts and sites throughout the
              Outposts  Query API. To address backwards compatibility, the pa-
              rameter names OutpostID or SiteID remain in use. Despite the pa-
              rameter name, you can make the request with an ARN.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
