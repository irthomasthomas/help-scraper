OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  domain that you want to get detailed information
          about.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get detailed information about a specified domain

       The  following  get-domain-detail command displays detailed information
       about the specified domain.

       This command runs only in the us-east-1 Region. If your default  region
       is set to us-east-1, you can omit the region parameter.

          aws route53domains get-domain-detail \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --domain-name example.com

       StatusList -> (list)
          An  array of domain name status codes, also known as Extensible Pro-
          visioning Protocol (EPP) status codes.

          ICANN, the organization that maintains a central database of  domain
          names, has developed a set of domain name status codes that tell you
          the status of a variety of operations on a domain name, for example,
          registering  a  domain  name,  transferring a domain name to another
          registrar, renewing the registration for a domain name, and  so  on.
          All registrars use this same set of status codes.

          For a current list of domain name status codes and an explanation of
          what each code means, go to the ICANN website  and  search  for  epp
          status  codes . (Search on the ICANN website; web searches sometimes
          return an old version of the document.)

          (string)

       DnssecKeys -> (list)
          A complex type that contains information about the DNSSEC configura-
          tion.

          (structure)
              Information about the DNSSEC key.

              You get this from your DNS provider and then give it to Route 53
              (by using AssociateDelegationSignerToDomain ) to pass it to  the
              registry to establish the chain of trust.

              Algorithm -> (integer)
                 The number of the public keys cryptographic algorithm accord-
                 ing to an IANA assignment.

                 If Route 53 is your DNS service, set this to 13.

                 For more  information  about  enabling  DNSSEC  signing,  see
                 Enabling DNSSEC signing and establishing a chain of trust .

              Flags -> (integer)
                 Defines  the  type  of key. It can be either a KSK (key-sign-
                 ing-key, value 257) or ZSK (zone-signing-key, value 256). Us-
                 ing  KSK  is  always  encouraged.  Only  use  ZSK if your DNS
                 provider isn't Route 53 and you dont have KSK available.

                 If you have KSK and ZSK keys, always use KSK to create a del-
                 egations  signer  (DS) record. If you have ZSK keys only  use
                 ZSK to create a DS record.

              PublicKey -> (string)
                 The base64-encoded public key part of the key  pair  that  is
                 passed to the registry .

              DigestType -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  the DS digest algorithm according to an IANA
                 assignment.

                 For more information, see IANA for DNSSEC  Delegation  Signer
                 (DS) Resource Record (RR) Type Digest Algorithms.

              Digest -> (string)
                 The delegation signer digest.

                 Digest is calculated from the public key provided using spec-
                 ified digest algorithm and this digest is  the  actual  value
                 returned  from  the  registry  nameservers as the value of DS
                 records.

              KeyTag -> (integer)
                 A numeric identification of the DNSKEY record referred to  by
                 this DS record.

              Id -> (string)
                 An    ID    assigned   to   each   DS   record   created   by

                ify a value for OrganizationName .

              o For some TLDs, the privacy protection available depends on the
                value that you specify for Contact Type . For the privacy pro-
                tection settings for your TLD, see Domains that You Can Regis-
