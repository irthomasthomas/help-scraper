LIST-OPERATIONS()                                            LIST-OPERATIONS()



NAME
       list-operations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about all of the operations that return an opera-
       tion ID and that have ever been performed on domains that  were  regis-
       tered by the current account.

       This command runs only in the us-east-1 Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-operations is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Operations

OPTIONS
       --submitted-since (timestamp)
          An optional parameter that lets you get information  about  all  the
          operations that you submitted after a specified date and time. Spec-
          ify the date and time in Unix time format and Coordinated  Universal
          time (UTC).

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --status (list)
          The status of the operations.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            SUBMITTED
            IN_PROGRESS
            ERROR
            SUCCESSFUL
            FAILED

       --type (list)
          An arrays of the domains operation types.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            REGISTER_DOMAIN
            DELETE_DOMAIN
            TRANSFER_IN_DOMAIN
            UPDATE_DOMAIN_CONTACT
            UPDATE_NAMESERVER
            CHANGE_PRIVACY_PROTECTION
            DOMAIN_LOCK
            ENABLE_AUTORENEW
            DISABLE_AUTORENEW
            ADD_DNSSEC
            REMOVE_DNSSEC
            EXPIRE_DOMAIN
            TRANSFER_OUT_DOMAIN
            CHANGE_DOMAIN_OWNER
            RENEW_DOMAIN
            PUSH_DOMAIN
            INTERNAL_TRANSFER_OUT_DOMAIN
            INTERNAL_TRANSFER_IN_DOMAIN
            RELEASE_TO_GANDI
            TRANSFER_ON_RENEW

       --sort-by (string)
          The sort type for returned values.

          Possible values:

          o SubmittedDate

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for returned values, either ascending or descending.

          Possible values:

          o ASC

          o DESC

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the status of operations that return an operation ID

       Some domain registration operations run asynchronously and return a re-
       sponse before they finish. These operations return an operation ID that
       you can use to get the current status.  The  following  list-operations
       command lists summary information, including the status, about the cur-
       rent domain-registration operations.

       This command runs only in the us-east-1 Region. If your default  region
       is set to us-east-1, you can omit the region parameter.

          aws route53domains list-operations
              --region us-east-1

       Output:

          {
              "Operations": [
                  {
                      "OperationId": "aab9822f-1da0-4bf3-8a15-fd4e0example",
                      "Status": "SUCCESSFUL",

                      "SubmittedDate": 1547501003.41
                  }
              ]
          }

       The  output includes all the operations that return an operation ID and
       that you have performed on all the domains that you  have  ever  regis-
       tered using the current AWS account. If you want to get only the opera-
       tions that you submitted after a specified date, you  can  include  the
       submitted-since parameter and specify a date in Unix format and Coordi-
       nated Universal Time (UTC). The following command gets  the  status  of
       all  operations  that  were  submitted after 12:00 am UTC on January 1,
       2020.
