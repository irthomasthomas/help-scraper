LIST-DOMAINS()                                                  LIST-DOMAINS()



NAME
       list-domains -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  returns  all  the  domain names registered with Amazon
       Route 53 for the current Amazon Web Services account  if  no  filtering
       conditions are used.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-domains is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Domains

OPTIONS
       --filter-conditions (list)
          A complex type that contains information about the  filters  applied
          during  the  ListDomains  request. The filter conditions can include
          domain name and domain expiration.

          (structure)
              Information for the filtering of a list of domains  returned  by
              ListDomains .

              Name -> (string)
                 Name of the field which should be used for filtering the list
                 of domains.

              Operator -> (string)
                 The operator values for filtering domain  names.  The  values
                 can be:

                 o LE : Less than, or equal to

                 o GE : Greater than, or equal to

                 o BEGINS_WITH : Begins with

              Values -> (list)
                 An array of strings presenting values to compare. Only 1 item
                 in the list is currently supported.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Operator=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "DomainName"|"Expiry",
              "Operator": "LE"|"GE"|"BEGINS_WITH",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sort-condition (structure)
          A complex type that contains information about the requested  order-
          ing of domains in the returned list.

          Name -> (string)
              Field  to be used for sorting the list of domains. It can be ei-
              ther the name or the expiration for a domain. Note that if  fil-
              terCondition  is  used  in  the same ListDomains call, the field
              used for sorting has to be the same as the field used  for  fil-
              tering.

          SortOrder -> (string)
              The  sort order for a list of domains. Either ascending (ASC) or
              descending (DES).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,SortOrder=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "DomainName"|"Expiry",
            "SortOrder": "ASC"|"DESC"
          }

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the domains that are registered with the current AWS account

       The following list-domains command lists summary information about  the
       domains that are registered with the current AWS account.

       This  command runs only in the us-east-1 Region. If your default region
       is set to us-east-1, you can omit the region parameter.

          aws route53domains list-domains
              --region us-east-1

       Output:

          {
