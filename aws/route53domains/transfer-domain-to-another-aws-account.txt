NAME
       transfer-domain-to-another-aws-account -

DESCRIPTION
       Transfers  a domain from the current Amazon Web Services account to an-
       other Amazon Web Services account. Note the following:

       o The Amazon Web Services account that you're transferring  the  domain
         to  must accept the transfer. If the other account doesn't accept the
         transfer   within   3   days,   we   cancel   the    transfer.    See
         AcceptDomainTransferFromAnotherAwsAccount .

       o You  can cancel the transfer before the other account accepts it. See
         CancelDomainTransferToAnotherAwsAccount .

       o The    other    account    can    reject    the     transfer.     See
         RejectDomainTransferFromAnotherAwsAccount .

       WARNING:
          When  you  transfer a domain from one Amazon Web Services account to
          another, Route 53 doesn't transfer the hosted zone that  is  associ-
          ated  with  the  domain. DNS resolution isn't affected if the domain
          and the hosted zone are owned by separate accounts, so  transferring
          the  hosted zone is optional. For information about transferring the
          hosted zone to another Amazon Web Services account, see Migrating  a
          Hosted Zone to a Different Amazon Web Services Account in the Amazon
          Route 53 Developer Guide .

       Use either ListOperations or GetOperationDetail  to  determine  whether
       the  operation succeeded. GetOperationDetail provides additional infor-
       mation, for example, Domain Transfer from Aws Account 111122223333  has
       been cancelled .

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The  name  of  the domain that you want to transfer from the current
          Amazon Web Services account to another account.

       --account-id (string)
          The account ID of the Amazon Web Services account that you  want  to
          transfer the domain to, for example, 111122223333 .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       rides config/env settings.

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)

          operation status, use GetOperationDetail .

       Password -> (string)
          To  finish  transferring a domain to another Amazon Web Services ac-
          count, the account that the domain is being transferred to must sub-
          mit  an  AcceptDomainTransferFromAnotherAwsAccount  request. The re-
          quest must include the value of the Password element  that  was  re-
          turned in the TransferDomainToAnotherAwsAccount response.
