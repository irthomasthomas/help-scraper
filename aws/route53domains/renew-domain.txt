RENEW-DOMAIN()                                                  RENEW-DOMAIN()



NAME
       renew-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  renews a domain for the specified number of years. The
       cost of renewing your domain is billed to your Amazon Web Services  ac-
       count.

       We  recommend that you renew your domain several weeks before the expi-
       ration date. Some TLD registries delete domains before  the  expiration
       date if you haven't renewed far enough in advance. For more information
       about renewing domain registration, see Renewing Registration for a Do-
       main in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of the domain that you want to renew.

       --duration-in-years (integer)
          The number of years that you want to renew the domain for. The maxi-
          mum number of years depends on the top-level domain. For  the  range
          of  valid  values for your domain, see Domains that You Can Register
          with Amazon Route 53 in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

          Default: 1

       --current-expiry-year (integer)
          The year when the registration for the domain is set to expire. This
          value must match the current expiration date for the domain.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To renew a domain

       The following renew-domain command renews the specified domain for five
       years. To get the value for current-expiry-year, use the get-domain-de-
       tail command, and convert the value of ExpirationDate from Unix format.

       This  command runs only in the us-east-1 Region. If your default region
       is set to us-east-1, you can omit the region parameter.

          aws route53domains renew-domain \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --domain-name example.com \
              --duration-in-years 5 \
              --current-expiry-year 2020

       Output:

          {
              "OperationId": "3f28e0ac-126a-4113-9048-cc930example"
          }

       To confirm that the operation succeeded, you can run  get-operation-de-
       tail. For more information, see get-operation-detail.

       The  registry  for  each  top-level domain (TLD), such as .com or .org,
       controls the maximum number of years that you can renew a  domain  for.
       To  get  the maximum renewal period for your domain, see the "Registra-
       tion and Renewal Period" section for your TLD in Domains That  You  Can
       Register with Amazon Route 53 in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

       For  more  information,  see  Renewing Registration for a Domain in the
       Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          Identifier for tracking the progress of the request.  To  query  the
          operation status, use GetOperationDetail .
