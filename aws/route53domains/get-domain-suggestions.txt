OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          A domain name that you want to use as the basis for a list of possi-
          ble  domain names. The top-level domain (TLD), such as .com, must be
          a TLD that Route 53 supports. For a  list  of  supported  TLDs,  see
          Domains  that  You  Can  Register with Amazon Route 53 in the Amazon
          Route 53 Developer Guide .

          The domain name can contain only the following characters:

          o Letters a through z. Domain names are not case sensitive.

          o Numbers 0 through 9.

          o Hyphen (-). You can't specify a hyphen at the beginning or end  of
            a label.

          o Period  (.)  to  separate the labels in the name, such as the . in
            example.com .

          Internationalized domain names are not supported for some  top-level
          domains.  To determine whether the TLD that you want to use supports
          internationalized domain names, see Domains that  You  Can  Register
          with Amazon Route 53 .

       --suggestion-count (integer)
          The  number  of suggested domain names that you want Route 53 to re-
          turn. Specify a value between 1 and 50.

       --only-available | --no-only-available (boolean)
          If OnlyAvailable is true , Route 53 returns only domain  names  that
          are  available.  If OnlyAvailable is false , Route 53 returns domain
          names without checking whether they're available to  be  registered.
          To  determine whether the domain is available, you can call checkDo-
          mainAvailability for each suggestion.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get a list of suggested domain names

       The  following  get-domain-suggestions  command displays a list of sug-
       gested domain names based on the domain name example.com. The  response
       includes  only domain names that are available.  This command runs only
       in the us-east-1 Region. If your default region is  set  to  us-east-1,
       you can omit the region parameter.

          aws route53domains get-domain-suggestions \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --domain-name example.com \
              --suggestion-count 10 \
              --only-available

OUTPUT
       SuggestionsList -> (list)
          A  list  of  possible  domain  names.  If  you  specified  true  for
          OnlyAvailable in the request, the list contains  only  domains  that
          are available for registration.

          (structure)
              Information about one suggested domain name.

              DomainName -> (string)
                 A suggested domain name.

              Availability -> (string)
                 Whether the domain name is available for registering.

                 NOTE:
                     You  can register only the domains that are designated as
                     AVAILABLE .

                 Valid values:
                     AVAILABLE

                 The domain name is available.
                     AVAILABLE_RESERVED

                 The domain name is reserved under specific conditions.
                     AVAILABLE_PREORDER

                 The domain name is available and can be preordered.
                     DONT_KNOW

                 The TLD registry didn't reply with a definitive answer  about
                 whether  the  domain  name  is available. Route 53 can return
                 this response for a variety of reasons, for example, the reg-
                 istry is performing maintenance. Try again later.
                     PENDING

                 The  TLD  registry  didn't  return a response in the expected
                 amount of time. When the  response  is  delayed,  it  usually
                 takes  just a few extra seconds. You can resubmit the request
                 immediately.
                     RESERVED

                 The domain name has been reserved for another person or orga-
                 nization.
                     UNAVAILABLE

                 The domain name is not available.
                     UNAVAILABLE_PREMIUM

                 The domain name is not available.
                     UNAVAILABLE_RESTRICTED

                 The domain name is forbidden.
