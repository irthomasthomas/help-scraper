CREATE-LOG-ANOMALY-DETECTOR()                    CREATE-LOG-ANOMALY-DETECTOR()



NAME
       create-log-anomaly-detector -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an anomaly detector that regularly scans one or more log groups
       and look for patterns and anomalies in the logs.

       An anomaly detector can help surface issues by automatically  discover-
       ing  anomalies  in your log event traffic. An anomaly detector uses ma-
       chine learning algorithms to scan log events and find patterns . A pat-
       tern is a shared text structure that recurs among your log fields. Pat-
       terns provide a useful tool for analyzing large sets of logs because  a
       large number of log events can often be compressed into a few patterns.

       The anomaly detector uses pattern recognition to find anomalies , which
       are unusual log events. It uses the evaluationFrequency to compare cur-
       rent log events and patterns with trained baselines.

       Fields  within  a pattern are called tokens . Fields that vary within a
       pattern, such as a request ID or timestamp, are referred to as  dynamic
       tokens and represented by <*> .

       The following is an example of a pattern:
          [INFO] Request time: <*> ms

       This pattern represents log events like [INFO] Request time: 327 ms and
       other similar log events that differ only by the number, in  this  csse
       327.  When the pattern is displayed, the different numbers are replaced
       by <*>

       NOTE:
          Any parts of log events that are masked as sensitive  data  are  not
          scanned  for anomalies. For more information about masking sensitive
          data, see Help protect sensitive log data with masking .

OPTIONS
       --log-group-arn-list (list)
          An array containing the ARN of the log group that this  anomaly  de-
          tector will watch. You can specify only one log group ARN.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --detector-name (string)
          A name for this anomaly detector.

       --evaluation-frequency (string)
          Specifies  how  often  the  anomaly  detector is to run and look for
          anomalies. Set this value according to the frequency  that  the  log
          group  receives new logs. For example, if the log group receives new
          log events every 10 minutes, then 15 minutes might be a good setting
          for evaluationFrequency .

          Possible values:

          o ONE_MIN

          o FIVE_MIN

          o TEN_MIN

          o FIFTEEN_MIN

          o THIRTY_MIN

          o ONE_HOUR

       --filter-pattern (string)
          You  can  use this parameter to limit the anomaly detection model to
          examine only log events that match the pattern you specify here. For
          more information, see Filter and Pattern Syntax .

       --kms-key-id (string)
          Optionally assigns a KMS key to secure this anomaly detector and its
          findings. If a key is assigned, the anomalies found  and  the  model
          used  by  this detector are encrypted at rest with the key. If a key
          is assigned to an anomaly detector, a user must have permissions for
          both  this  key and for the anomaly detector to retrieve information
          about the anomalies that it finds.

          For more information about using a KMS key and to see  the  required
          IAM policy, see Use a KMS key with an anomaly detector .

       --anomaly-visibility-time (long)
          The number of days to have visibility on an anomaly. After this time
          period has elapsed for an anomaly, it will  be  automatically  base-
          lined and the anomaly detector will treat new occurrences of a simi-
          lar anomaly as normal. Therefore, if you do not correct the cause of
          an anomaly during the time period specified in anomalyVisibilityTime
          , it will be considered normal going forward and  will  not  be  de-
          tected as an anomaly.

       --tags (map)
          An optional list of key-value pairs to associate with the resource.

          For  more information about tagging, see Tagging Amazon Web Services
          resources

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       anomalyDetectorArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the log anomaly detector that you just created.
