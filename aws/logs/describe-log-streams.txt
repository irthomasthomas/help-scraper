DESCRIBE-LOG-STREAMS()                                  DESCRIBE-LOG-STREAMS()



NAME
       describe-log-streams -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the log streams for the specified log group. You can list all the
       log streams or filter the results by prefix. You can also  control  how
       the results are ordered.

       This operation has a limit of five transactions per second, after which
       transactions are throttled.

       If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability,  you  can  use
       this  operation  in  a monitoring account and view data from the linked
       source accounts. For more information, see CloudWatch cross-account ob-
       servability .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-log-streams  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: logStreams

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group.

          NOTE:
              If you specify values for both logGroupName and  logGroupIdenti-
              fier , the action returns an InvalidParameterException error.

       --log-group-identifier (string)
          Specify  either the name or ARN of the log group to view. If the log
          group is in a source account and you are using a monitoring account,
          you must use the log group ARN.

          If you specify values for both logGroupName and logGroupIdentifier ,
          the action returns an InvalidParameterException error.

       --log-stream-name-prefix (string)
          The prefix to match.

          If orderBy is LastEventTime , you cannot specify this parameter.

       --order-by (string)
          If the value is LogStreamName ,  the  results  are  ordered  by  log
          stream name. If the value is LastEventTime , the results are ordered
          by the event time. The default value is LogStreamName .

          If you order the results by  event  time,  you  cannot  specify  the
          logStreamNamePrefix parameter.
              lastEventTimestamp  represents  the  time of the most recent log
              event in the log stream in CloudWatch Logs. This number  is  ex-
              pressed as the number of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00
              UTC . lastEventTimestamp updates on an eventual consistency  ba-
              sis.  It  typically updates in less than an hour from ingestion,
              but in rare situations might take longer.

          Possible values:

          o LogStreamName

          o LastEventTime

       --descending | --no-descending (boolean)
          If the value is true, results are returned in descending  order.  If
          the  value is to false, results are returned in ascending order. The
          default value is false.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The  following  command  shows all log streams starting with the prefix
       2015 in the log group my-logs:

          aws logs describe-log-streams --log-group-name my-logs --log-stream-name-prefix 2015

       Output:

          {

OUTPUT
       logStreams -> (list)
          The log streams.

          (structure)
              Represents a log stream, which is a sequence of log events  from
              a single emitter of logs.

              logStreamName -> (string)
                 The name of the log stream.

              creationTime -> (long)
                 The  creation  time of the stream, expressed as the number of
                 milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC .

              firstEventTimestamp -> (long)
                 The time of the first event, expressed as the number of  mil-
                 liseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC .

              lastEventTimestamp -> (long)
                 The  time  of  the most recent log event in the log stream in
                 CloudWatch Logs. This number is expressed as  the  number  of
                 milliseconds  after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC . The lastEvent-
                 Time value updates on an eventual consistency basis. It typi-
                 cally  updates  in  less  than an hour from ingestion, but in
                 rare situations might take longer.

              lastIngestionTime -> (long)
                 The ingestion time, expressed as the number  of  milliseconds

                     longer supported for log streams, and is always  reported
                     as  zero.  This  change  applies only to log streams. The
                     storedBytes parameter for log groups is not affected.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. The token expires af-
          ter 24 hours.
