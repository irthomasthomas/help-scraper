START-LIVE-TAIL()                                            START-LIVE-TAIL()



NAME
       start-live-tail -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts a Live Tail streaming session for one or more log groups. A Live
       Tail session provides a near real-time streaming of log events as  they
       are  ingested into selected log groups. A session can go on for a maxi-
       mum of 3 hours.

       You must have logs:StartLiveTail permission to perform this  operation.
       If  the  log  events  matching the filters are more than 500 events per
       second, we sample the events to provide the real-time  tailing  experi-
       ence.

       If  you  are  using CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can use
       this operation in  a  monitoring  account  and  start  tailing  on  Log
       Group(s)  present  in the linked source accounts. For more information,
       see                             <a                              href="-

OPTIONS
       --log-group-identifiers  (list)  The Log Group Identifiers are the ARNs
       for the CloudWatch Logs groups to tail. You can provide up  to  10  Log
       Group  Identifiers.  Logs can be filtered by Log Stream(s) by providing
       --log-stream-names or --log-stream-name-prefixes. If more than one  Log
       Group  is provided --log-stream-names and --log-stream-name-prefixes is
       disabled. --log-stream-names and  --log-stream-name-prefixes  can't  be
       provided  simultaneously.  Note - The Log Group ARN must be in the fol-
       lowing format. Replace REGION and ACCOUNT_ID with your Region  and  ac-
       count  ID. arn:aws:logs:REGION :ACCOUNT_ID :log-group:LOG_GROUP_NAME. A
       :* after the ARN is prohibited.For more information about  ARN  format,
       see CloudWatch Logs resources and operations .(string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --log-stream-names  (list)  The list of stream names to filter logs by.
       This parameter cannot be specified when --log-stream-name-prefixes  are
       also  specified.  This  parameter  cannot  be  specified  when multiple
       log-group-identifiers are specified(string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --log-stream-name-prefixes (list) The prefix to filter  logs  by.  Only
       events  from  log streams with names beginning with this prefix will be
       returned. This parameter cannot be specified when --log-stream-names is
       also  specified.  This  parameter  cannot  be  specified  when multiple
       log-group-identifiers are specified(string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --log-event-filter-pattern (string) The  filter  pattern  to  use.  See
       Filter  and Pattern Syntax for details. If not provided, all the events
       are matched. This option can be used to include or exclude  log  events
       patterns.  Additionally,  when  multiple  filter patterns are provided,
       they must be encapsulated by quotes.
