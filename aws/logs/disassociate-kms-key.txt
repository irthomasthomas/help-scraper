DISASSOCIATE-KMS-KEY()                                  DISASSOCIATE-KMS-KEY()



NAME
       disassociate-kms-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociates  the  specified  KMS  key from the specified log group or
       from all CloudWatch Logs Insights query results in the account.

       When you use DisassociateKmsKey , you specify either  the  logGroupName
       parameter  or  the resourceIdentifier parameter. You can't specify both
       of those parameters in the same operation.

       o Specify the logGroupName parameter to stop using the KMS key  to  en-
         crypt  future  log  events  ingested and stored in the log group. In-
         stead, they will  be  encrypted  with  the  default  CloudWatch  Logs
         method.  The  log events that were ingested while the key was associ-
         ated with the log group are still encrypted with that key. Therefore,
         CloudWatch  Logs will need permissions for the key whenever that data
         is accessed.

       o Specify the resourceIdentifier parameter with  the  query-result  re-
         source to stop using the KMS key to encrypt the results of all future
         StartQuery operations in the account. They will instead be  encrypted
         with  the  default  CloudWatch  Logs method. The results from queries
         that ran while the key was associated with the account are still  en-
         crypted  with  that key. Therefore, CloudWatch Logs will need permis-
         sions for the key whenever that data is accessed.

       It can take up to 5 minutes for this operation to take effect.

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group.

          In your DisassociateKmsKey operation, you must  specify  either  the
          resourceIdentifier  parameter  or  the  logGroup  parameter, but you
          can't specify both.

       --resource-identifier (string)
          Specifies the target for this operation. You must specify one of the
          following:

          o Specify  the ARN of a log group to stop having CloudWatch Logs use
            the KMS key to encrypt log events that are ingested and stored  by
            that  log group. After you run this operation, CloudWatch Logs en-
            crypts ingested  log  events  with  the  default  CloudWatch  Logs
            method. The log group ARN must be in the following format. Replace
            REGION and ACCOUNT_ID with your Region and account ID.
            ``
            arn:aws:logs:REGION :ACCOUNT_ID :log-group:LOG_GROUP_NAME ``

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 93)
            Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          o Specify the following ARN to stop using this key  to  encrypt  the
            results  of  future StartQuery operations in this account. Replace
            REGION  and  ACCOUNT_ID  with  your   Region   and   account   ID.
            arn:aws:logs:*REGION* :*ACCOUNT_ID* :query-result:*

          In your DisssociateKmsKey operation, you must specify either the re-
          sourceIdentifier parameter or the logGroup parameter, but you  can't
          specify both.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       None
