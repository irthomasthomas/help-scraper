PUT-DELIVERY-SOURCE()                                    PUT-DELIVERY-SOURCE()



NAME
       put-delivery-source -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates or updates a logical delivery source . A delivery source repre-
       sents an Amazon Web Services resource that sends logs to an logs deliv-
       ery  destination. The destination can be CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3, or
       Firehose.

       To configure logs delivery between a delivery destination and an Amazon
       Web  Services  service that is supported as a delivery source, you must
       do the following:

       o Use PutDeliverySource to create a delivery source, which is a logical
         object  that  represents  the  resource  that is actually sending the
         logs.

       o Use PutDeliveryDestination to create a delivery destination  ,  which
         is  a logical object that represents the actual delivery destination.
         For more information, see PutDeliveryDestination .

       o If  you   are   delivering   logs   cross-account,   you   must   use
         PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy  in the destination account to assign an
         IAM policy to the destination. This policy allows  delivery  to  that
         destination.

       o Use CreateDelivery to create a delivery by pairing exactly one deliv-
         ery source and one delivery destination. For  more  information,  see
         CreateDelivery .

       You  can  configure  a  single delivery source to send logs to multiple
       destinations by creating multiple deliveries. You can also create  mul-
       tiple deliveries to configure multiple delivery sources to send logs to
       the same delivery destination.

       Only some Amazon Web Services services support being  configured  as  a
       delivery  source.  These  services  are listed as Supported [V2 Permis-
       sions] in the table at Enabling logging from Amazon Web  Services  ser-
       vices.

       If  you  use  this operation to update an existing delivery source, all
       the current delivery source parameters are overwritten with the new pa-
       rameter values that you specify.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A  name  for  this delivery source. This name must be unique for all
          delivery sources in your account.

       --resource-arn (string)
          The ARN of the Amazon Web Services resource that is  generating  and
          sending        logs.        For        example,        arn:aws:work-
          mail:us-east-1:123456789012:organization/m-1234EXAM-
          PLEabcd1234abcd1234abcd1234

       --log-type (string)
          Defines the type of log that the source is sending.

          o For Amazon Bedrock, the valid value is APPLICATION_LOGS .

          o For Amazon CodeWhisperer, the valid value is EVENT_LOGS .

          o For IAM Identity Center, the valid value is ERROR_LOGS .

          o For  Amazon  WorkMail,  the valid values are ACCESS_CONTROL_LOGS ,
            AUTHENTICATION_LOGS ,  WORKMAIL_AVAILABILITY_PROVIDER_LOGS  ,  and
            WORKMAIL_MAILBOX_ACCESS_LOGS .

       --tags (map)
          An optional list of key-value pairs to associate with the resource.

          For  more information about tagging, see Tagging Amazon Web Services
          resources

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
