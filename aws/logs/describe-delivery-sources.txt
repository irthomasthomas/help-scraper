DESCRIBE-DELIVERY-SOURCES()                        DESCRIBE-DELIVERY-SOURCES()



NAME
       describe-delivery-sources -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a list of the delivery sources that have been created in the
       account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-delivery-sources is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: deliverySources

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       deliverySources -> (list)
          An array of structures. Each structure  contains  information  about
          one delivery source in the account.

          (structure)
              This structure contains information about one delivery source in
              your account. A delivery source is an Amazon  Web  Services  re-
              source  that  sends  logs to an Amazon Web Services destination.
              The destination can be CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3, or Firehose.

              Only some Amazon Web Services services support being  configured
              as a delivery source. These services are listed as Supported [V2
              Permissions] in the table at Enabling logging  from  Amazon  Web
              Services services.

              To  configure  logs delivery between a supported Amazon Web Ser-
              vices service and a destination, you must do the following:

              o Create a delivery source, which is a logical object that  rep-
                resents  the  resource  that is actually sending the logs. For
                more information, see PutDeliverySource .

              o Create a delivery destination , which is a logical object that
                represents  the actual delivery destination. For more informa-
                tion, see PutDeliveryDestination .

              o If  you  are  delivering  logs  cross-account,  you  must  use
                PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy in the destination account to as-
                sign an IAM policy to the destination. This policy allows  de-
                livery to that destination.

              o Create  a  delivery by pairing exactly one delivery source and
                one  delivery   destination.   For   more   information,   see
                CreateDelivery .

              You  can configure a single delivery source to send logs to mul-
              tiple destinations by creating multiple deliveries. You can also
              create   multiple  deliveries  to  configure  multiple  delivery
              sources to send logs to the same delivery destination.

              name -> (string)
                 The unique name of the delivery source.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies  this
                 delivery source.

              resourceArns -> (list)
                 This  array  contains  the ARN of the Amazon Web Services re-
                 source that sends logs and is represented  by  this  delivery
                 source. Currently, only one ARN can be in the array.

                 (string)

              service -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services service that is sending logs.

              logType -> (string)
                 The  type of log that the source is sending. For valid values
                 for this parameter, see the documentation for the source ser-
                 vice.

              tags -> (map)
                 The tags that have been assigned to this delivery source.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. The token expires af-
          ter 24 hours.
