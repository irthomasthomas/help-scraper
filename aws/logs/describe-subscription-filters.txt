DESCRIBE-SUBSCRIPTION-FILTERS()                DESCRIBE-SUBSCRIPTION-FILTERS()



NAME
       describe-subscription-filters -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  subscription  filters  for the specified log group. You can
       list all the subscription filters or filter the results by prefix.  The
       results are ASCII-sorted by filter name.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-subscription-filters  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: subscriptionFilters

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group.

       --filter-name-prefix (string)
          The prefix to match. If you don't specify a value, no prefix  filter
          is applied.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       subscriptionFilters -> (list)
          The subscription filters.

          (structure)
              Represents a subscription filter.

              filterName -> (string)
                 The name of the subscription filter.

              logGroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the log group.

              filterPattern -> (string)
                 A symbolic description of how CloudWatch Logs  should  inter-
                 pret the data in each log event. For example, a log event can
                 contain timestamps, IP addresses, strings, and so on. You use
                 the  filter  pattern  to  specify what to look for in the log
                 event message.

              destinationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the destination.

              roleArn -> (string)

              distribution -> (string)
                 The method used to distribute log data  to  the  destination,
                 which can be either random or grouped by log stream.

              applyOnTransformedLogs -> (boolean)
                 This  parameter is valid only for log groups that have an ac-
                 tive log transformer. For more information about  log  trans-
                 formers, see PutTransformer .

                 If this value is true , the subscription filter is applied on
                 the transformed version of the  log  events  instead  of  the
                 original ingested log events.

              creationTime -> (long)
                 The  creation  time  of the subscription filter, expressed as
                 the number of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC .

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. The token expires af-
          ter 24 hours.
