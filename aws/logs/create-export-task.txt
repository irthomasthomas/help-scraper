CREATE-EXPORT-TASK()                                      CREATE-EXPORT-TASK()



NAME
       create-export-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  export  task,  which allows you to efficiently export data
       from a log group to an Amazon S3 bucket. When you perform  a  CreateEx-
       portTask  operation,  you  must use credentials that have permission to
       write to the S3 bucket that you specify as the destination.

       WARNING:
          Exporting log data to Amazon S3 buckets that are encrypted by KMS is
          not  supported. Exporting log data to Amazon S3 buckets that have S3
          Object Lock enabled with a retention period is not supported.

          Exporting to S3 buckets that are  encrypted  with  AES-256  is  sup-
          ported.

       This  is  an asynchronous call. If all the required information is pro-
       vided, this operation initiates an export task and responds with the ID
       of   the   task.   After   the   task   has   started,   you   can  use
       DescribeExportTasks to get the status of the export task. Each  account
       can  only  have one active (RUNNING or PENDING ) export task at a time.
       To cancel an export task, use CancelExportTask .

       You can export logs from multiple log groups or multiple time ranges to
       the  same S3 bucket. To separate out log data for each export task, you
       can specify a prefix to be used as the Amazon S3 key prefix for all ex-
       ported objects.

       NOTE:
          Time-based  sorting on chunks of log data inside an exported file is
          not guaranteed. You can sort the exported log  fild  data  by  using
          Linux utilities.

OPTIONS
       --task-name (string)
          The name of the export task.

       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group.

       --log-stream-name-prefix (string)
          Export only log streams that match the provided prefix. If you don't
          specify a value, no prefix filter is applied.

       --from (long)
          The start time of the range for the request, expressed as the number
          of  milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. Events with a time-
          stamp earlier than this time are not exported.

       --to (long)
          The end time of the range for the request, expressed as  the  number
          of  milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. Events with a time-
          stamp later than this time are not exported.

       --destination (string)
          The name of S3 bucket for the exported log data. The bucket must  be
          in the same Amazon Web Services region.

       --destination-prefix (string)
          The  prefix  used as the start of the key for every object exported.
          If you don't specify a value, the default is exportedlogs .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       taskId -> (string)
          The ID of the export task.
