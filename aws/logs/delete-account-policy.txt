DELETE-ACCOUNT-POLICY()                                DELETE-ACCOUNT-POLICY()



NAME
       delete-account-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  CloudWatch Logs account policy. This stops the account-wide
       policy from applying to log groups in the account. If you delete a data
       protection  policy  or  subscription filter policy, any log-group level
       policies of those types remain in effect.

       To use this operation, you must be signed on with the  correct  permis-
       sions depending on the type of policy that you are deleting.

       o To delete a data protection policy, you must have the logs:DeleteDat-
         aProtectionPolicy and logs:DeleteAccountPolicy permissions.

       o To  delete  a  subscription  filter  policy,  you   must   have   the
         logs:DeleteSubscriptionFilter  and  logs:DeleteAccountPolicy  permis-
         sions.

       o To delete a transformer policy, you must have  the  logs:DeleteTrans-
         former and logs:DeleteAccountPolicy permissions.

       o To  delete  a field index policy, you must have the logs:DeleteIndex-
         Policy and logs:DeleteAccountPolicy permissions.

       If you delete a field index policy, the indexing of the log events that
       happened  before you deleted the policy will still be used for up to 30
       days to improve CloudWatch Logs Insights queries.

OPTIONS
       --policy-name (string)
          The name of the policy to delete.

       --policy-type (string)
          The type of policy to delete.

          Possible values:

          o DATA_PROTECTION_POLICY

          o SUBSCRIPTION_FILTER_POLICY

          o FIELD_INDEX_POLICY

          o TRANSFORMER_POLICY

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
