PUT-DESTINATION()                                            PUT-DESTINATION()



NAME
       put-destination -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates or updates a destination. This operation is used only to create
       destinations for cross-account subscriptions.

       A destination encapsulates a physical resource (such as an Amazon Kine-
       sis  stream)  and enables you to subscribe to a real-time stream of log
       events for a different account, ingested using PutLogEvents .

       Through an access policy, a destination controls what is written to it.
       By default, PutDestination does not set any access policy with the des-
       tination,   which   means   a   cross-account    user    cannot    call
       PutSubscriptionFilter  against  this  destination.  To enable this, the
       destination owner must call PutDestinationPolicy after PutDestination .

       To perform a PutDestination operation, you must also have the iam:Pass-
       Role permission.

OPTIONS
       --destination-name (string)
          A name for the destination.

       --target-arn (string)
          The ARN of an Amazon Kinesis stream to which to deliver matching log
          events.

       --role-arn (string)
          The ARN of an IAM role that grants CloudWatch  Logs  permissions  to
          call  the  Amazon  Kinesis  PutRecord  operation  on the destination
          stream.

       --tags (map)
          An optional list of key-value pairs to associate with the resource.

          For more information about tagging, see Tagging Amazon Web  Services
          resources

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       destination -> (structure)
          The destination.

          destinationName -> (string)
              The name of the destination.

          targetArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the physical target where  the
              log events are delivered (for example, a Kinesis stream).

          roleArn -> (string)
              A role for impersonation, used when delivering log events to the
              target.
