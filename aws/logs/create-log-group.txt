CREATE-LOG-GROUP()                                          CREATE-LOG-GROUP()



NAME
       create-log-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  log  group  with  the  specified name. You can create up to
       20,000 log groups per account.

       You must use the following guidelines when naming a log group:

       o Log group names must be unique within a region for an Amazon Web Ser-
         vices account.

       o Log group names can be between 1 and 512 characters long.

       o Log  group  names consist of the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9,
         '_' (underscore), '-' (hyphen), '/' (forward  slash),  '.'  (period),
         and '#' (number sign)

       When you create a log group, by default the log events in the log group
       never expire. To set a retention policy so that events expire  and  are
       deleted after a specified time, use PutRetentionPolicy .

       If  you  associate  a  Key Management Service customer master key (CMK)
       with the log group, ingested data is encrypted using the CMK. This  as-
       sociation is stored as long as the data encrypted with the CMK is still
       within CloudWatch Logs. This enables CloudWatch Logs  to  decrypt  this
       data whenever it is requested.

       If  you  attempt to associate a CMK with the log group but the CMK does
       not exist or the CMK is disabled, you receive an InvalidParameterExcep-
       tion error.

       WARNING:
          CloudWatch  Logs  supports  only symmetric CMKs. Do not associate an
          asymmetric CMK with your log group. For more information, see  Using
          Symmetric and Asymmetric Keys .

SYNOPSIS
            create-log-group
          --log-group-name <value>
          [--kms-key-id <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK to use when encrypting log
          data. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names - Key  Manage-
          ment Service .

       --tags (map)
          The key-value pairs to use for the tags.

          CloudWatch  Logs doesnt support IAM policies that prevent users from
          assigning  specified  tags  to  log   groups   using   the   aws:Re-
          source/*key-name*  ``  or ``aws:TagKeys condition keys. For more in-
          formation about using tags to control access, see Controlling access
          to Amazon Web Services resources using tags .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command creates a log group named my-logs:

          aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name my-logs

OUTPUT
       None
