CREATE-LOG-GROUP()                                          CREATE-LOG-GROUP()



NAME
       create-log-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  log  group  with  the  specified name. You can create up to
       1,000,000 log groups per Region per account.

       You must use the following guidelines when naming a log group:

       o Log group names must be unique within a Region for an Amazon Web Ser-
         vices account.

       o Log group names can be between 1 and 512 characters long.

       o Log  group  names consist of the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9,
         '_' (underscore), '-' (hyphen), '/' (forward  slash),  '.'  (period),
         and '#' (number sign)

       When you create a log group, by default the log events in the log group
       do not expire. To set a retention policy so that events expire and  are
       deleted after a specified time, use PutRetentionPolicy .

       If  you  associate  an KMS key with the log group, ingested data is en-
       crypted using the KMS key. This association is stored as  long  as  the
       data  encrypted  with the KMS key is still within CloudWatch Logs. This
       enables CloudWatch Logs to decrypt this data whenever it is requested.

       If you attempt to associate a KMS key with the log group  but  the  KMS
       key  does not exist or the KMS key is disabled, you receive an Invalid-
       ParameterException error.

       WARNING:
          CloudWatch Logs supports only symmetric KMS keys. Do  not  associate
          an asymmetric KMS key with your log group. For more information, see
          Using Symmetric and Asymmetric Keys .

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key to use when encrypting
          log data. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names .

       --tags (map)
          The key-value pairs to use for the tags.

          You  can  grant  users access to certain log groups while preventing
          them from accessing other log groups. To do so, tag your groups  and
          use  IAM  policies that refer to those tags. To assign tags when you
          create a log group, you must have  either  the  logs:TagResource  or
          logs:TagLogGroup permission. For more information about tagging, see
          Tagging Amazon Web Services resources . For more  information  about
          using  tags  to control access, see Controlling access to Amazon Web
          Services resources using tags .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command creates a log group named my-logs:

          aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name my-logs

OUTPUT
       None
