LIST-ANOMALIES()                                              LIST-ANOMALIES()



NAME
       list-anomalies -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of anomalies that log anomaly detectors have found. For
       details about the structure format of each anomaly object that  is  re-
       turned, see the example in this section.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-anomalies  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: anomalies

OPTIONS
       --anomaly-detector-arn (string)
          Use this to optionally limit the results to only the anomalies found
          by a certain anomaly detector.

       --suppression-state (string)
          You  can  specify this parameter if you want to the operation to re-
          turn only anomalies that are currently either suppressed  or  unsup-
          pressed.

          Possible values:

          o SUPPRESSED

          o UNSUPPRESSED

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

              anomalyDetectorArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the anomaly detector that identified this anomaly.

              patternString -> (string)

                 expression format.

              priority -> (string)
                 The  priority  level of this anomaly, as determined by Cloud-
                 Watch Logs. Priority is computed based on log severity labels
                 such  as FATAL and ERROR and the amount of deviation from the
                 baseline. Possible values are HIGH , MEDIUM , and LOW .

              firstSeen -> (long)
                 The date and time when the anomaly detector  first  saw  this
                 anomaly.  It  is specified as epoch time, which is the number
                 of seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC .

              lastSeen -> (long)
                 The date and time when the anomaly detector most recently saw
                 this  anomaly.  It  is  specified as epoch time, which is the
                 number of seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC .

              description -> (string)
                 A human-readable description of the anomaly. This description
                 is generated by CloudWatch Logs.

              state -> (string)
                 Indicates  the  current state of this anomaly. If it is still
                 being treated as an anomaly, the value is  Active  .  If  you
                 have suppressed this anomaly by using the UpdateAnomaly oper-
                 ation, the value is Suppressed . If this behavior is now con-
                 sidered to be normal, the value is Baseline .

              histogram -> (map)
                 A  map  showing  times when the anomaly detector ran, and the
                 number of occurrences of this anomaly that were  detected  at
                 each  of  those  runs. The times are specified in epoch time,
                 which is  the  number  of  seconds  since  January  1,  1970,
                 00:00:00 UTC .

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (long)

              logSamples -> (list)
                 An  array of sample log event messages that are considered to
                 be part of this anomaly.

                 (structure)
                     This structure contains the information  for  one  sample
                     log  event  that is associated with an anomaly found by a
                     log anomaly detector.

                     timestamp -> (long)
                        The time stamp of the log event.

                     message -> (string)
                        The message content of the log event.

              patternTokens -> (list)
                 An array of structures where each structure contains informa-
                 tion about one token that makes up the pattern.

                 (structure)
                     A  structure  that contains information about one pattern
                     token related to an anomaly.

                     For more  information  about  patterns  and  tokens,  see
                     CreateLogAnomalyDetector .

                     dynamicTokenPosition -> (integer)
                        For  a dynamic token, this indicates where in the pat-
                        tern that this token appears, related to other dynamic
                        tokens.  The  dynamic  token  that appears first has a
                        value of 1 , the one that appears second is 2 , and so
                        on.

                     isDynamic -> (boolean)
                        Specifies whether this is a dynamic token.

                     tokenString -> (string)
                        The string represented by this token. If this is a dy-
                        namic token, the value will be <*>

                     enumerations -> (map)
                        Contains the values found for a dynamic token, and the
                        number of times each value was found.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (long)

                     inferredTokenName -> (string)
                        A  name  that CloudWatch Logs assigned to this dynamic
                        token to make the pattern more  readable.  The  string
                        part of the inferredTokenName gives you a clearer idea
                        of the content of this token. The number part  of  the
                        inferredTokenName  shows where in the pattern this to-
                        ken appears, compared to other dynamic tokens.  Cloud-
                        Watch  Logs  assigns the string part of the name based
                        on analyzing the content of the log events  that  con-
                        tain it.

                        For  example,  an  inferred  token name of IPAddress-3
                        means that the token represents  an  IP  address,  and
                        this token is the third dynamic token in the pattern.

              logGroupArnList -> (list)
                 An  array of ARNS of the log groups that contained log events
                 considered to be part of this anomaly.

                 (string)

              suppressed -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether this anomaly is  currently  suppressed.  To
                 suppress an anomaly, use UpdateAnomaly .

              suppressedDate -> (long)
                 If the anomaly is suppressed, this indicates when it was sup-
                 pressed.

              suppressedUntil -> (long)
                 If the anomaly is suppressed, this indicates  when  the  sup-
                 pression  will end. If this value is 0 , the anomaly was sup-
                 pressed with no expiration, with the INFINITE value.

              isPatternLevelSuppression -> (boolean)
                 If this anomaly is suppressed, this field is true if the sup-
                 pression  is  because  the  pattern is suppressed. If false ,
                 then only this particular anomaly is suppressed.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. The token expires af-
          ter 24 hours.
