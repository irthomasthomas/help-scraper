NAME
       get-delivery -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns complete information about one logical delivery . A delivery is
       a      connection      between      a      `      delivery       source
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliverySource.html`__
       and           a            `            delivery            destination
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliveryDestination.html`__
       .

       A delivery source represents an Amazon Web Services resource that sends
       logs to an logs delivery destination. The destination can be CloudWatch
       Logs, Amazon S3, or Firehose. Only some Amazon  Web  Services  services
       support  being  configured  as  a  delivery  source. These services are
       listed in Enable logging from Amazon Web Services services.

       You need to specify the delivery id in this operation. You can find the
       IDs of the deliveries in your account with the DescribeDeliveries oper-
       ation.

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the delivery that you want to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

              suffixPath -> (string)
                 This string allows re-configuring the  S3  object  prefix  to
                 contain  either  static or variable sections. The valid vari-
                 ables to use in the suffix path will vary by each log source.

                 info on what values are supported in the suffix path for each
                 log source.

              enableHiveCompatiblePath -> (boolean)
                 This  parameter  causes the S3 objects that contain delivered
