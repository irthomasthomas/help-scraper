PUT-DELIVERY-DESTINATION()                          PUT-DELIVERY-DESTINATION()



NAME
       put-delivery-destination -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates or updates a logical delivery destination . A delivery destina-
       tion is an Amazon Web Services resource that represents an  Amazon  Web
       Services  service that logs can be sent to. CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3,
       and Firehose are supported as logs delivery destinations.

       To configure logs delivery between a supported Amazon Web Services ser-
       vice and a destination, you must do the following:

       o Create  a  delivery source, which is a logical object that represents
         the resource that is actually sending the logs. For more information,
         see PutDeliverySource .

       o Use  PutDeliveryDestination  to create a delivery destination , which
         is a logical object that represents the actual delivery destination.

       o If  you   are   delivering   logs   cross-account,   you   must   use
         PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy  in the destination account to assign an
         IAM policy to the destination. This policy allows  delivery  to  that
         destination.

       o Use CreateDelivery to create a delivery by pairing exactly one deliv-
         ery source and one delivery destination. For  more  information,  see
         CreateDelivery .

       You  can  configure  a  single delivery source to send logs to multiple
       destinations by creating multiple deliveries. You can also create  mul-
       tiple deliveries to configure multiple delivery sources to send logs to
       the same delivery destination.

       Only some Amazon Web Services services support being  configured  as  a
       delivery  source.  These  services  are listed as Supported [V2 Permis-
       sions] in the table at Enabling logging from Amazon Web  Services  ser-
       vices.

       If  you  use this operation to update an existing delivery destination,
       all the current delivery destination parameters  are  overwritten  with
       the new parameter values that you specify.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A  name  for this delivery destination. This name must be unique for
          all delivery destinations in your account.

       --output-format (string)
          The format for the logs that this delivery destination will receive.

          Possible values:

          o json

          o plain

          o w3c

          o raw

          o parquet

       --delivery-destination-configuration (structure)
          A structure that contains the ARN of the  Amazon  Web  Services  re-
          source that will receive the logs.

          destinationResourceArn -> (string)
              The  ARN of the Amazon Web Services destination that this deliv-
              ery destination represents. That Amazon Web Services destination
              can be a log group in CloudWatch Logs, an Amazon S3 bucket, or a
              delivery stream in Firehose.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          destinationResourceArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "destinationResourceArn": "string"
          }

       --tags (map)
          An optional list of key-value pairs to associate with the resource.

          For more information about tagging, see Tagging Amazon Web  Services
          resources

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)
