PUT-INTEGRATION()                                            PUT-INTEGRATION()



NAME
       put-integration -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  integration between CloudWatch Logs and another service in
       this account. Currently, only integrations with OpenSearch Service  are
       supported,  and currently you can have only one integration in your ac-
       count.

       Integrating with OpenSearch Service makes it possible for you to create
       curated  vended  logs dashboards, powered by OpenSearch Service analyt-
       ics. For more information, see Vended log dashboards powered by  Amazon
       OpenSearch Service .

       You  can use this operation only to create a new integration. You can't
       modify an existing integration.

OPTIONS
       --integration-name (string)
          A name for the integration.

       --resource-config (tagged union structure)
          A structure that contains configuration information for the integra-
          tion that you are creating.

          NOTE:
              This  is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following top
              level keys can be set: openSearchResourceConfig.

          openSearchResourceConfig -> (structure)
              This structure contains configuration details about an  integra-
              tion between CloudWatch Logs and OpenSearch Service.

              kmsKeyArn -> (string)
                 To  have the vended dashboard data encrypted with KMS instead
                 of the CloudWatch Logs default encryption method, specify the
                 ARN of the KMS key that you want to use.

              dataSourceRoleArn -> (string)
                 Specify  the ARN of an IAM role that CloudWatch Logs will use
                 to create the integration. This role must  have  the  permis-
                 sions  necessary  to access the OpenSearch Service collection
                 to be able to create the  dashboards.  For  more  information
                 about  the  permissions needed, see Create an IAM role to ac-
                 cess the OpenSearch Service collection in the CloudWatch Logs
                 User Guide.

              dashboardViewerPrincipals -> (list)
                 Specify  the  ARNs of IAM roles and IAM users who you want to
                 grant permission to for viewing the dashboards.

                 WARNING:
                     In addition to specifying these users here, you must also
                     grant  them  the CloudWatchOpenSearchDashboardsAccess IAM
                     policy. For more information, see

                 (string)

              applicationArn -> (string)
                 If you want to use an existing OpenSearch Service application
                 for  your  integration  with  OpenSearch  Service, specify it
                 here. If you omit this, a new application will be created.

              retentionDays -> (integer)
                 Specify how many days that  you  want  the  data  derived  by
                 OpenSearch Service to be retained in the index that the dash-
                 board refers to. This also sets the maximum time period  that
                 you can choose when viewing data in the dashboard. Choosing a
                 longer time frame will incur additional costs.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          openSearchResourceConfig={kmsKeyArn=string,dataSourceRoleArn=string,dashboardViewerPrincipals=[string,string],applicationArn=string,retentionDays=integer}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "openSearchResourceConfig": {
              "kmsKeyArn": "string",
              "dataSourceRoleArn": "string",
              "dashboardViewerPrincipals": ["string", ...],
              "applicationArn": "string",
              "retentionDays": integer
            }
          }

       --integration-type (string)
          The type of integration.  Currently,  the  only  supported  type  is
          OPENSEARCH .

          Possible values:

          o OPENSEARCH

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       integrationName -> (string)
          The name of the integration that you just created.

       integrationStatus -> (string)
          The status of the integration that you just created.

          After you create an integration, it takes a few minutes to complete.
          During this time, you'll see the status as PROVISIONING .
