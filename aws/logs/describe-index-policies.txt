DESCRIBE-INDEX-POLICIES()                            DESCRIBE-INDEX-POLICIES()



NAME
       describe-index-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  field  index policies of one or more log groups. For more
       information about field index policies, see PutIndexPolicy .

       If a specified log group has a log-group level index policy, that  pol-
       icy is returned by this operation.

       If  a  specified log group doesn't have a log-group level index policy,
       but an account-wide index policy applies to it, that account-wide  pol-
       icy is returned by this operation.

       To   find   information   about   only   account-level   policies,  use
       DescribeAccountPolicies instead.

OPTIONS
       --log-group-identifiers (list)
          An array containing the name or ARN of the log group that  you  want
          to retrieve field index policies for.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. The token expires af-
          ter 24 hours.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       indexPolicies -> (list)
          An array containing the field index policies.

          (structure)
              This structure contains information about one field index policy
              in this account.

              logGroupIdentifier -> (string)
                 The ARN of the log group that this index policy applies to.

              lastUpdateTime -> (long)
                 The  date  and  time that this index policy was most recently
                 updated.

              policyDocument -> (string)
                 The policy document for this index policy, in JSON format.

              policyName -> (string)
                 The name of this  policy.  Responses  about  log  group-level
                 field  index  policies  don't  have this field, because those
                 policies don't have names.

              source -> (string)
                 This field indicates whether this is an  account-level  index
                 policy  or  an index policy that applies only to a single log
                 group.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. The token expires af-
          ter 24 hours.
