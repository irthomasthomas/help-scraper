CREATE-DELIVERY()                                            CREATE-DELIVERY()



NAME
       create-delivery -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  delivery . A delivery is a connection between a logical de-
       livery source and a logical delivery destination that you have  already
       created.

       Only  some  Amazon  Web Services services support being configured as a
       delivery source using this operation. These services are listed as Sup-
       ported  [V2  Permissions]  in the table at Enabling logging from Amazon
       Web Services services.

       A delivery destination can represent a log group in CloudWatch Logs, an
       Amazon S3 bucket, or a delivery stream in Firehose.

       To configure logs delivery between a supported Amazon Web Services ser-
       vice and a destination, you must do the following:

       o Create a delivery source, which is a logical object  that  represents
         the resource that is actually sending the logs. For more information,
         see PutDeliverySource .

       o Create a delivery destination , which is a logical object that repre-
         sents  the  actual  delivery  destination.  For more information, see
         PutDeliveryDestination .

       o If  you   are   delivering   logs   cross-account,   you   must   use
         PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy  in the destination account to assign an
         IAM policy to the destination. This policy allows  delivery  to  that
         destination.

       o Use CreateDelivery to create a delivery by pairing exactly one deliv-
         ery source and one delivery destination.

       You can configure a single delivery source to  send  logs  to  multiple
       destinations  by creating multiple deliveries. You can also create mul-
       tiple deliveries to configure multiple delivery sources to send logs to
       the same delivery destination.

       You  can't  update an existing delivery. You can only create and delete
       deliveries.

OPTIONS
       --delivery-source-name (string)
          The name of the delivery source to use for this delivery.

       --delivery-destination-arn (string)
          The ARN of the delivery destination to use for this delivery.

       --record-fields (list)
          The list of record fields to be delivered to the destination, in or-
          der.  If the deliverys log source has mandatory fields, they must be
          included in this list.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --field-delimiter (string)
          The field delimiter to use between record fields when the final out-
          put format of a delivery is in Plain , W3C , or Raw format.

       --s3-delivery-configuration (structure)
          This  structure contains parameters that are valid only when the de-
          liverys delivery destination is an S3 bucket.

          suffixPath -> (string)
              This string allows re-configuring the S3 object prefix  to  con-
              tain  either static or variable sections. The valid variables to
              use in the suffix path will vary by each log source. See Config-
              urationTemplate$allowedSuffixPathFields  for  more  info on what
              values are supported in the suffix path for each log source.

          enableHiveCompatiblePath -> (boolean)
              This parameter causes the S3 objects that contain delivered logs
              to  use  a  prefix  structure  that  allows for integration with
              Apache Hive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          suffixPath=string,enableHiveCompatiblePath=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "suffixPath": "string",
            "enableHiveCompatiblePath": true|false
          }

       --tags (map)
          An optional list of key-value pairs to associate with the resource.

          For more information about tagging, see Tagging Amazon Web  Services
          resources

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,

              enableHiveCompatiblePath -> (boolean)
                 This parameter causes the S3 objects that  contain  delivered
                 logs  to  use  a prefix structure that allows for integration
                 with Apache Hive.
