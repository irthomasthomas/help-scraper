OPTIONS
       --log-group-identifiers (list)
          An  array  containing  the  names or ARNs of the log groups that you
          want to retrieve field indexes for.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. The token expires af-
          ter 24 hours.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       fieldIndexes -> (list)
          An array containing the field index information.

          (structure)
              This  structure describes one log event field that is used as an
              index in at least one index policy in this account.

              logGroupIdentifier -> (string)
                 If this field index appears in an index policy  that  applies
                 only to a single log group, the ARN of that log group is dis-
                 played here.

              fieldIndexName -> (string)
                 The string that this field index matches.

              lastScanTime -> (long)
                 The most recent time that CloudWatch  Logs  scanned  ingested
                 log  events  to  search  for  this field index to improve the
                 speed of future CloudWatch Logs Insights queries that  search
                 for this field index.

              firstEventTime -> (long)
                 The time and date of the earliest log event that matches this
                 field index, after the index policy that contains it was cre-
                 ated.

              lastEventTime -> (long)
                 The  time  and date of the most recent log event that matches
                 this field index.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. The token expires af-
          ter 24 hours.
