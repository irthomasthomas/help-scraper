PUT-DELIVERY-DESTINATION-POLICY()            PUT-DELIVERY-DESTINATION-POLICY()



NAME
       put-delivery-destination-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates and assigns an IAM policy that grants permissions to CloudWatch
       Logs to deliver logs cross-account to a specified destination  in  this
       account.  To configure the delivery of logs from an Amazon Web Services
       service in another account to a logs delivery destination in  the  cur-
       rent account, you must do the following:

       o Create  a  delivery source, which is a logical object that represents
         the resource that is actually sending the logs. For more information,
         see PutDeliverySource .

       o Create a delivery destination , which is a logical object that repre-
         sents the actual delivery  destination.  For  more  information,  see
         PutDeliveryDestination .

       o Use this operation in the destination account to assign an IAM policy
         to the destination. This policy allows delivery to that destination.

       o Create a delivery by pairing exactly one delivery source and one  de-
         livery destination. For more information, see CreateDelivery .

       Only  some  Amazon  Web Services services support being configured as a
       delivery source. These services are listed  as  Supported  [V2  Permis-
       sions]  in  the table at Enabling logging from Amazon Web Services ser-
       vices.

       The contents of the policy must include two statements.  One  statement
       enables  general  logs  delivery,  and the other allows delivery to the
       chosen destination. See the examples for the needed policies.

OPTIONS
       --delivery-destination-name (string)
          The name of the delivery destination to assign this policy to.

       --delivery-destination-policy (string)
          The contents of the policy.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       rides config/env settings.
