OPTIONS
       --anomaly-detector-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of the anomaly detector to retrieve information about. You
          can find the ARNs of log anomaly detectors in your account by  using
          the ListLogAnomalyDetectors operation.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       detectorName -> (string)
          The name of the log anomaly detector

       logGroupArnList -> (list)
          An array of structures, where each structure contains the ARN  of  a
          log group associated with this anomaly detector.

          (string)

       evaluationFrequency -> (string)
          Specifies  how  often  the anomaly detector runs and look for anoma-
          lies. Set this value according to the frequency that the  log  group
          receives  new  logs.  For example, if the log group receives new log
          events every 10 minutes, then setting  evaluationFrequency  to  FIF-
          TEEN_MIN might be appropriate.

       filterPattern -> (string)
          A  symbolic  description of how CloudWatch Logs should interpret the
          data in each log event. For example, a log event can  contain  time-
          stamps, IP addresses, strings, and so on. You use the filter pattern
          to specify what to look for in the log event message.

       anomalyDetectorStatus -> (string)
          Specifies whether the  anomaly  detector  is  currently  active.  To
          change    its   status,   use   the   enabled   parameter   in   the
          UpdateLogAnomalyDetector operation.

       kmsKeyId -> (string)
          The ID of the KMS key assigned to this anomaly detector, if any.

       creationTimeStamp -> (long)
          The date and time when this anomaly detector was created.

       lastModifiedTimeStamp -> (long)
          The date and time when this anomaly detector was most recently modi-
          fied.

       anomalyVisibilityTime -> (long)
          The  number  of days used as the life cycle of anomalies. After this
          time, anomalies are automatically baselined and the anomaly detector
          model will treat new occurrences of similar event as normal.
