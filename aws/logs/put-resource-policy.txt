DESCRIPTION
       Creates or updates a resource policy allowing other Amazon Web Services

       account can have up to 10 resource policies per Amazon Web Services Re-
       gion.

OPTIONS
       --policy-name (string)
          Name of the new policy. This parameter is required.

       --policy-document (string)
          Details of the new policy, including the identity of  the  principal
          that  is enabled to put logs to this account. This is formatted as a
          JSON string. This parameter is required.

          The following example creates a resource policy enabling  the  Route
          53  service to put DNS query logs in to the specified log group. Re-
          place "logArn" with the ARN of your CloudWatch Logs  resource,  such
          as a log group or log stream.

          CloudWatch  Logs  also  supports aws:SourceArn and aws:SourceAccount
          condition context keys.

          In the example resource policy,  you  would  replace  the  value  of
          SourceArn  with the resource making the call from Route 53 to Cloud-
          Watch Logs. You would also replace the value of  SourceAccount  with
          the Amazon Web Services account ID making that call.
              {    "Version":    "2012-10-17",   "Statement":   [   {   "Sid":
              "Route53LogsToCloudWatchLogs", "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": {
              "Service": [ "route53.amazonaws.com" ] }, "Action": "logs:PutLo-
              gEvents", "Resource":  "logArn",  "Condition":  {  "ArnLike":  {
              "aws:SourceArn":  "myRoute53ResourceArn"  },  "StringEquals":  {
              "aws:SourceAccount": "myAwsAccountId" } } } ] }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
