PUT-SUBSCRIPTION-FILTER()                            PUT-SUBSCRIPTION-FILTER()



NAME
       put-subscription-filter -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or  updates  a  subscription filter and associates it with the
       specified log group. With subscription filters, you can subscribe to  a
       real-time  stream  of log events ingested through PutLogEvents and have
       them delivered to a specific destination. When log events are  sent  to
       the  receiving service, they are Base64 encoded and compressed with the
       GZIP format.

       The following destinations are supported for subscription filters:

       o An Amazon Kinesis data stream belonging to the same  account  as  the
         subscription filter, for same-account delivery.

       o A  logical  destination created with PutDestination that belongs to a
         different account, for cross-account delivery. We  currently  support
         Kinesis Data Streams and Firehose as logical destinations.

       o An  Amazon  Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream that belongs to the
         same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.

       o An Lambda function that belongs to the same account as the  subscrip-
         tion filter, for same-account delivery.

       Each  log group can have up to two subscription filters associated with
       it. If you are updating an existing filter, you must specify  the  cor-
       rect name in filterName .

       To perform a PutSubscriptionFilter operation for any destination except
       a Lambda function, you must also have the iam:PassRole permission.

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group.

       --filter-name (string)
          A name for the subscription filter. If you are updating an  existing
          filter,  you  must  specify the correct name in filterName . To find
          the name of the filter currently associated with a  log  group,  use
          DescribeSubscriptionFilters .

       --filter-pattern (string)
          A filter pattern for subscribing to a filtered stream of log events.

       --destination-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of the destination to deliver matching log events to. Cur-
          rently, the supported destinations are:

          o An Amazon Kinesis stream belonging to the same account as the sub-
            scription filter, for same-account delivery.

          o A logical destination (specified using an ARN) belonging to a dif-
            ferent account, for cross-account delivery. If you're setting up a
            cross-account  subscription, the destination must have an IAM pol-
            icy associated with it. The IAM policy must allow  the  sender  to
            send   logs   to   the  destination.  For  more  information,  see
            PutDestinationPolicy .

          o A Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream belonging to the same  ac-
            count as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.

          o A  Lambda  function belonging to the same account as the subscrip-
            tion filter, for same-account delivery.

       --role-arn (string)
          The ARN of an IAM role that grants CloudWatch  Logs  permissions  to
          deliver  ingested  log  events  to the destination stream. You don't
          need to provide the ARN when you are working with a logical destina-
          tion for cross-account delivery.

       --distribution (string)
          The  method  used  to distribute log data to the destination. By de-
          fault, log data is grouped by log stream, but the  grouping  can  be
          set  to  random  for a more even distribution. This property is only
          applicable when the destination is an Amazon Kinesis data stream.

          Possible values:

          o Random

          o ByLogStream

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       None
