GET-LOG-GROUP-FIELDS()                                  GET-LOG-GROUP-FIELDS()



NAME
       get-log-group-fields -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  the fields that are included in log events in the
       specified log group. Includes the percentage of log events that contain
       each field. The search is limited to a time period that you specify.

       You can specify the log group to search by using either logGroupIdenti-
       fier or logGroupName . You must specify one of  these  parameters,  but
       you can't specify both.

       In the results, fields that start with @ are fields generated by Cloud-
       Watch Logs. For example, @timestamp is the timestamp of each log event.
       For  more information about the fields that are generated by CloudWatch
       logs, see Supported Logs and Discovered Fields .

       The response results are sorted by the frequency  percentage,  starting
       with the highest percentage.

       If  you  are  using CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can use
       this operation in a monitoring account and view data  from  the  linked
       source accounts. For more information, see CloudWatch cross-account ob-
       servability .

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group to search.

          NOTE:
              You must include either logGroupIdentifier or logGroupName , but
              not both.

       --time (long)
          The  time  to  set as the center of the query. If you specify time ,
          the 8 minutes before and 8 minutes after this time are searched.  If
          you  omit  time  , the most recent 15 minutes up to the current time
          are searched.

          The time value is specified as epoch time, which is  the  number  of
          seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC .

       --log-group-identifier (string)
          Specify  either the name or ARN of the log group to view. If the log
          group is in a source account and you are using a monitoring account,
          you must specify the ARN.

          NOTE:
              You must include either logGroupIdentifier or logGroupName , but
              not both.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       logGroupFields -> (list)
          The array of fields found in the query. Each  object  in  the  array
          contains the name of the field, along with the percentage of time it
          appeared in the log events that were queried.

          (structure)
              The fields contained in log events found by a  GetLogGroupFields
              operation,  along  with  the percentage of queried log events in
              which each field appears.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of a log field.

              percent -> (integer)
                 The percentage of  log  events  queried  that  contained  the
                 field.
