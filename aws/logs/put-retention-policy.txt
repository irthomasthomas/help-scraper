PUT-RETENTION-POLICY()                                  PUT-RETENTION-POLICY()



NAME
       put-retention-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets the retention of the specified log group. With a retention policy,
       you can configure the number of days for which to retain log events  in
       the specified log group.

       NOTE:
          CloudWatch  Logs  doesn't  immediately  delete  log events when they
          reach their retention setting. It typically takes up to 72 hours af-
          ter that before log events are deleted, but in rare situations might
          take longer.

          To illustrate, imagine that you change a log group to have a  longer
          retention  setting when it contains log events that are past the ex-
          piration date, but haven't been deleted. Those log events will  take
          up  to  72  hours  to  be  deleted  after  the new retention date is
          reached. To make sure that log data is deleted permanently,  keep  a
          log  group  at  its lower retention setting until 72 hours after the
          previous retention period ends. Alternatively, wait  to  change  the
          retention  setting until you confirm that the earlier log events are
          deleted.

          When log events reach their retention setting they  are  marked  for
          deletion.  After  they  are  marked for deletion, they do not add to
          your archival storage costs anymore, even if they are  not  actually
          deleted  until  later. These log events marked for deletion are also
          not included when you use an API to retrieve the  storedBytes  value
          to see how many bytes a log group is storing.

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group.

       --retention-in-days (integer)
          The  number  of  days  to retain the log events in the specified log
          group. Possible values are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 30, 60,  90,  120,  150,
          180,  365,  400,  545,  731, 1096, 1827, 2192, 2557, 2922, 3288, and
          3653.

          To set a log group so  that  its  log  events  do  not  expire,  use
          DeleteRetentionPolicy .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command adds a 5 day retention  policy  to  a  log  group
       named my-logs:

          aws logs put-retention-policy --log-group-name my-logs --retention-in-days 5

OUTPUT
       None
