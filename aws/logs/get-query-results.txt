GET-QUERY-RESULTS()                                        GET-QUERY-RESULTS()



NAME
       get-query-results -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the results from the specified query.

       Only  the fields requested in the query are returned, along with a @ptr
       field, which is the identifier for the log  record.  You  can  use  the
       value of @ptr in a GetLogRecord operation to get the full log record.
          GetQueryResults  does not start running a query. To run a query, use
          StartQuery . For more information about how long results of previous
          queries are available, see CloudWatch Logs quotas .

       If the value of the Status field in the output is Running , this opera-
       tion returns only partial results. If you see a value of  Scheduled  or
       Running  for  the  status, you can retry the operation later to see the
       final results.

       If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability,  you  can  use
       this  operation  in  a  monitoring  account  to start queries in linked
       source accounts. For more information, see CloudWatch cross-account ob-
       servability .

          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

OPTIONS
       --query-id (string)
          The ID number of the query.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       queryLanguage -> (string)
          The  query  language used for this query. For more information about
          the query languages that CloudWatch  Logs  supports,  see  Supported
          query languages .

       results -> (list)
          The  log  events that matched the query criteria during the most re-
          cent time it ran.

          The results value is an array of arrays. Each log event is  one  ob-
          ject  in  the top-level array. Each of these log event objects is an
          array of field /value pairs.

          (list)
              (structure)
                 Contains one field from one log event returned  by  a  Cloud-
                 Watch  Logs  Insights  query,  along  with  the value of that
                 field.

                 For more information about the fields that are  generated  by
                 CloudWatch logs, see Supported Logs and Discovered Fields .

                 field -> (string)
                     The log event field.

                 value -> (string)
                     The value of this field.

       statistics -> (structure)
          Includes  the  number of log events scanned by the query, the number
          of log events that matched the query criteria, and the total  number
          of  bytes  in  the scanned log events. These values reflect the full
          raw results of the query.

          recordsMatched -> (double)
              The number of log events that matched the query string.

          recordsScanned -> (double)
              The total number of log events scanned during the query.

          estimatedRecordsSkipped -> (double)
              An estimate of the number of log events that were  skipped  when
              processing  this  query,  because the query contained an indexed
              field. Skipping these entries lowers query  costs  and  improves
              the query performance time. For more information about field in-
              dexes, see PutIndexPolicy .

          bytesScanned -> (double)
              The total number of bytes in the log events scanned  during  the
              query.

          estimatedBytesSkipped -> (double)
              An  estimate  of the number of bytes in the log events that were
              skipped when processing this query, because the query  contained
              an  indexed field. Skipping these entries lowers query costs and
              improves the query performance time. For more information  about
              field indexes, see PutIndexPolicy .

          logGroupsScanned -> (double)
              The number of log groups that were scanned by this query.

       status -> (string)
          The  status of the most recent running of the query. Possible values
          are Cancelled , Complete , Failed , Running , Scheduled , Timeout  ,
          and Unknown .

          Queries  time  out after 60 minutes of runtime. To avoid having your
          queries time out, reduce the time range being searched or  partition
          your query into a number of queries.

       encryptionKey -> (string)
          If you associated an KMS key with the CloudWatch Logs Insights query
          results in this account, this field displays  the  ARN  of  the  key
          that's  used  to  encrypt  the  query results when StartQuery stores
          them.
