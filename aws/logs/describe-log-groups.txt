DESCRIBE-LOG-GROUPS()                                    DESCRIBE-LOG-GROUPS()



NAME
       describe-log-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  specified  log  groups. You can list all your log groups or
       filter the results by prefix. The results are ASCII-sorted by log group
       name.

       CloudWatch  Logs doesnt support IAM policies that control access to the
       DescribeLogGroups action by using the
       ``
       aws:ResourceTag/key-name `` condition key. Other  CloudWatch  Logs  ac-
       tions do support the use of the
       ``
       aws:ResourceTag/key-name  ``  condition key to control access. For more
       information about using tags to control access, see Controlling  access
       to Amazon Web Services resources using tags .

       System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 22)
              Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 22)
              Inline literal start-string without end-string.

              If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can
              use this operation in a monitoring account and  view  data  from
              the linked source accounts. For more information, see CloudWatch
              cross-account observability .

              See also: AWS API Documentation

              describe-log-groups is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
              may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
              sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate
              argument.   When using --output text and the --query argument on
              a paginated response, the --query  argument  must  extract  data
              from the results of the following query expressions: logGroups

OPTIONS
       --account-identifiers (list)
          When  includeLinkedAccounts  is  set to True , use this parameter to
          specify the list of accounts to search. You can specify as  many  as
          20 account IDs in the array.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --log-group-name-prefix (string)
          The prefix to match.

          NOTE:
              logGroupNamePrefix  and  logGroupNamePattern are mutually exclu-
              sive. Only one of these parameters can be passed.

       --log-group-name-pattern (string)
          If you specify a string for this parameter,  the  operation  returns
          only  log  groups  that  have names that match the string based on a
          case-sensitive substring search. For example, if you specify  Foo  ,
          log  groups  named  FooBar , aws/Foo , and GroupFoo would match, but
          foo , F/o/o and Froo would not match.

          If you specify logGroupNamePattern in your request, then only arn  ,
          creationTime , and logGroupName are included in the response.

          NOTE:
              logGroupNamePattern  and  logGroupNamePrefix are mutually exclu-
              sive. Only one of these parameters can be passed.

       --include-linked-accounts | --no-include-linked-accounts (boolean)
          If you are using a monitoring account, set this to True to have  the
          operation return log groups in the accounts listed in accountIdenti-
          fiers .

          If this parameter is set to true and accountIdentifiers  contains  a
          null  value,  the operation returns all log groups in the monitoring
          account and all log groups in all source accounts that are linked to
          the monitoring account.

       --log-group-class (string)
          Specifies  the  log  group  class  for this log group. There are two
          classes:

          o The Standard log class supports all CloudWatch Logs features.

          o The Infrequent Access log class supports a  subset  of  CloudWatch
            Logs features and incurs lower costs.

          For  details  about  the  features  supported by each class, see Log
          classes

          Possible values:

          o STANDARD

          o INFREQUENT_ACCESS

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command describes a log group named my-logs:

          aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix my-logs

       Output:

          {
              "logGroups": [
                  {
                      "storedBytes": 0,
                      "metricFilterCount": 0,
                      "creationTime": 1433189500783,
                      "logGroupName": "my-logs",
                      "retentionInDays": 5,
                      "arn": "arn:aws:logs:us-west-2:0123456789012:log-group:my-logs:*"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       logGroups -> (list)
          The log groups.

          If the retentionInDays value is not included for a log  group,  then
          that log group's events do not expire.

          (structure)
              Represents a log group.

              logGroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the log group.

              creationTime -> (long)
                 The  creation  time of the log group, expressed as the number
                 of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

              retentionInDays -> (integer)
                 The number of days to retain the log events in the  specified
                 log  group.  Possible values are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90,
                 120, 150, 180, 365, 400, 545, 731, 1096,  1827,  2192,  2557,
                 2922, 3288, and 3653.

                 To  set a log group so that its log events do not expire, use
                 DeleteRetentionPolicy .

              metricFilterCount -> (integer)
                 The number of metric filters.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the log group. This version
                 of the ARN includes a trailing :* after the log group name.

                 Use  this  version  to  refer to the ARN in IAM policies when
                 specifying permissions for most API actions. The exception is
                 when specifying permissions for TagResource , UntagResource ,
                 and ListTagsForResource . The permissions for those three ac-
                 tions require the ARN version that doesn't include a trailing
                 :* .

              storedBytes -> (long)
                 The number of bytes stored.

              kmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key to use when en-
                 crypting log data.

              dataProtectionStatus -> (string)
                 Displays  whether  this log group has a protection policy, or
                 whether it had one in the past.  For  more  information,  see

                 from account-level settings.

                 (string)

              logGroupClass -> (string)
                 This specifies the log group class for this log group.  There
                 are two classes:

                 o The  Standard  log  class supports all CloudWatch Logs fea-
                   tures.

                 o The Infrequent Access log class supports a subset of Cloud-
                   Watch Logs features and incurs lower costs.

                 For  details  about the features supported by each class, see
                 Log classes

              logGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the log group. This version
                 of  the ARN doesn't include a trailing :* after the log group
                 name.

                 Use this version to refer to the ARN in the following  situa-
                 tions:

                 o In  the  logGroupIdentifier  input field in many CloudWatch
                   Logs APIs.

                 o In the resourceArn field in tagging APIs

                 o In  IAM   policies,   when   specifying   permissions   for
                   TagResource , UntagResource , and ListTagsForResource .

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. The token expires af-
          ter 24 hours.
