LIST-LOG-ANOMALY-DETECTORS()                      LIST-LOG-ANOMALY-DETECTORS()



NAME
       list-log-anomaly-detectors -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a list of the log anomaly detectors in the account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-log-anomaly-detectors is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: anomalyDetectors

OPTIONS
       --filter-log-group-arn (string)
          Use this to optionally filter the results to  only  include  anomaly
          detectors that are associated with the specified log group.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       anomalyDetectors -> (list)
          An array of structures, where each structure in the  array  contains
          information about one anomaly detector.

          (structure)
              Contains information about one anomaly detector in the account.

              anomalyDetectorArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the anomaly detector.

              detectorName -> (string)
                 The name of the anomaly detector.

              logGroupArnList -> (list)
                 A list of the ARNs of the log groups that this anomaly detec-
                 tor watches.

                 (string)

              evaluationFrequency -> (string)
                 Specifies how often the anomaly detector runs  and  look  for
                 anomalies.

              filterPattern -> (string)
                 A  symbolic  description of how CloudWatch Logs should inter-
                 pret the data in each log event. For example, a log event can
                 contain timestamps, IP addresses, strings, and so on. You use
                 the filter pattern to specify what to look  for  in  the  log
                 event message.

              anomalyDetectorStatus -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  current  status  of  the anomaly detector. To
                 pause an anomaly detector, use the enabled parameter  in  the
                 UpdateLogAnomalyDetector operation.

              kmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the KMS key assigned to this anomaly detector, if
                 any.

              creationTimeStamp -> (long)
                 The date and time when this anomaly detector was created.

              lastModifiedTimeStamp -> (long)
                 The date and time when this anomaly  detector  was  most  re-
                 cently modified.

              anomalyVisibilityTime -> (long)
                 The number of days used as the life cycle of anomalies. After
                 this time, anomalies  are  automatically  baselined  and  the
                 anomaly  detector model will treat new occurrences of similar
                 event as normal.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. The token expires af-
          ter 24 hours.
