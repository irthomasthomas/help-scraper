FILTER-LOG-EVENTS()                                        FILTER-LOG-EVENTS()



NAME
       filter-log-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists log events from the specified log group. You can list all the log
       events or filter the results using a filter pattern, a time range,  and
       the name of the log stream.

       By  default,  this operation returns as many log events as can fit in 1
       MB (up to 10,000 log events) or all the events found  within  the  time
       range  that you specify. If the results include a token, then there are
       more log events available, and you can get additional results by speci-
       fying  the  token in a subsequent call. This operation can return empty
       results while there are more log events available through the token.

       The returned log events are sorted by event  timestamp,  the  timestamp
       when  the event was ingested by CloudWatch Logs, and the ID of the Put-
       LogEvents request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       filter-log-events is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: events, searchedLogStreams

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group to search.

       --log-stream-names (list)
          Filters the results to only logs from the log streams in this list.

          If  you  specify a value for both logStreamNamePrefix and logStream-
          Names , the action returns an InvalidParameterException error.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --log-stream-name-prefix (string)
          Filters the results to include only events  from  log  streams  that
          have names starting with this prefix.

          If  you  specify a value for both logStreamNamePrefix and logStream-
          Names , but the value for logStreamNamePrefix does not match any log
          stream names specified in logStreamNames , the action returns an In-
          validParameterException error.

       --start-time (long)
          The start of the time range, expressed as the number of milliseconds
          after  Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. Events with a timestamp before this
          time are not returned.

       --end-time (long)
          The end of the time range, expressed as the number  of  milliseconds
          after  Jan  1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. Events with a timestamp later than
          this time are not returned.

       --filter-pattern (string)
          The filter pattern to use. For more information, see Filter and Pat-
          tern Syntax .

          If not provided, all the events are matched.

       --interleaved | --no-interleaved (boolean)
          If  the  value is true, the operation makes a best effort to provide
          responses that contain events from multiple log streams  within  the
          log  group, interleaved in a single response. If the value is false,
          all the matched log events in the  first  log  stream  are  searched
          first,  then those in the next log stream, and so on. The default is
          false.
              Important: Starting on June 17, 2019, this parameter is  ignored
              and  the value is assumed to be true. The response from this op-
              eration always interleaves  events  from  multiple  log  streams
              within a log group.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
