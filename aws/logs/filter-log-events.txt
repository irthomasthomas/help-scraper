FILTER-LOG-EVENTS()                                        FILTER-LOG-EVENTS()



NAME
       filter-log-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists log events from the specified log group. You can list all the log
       events or filter the results using a filter pattern, a time range,  and
       the name of the log stream.

       You must have the logs;FilterLogEvents permission to perform this oper-
       ation.

       You can specify the log group to search by using either logGroupIdenti-
       fier  or  logGroupName  . You must include one of these two parameters,
       but you can't include both.

       By default, this operation returns as many log events as can fit  in  1
       MB  (up to 10,000 log events) or all the events found within the speci-
       fied time range. If the results include a token, that means  there  are
       more log events available. You can get additional results by specifying
       the token in a subsequent call. This operation can return empty results
       while there are more log events available through the token.

       The  returned  log  events are sorted by event timestamp, the timestamp
       when the event was ingested by CloudWatch Logs, and the ID of the  Put-
       LogEvents request.

       If  you  are  using CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can use
       this operation in a monitoring account and view data  from  the  linked
       source accounts. For more information, see CloudWatch cross-account ob-
       servability .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       filter-log-events is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: events, searchedLogStreams

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group to search.

          NOTE:
              You must include either logGroupIdentifier or logGroupName , but
              not both.

       --log-group-identifier (string)
          Specify either the name or ARN of the log group to view  log  events
          from.  If  the  log group is in a source account and you are using a
          monitoring account, you must use the log group ARN.

          NOTE:
              You must include either logGroupIdentifier or logGroupName , but
              not both.

       --log-stream-names (list)
          Filters the results to only logs from the log streams in this list.

          If  you  specify a value for both logStreamNamePrefix and logStream-
          Names , the action returns an InvalidParameterException error.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --log-stream-name-prefix (string)
          Filters the results to include only events  from  log  streams  that
          have names starting with this prefix.

          If  you  specify a value for both logStreamNamePrefix and logStream-
          Names , but the value for logStreamNamePrefix does not match any log
          stream names specified in logStreamNames , the action returns an In-
          validParameterException error.

       --start-time (long)
          The start of the time range, expressed as the number of milliseconds
          after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC . Events with a timestamp before this
          time are not returned.

       --end-time (long)
          The end of the time range, expressed as the number  of  milliseconds
          after  Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC . Events with a timestamp later than
          this time are not returned.

       --filter-pattern (string)
          The filter pattern to use. For more information, see Filter and Pat-
          tern Syntax .

          If not provided, all the events are matched.

       --interleaved | --no-interleaved (boolean)
          If  the  value  is true, the operation attempts to provide responses
          that contain events from multiple log streams within the log  group,
          interleaved  in  a  single  response. If the value is false, all the
          matched log events in the first log stream are searched first,  then
          those in the next log stream, and so on.
              Important As of June 17, 2019, this parameter is ignored and the
              value is assumed to be true. The response  from  this  operation
              always interleaves events from multiple log streams within a log
              group.

       --unmask | --no-unmask (boolean)
          Specify true to display the log event fields with all sensitive data
          unmasked and visible. The default is false .

          To  use  this operation with this parameter, you must be signed into
          an account with the logs:Unmask permission.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
