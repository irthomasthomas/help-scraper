START-QUERY()                                                    START-QUERY()



NAME
       start-query -

DESCRIPTION
       Schedules  a  query  of a log group using CloudWatch Logs Insights. You
       specify the log group and time range to query and the query  string  to
       use.

       For more information, see CloudWatch Logs Insights Query Syntax .

       Queries  time  out  after  15 minutes of execution. If your queries are
       timing out, reduce the time range  being  searched  or  partition  your
       query into a number of queries.

       You  are limited to 20 concurrent CloudWatch Logs insights queries, in-
       cluding queries that have been added to dashboards.

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The log group on which to perform the query.

          A StartQuery operation must include a logGroupNames or  a  logGroup-
          Name parameter, but not both.

       --log-group-names (list)
          The  list  of log groups to be queried. You can include up to 20 log
          groups.

          A StartQuery operation must include a logGroupNames or  a  logGroup-
          Name parameter, but not both.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --start-time (long)
          The beginning of the time range to query. The range is inclusive, so
          the specified start time is included  in  the  query.  Specified  as
          epoch  time,  the  number of seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00
          UTC.

       --end-time (long)
          The end of the time range to query. The range is inclusive,  so  the
          specified  end  time  is  included  in the query. Specified as epoch
          time, the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC.

       --query-string (string)
          The query string to use. For more information, see  CloudWatch  Logs
          Insights Query Syntax .

       --limit (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  log  events to return in the query. If the
          query string uses the fields command, only the specified fields  and
          their values are returned. The default is 1000.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       queryId -> (string)
          The unique ID of the query.
