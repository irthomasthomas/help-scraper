GET-LOG-EVENTS()                                              GET-LOG-EVENTS()



NAME
       get-log-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists log events from the specified log stream. You can list all of the
       log events or filter using a time range.

       By default, this operation returns as many log events as can fit  in  a
       response  size of 1MB (up to 10,000 log events). You can get additional
       log events by specifying one of the tokens in a subsequent  call.  This
       operation  can  return  empty  results  while there are more log events
       available through the token.

       If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability,  you  can  use
       this  operation  in  a monitoring account and view data from the linked
       source accounts. For more information, see CloudWatch cross-account ob-
       servability .

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group.

          NOTE:
              If  you specify values for both logGroupName and logGroupIdenti-
              fier , the action returns an InvalidParameterException error.

       --log-group-identifier (string)
          Specify either the name or ARN of the log group to view events from.
          If the log group is in a source account and you are using a monitor-
          ing account, you must use the log group ARN.

          If you specify values for both logGroupName and logGroupIdentifier ,
          the action returns an InvalidParameterException error.

       --log-stream-name (string)
          The name of the log stream.

       --start-time (long)
          The start of the time range, expressed as the number of milliseconds
          after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC . Events with a  timestamp  equal  to
          this  time or later than this time are included. Events with a time-
          stamp earlier than this time are not included.

       --end-time (long)
          The end of the time range, expressed as the number  of  milliseconds
          after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC . Events with a timestamp equal to or
          later than this time are not included.

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return.  (You  received  this
          token from a previous call.)

       --limit (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of log events returned. If you don't specify a
          limit, the default is as many log events as can fit  in  a  response
          size of 1 MB (up to 10,000 log events).

       --start-from-head | --no-start-from-head (boolean)
          If the value is true, the earliest log events are returned first. If
          the value is false, the latest log events are  returned  first.  The
          default value is false.

          If  you are using a previous nextForwardToken value as the nextToken
          in this operation, you must specify true for startFromHead .

       --unmask | --no-unmask (boolean)
          Specify true to display the log event fields with all sensitive data
          unmasked and visible. The default is false .

          To  use  this operation with this parameter, you must be signed into
          an account with the logs:Unmask permission.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              Represents a log event.

              timestamp -> (long)
                 The  time the event occurred, expressed as the number of mil-
                 liseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC .

              message -> (string)

          stream, it returns the same token you passed in.

       nextBackwardToken -> (string)
          The  token  for the next set of items in the backward direction. The
          token expires after 24 hours. This token is not null.  If  you  have
