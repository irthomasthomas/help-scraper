PUT-INDEX-POLICY()                                          PUT-INDEX-POLICY()



NAME
       put-index-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or  updates  a field index policy for the specified log group.
       Only log groups in the Standard log class support field index policies.
       For more information about log classes, see Log classes .

       You  can  use  field  index  policies to create field indexes on fields
       found in log events in the log group. Creating field indexes speeds  up
       and  lowers  the costs for CloudWatch Logs Insights queries that refer-
       ence those field indexes, because these queries  attempt  to  skip  the
       processing of log events that are known to not match the indexed field.
       Good fields to index are fields that you often need to  query  for  and
       fields  or  values  that  match  only a small fraction of the total log
       events. Common examples of indexes  include  request  ID,  session  ID,
       userID,  and  instance  IDs. For more information, see Create field in-
       dexes to improve query performance and reduce costs .

       To find the  fields  that  are  in  your  log  group  events,  use  the
       GetLogGroupFields operation.

       For  example,  suppose  you  have created a field index for requestId .
       Then, any CloudWatch Logs Insights query on that  log  group  that  in-
       cludes  requestId  =  *value* `` or ``requestId IN [*value* , *value* ,
       ...] will process fewer log events to reduce costs, and  have  improved
       performance.

       Each index policy has the following quotas and restrictions:

       o As many as 20 fields can be included in the policy.

       o Each field name can include as many as 100 characters.

       Matches  of  log  events to the names of indexed fields are case-sensi-
       tive. For example, a field index of RequestId won't match a  log  event
       containing requestId .

       Log  group-level field index policies created with PutIndexPolicy over-
       ride account-level field index policies created with PutAccountPolicy .
       If  you  use  PutIndexPolicy  to  create a field index policy for a log
       group, that log group uses only that policy. The log group ignores  any
       account-wide field index policy that you might have created.

OPTIONS
       --log-group-identifier (string)
          Specify  either  the  log  group name or log group ARN to apply this
          field index policy to.  If  you  specify  an  ARN,  use  the  format
          arn:aws:logs:region  :account-id :log-group:log_group_name Don't in-
          clude an * at the end.

       --policy-document (string)
          The index policy document, in JSON format. The following is an exam-
          ple  of an index policy document that creates two indexes, RequestId
          and TransactionId .
              "policyDocument": "{ "Fields": [ "RequestId", "TransactionId"  ]
              }"

          The  policy document must include at least one field index. For more
          information about the fields that can be included and other restric-
          tions, see Field index syntax and quotas .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       indexPolicy -> (structure)
          The index policy that you just created or updated.

          logGroupIdentifier -> (string)
              The ARN of the log group that this index policy applies to.

          lastUpdateTime -> (long)
              The  date  and time that this index policy was most recently up-
              dated.

          policyDocument -> (string)
              The policy document for this index policy, in JSON format.

          policyName -> (string)
              The name of this policy. Responses about log  group-level  field
              index  policies  don't  have  this field, because those policies
              don't have names.

          source -> (string)
              This field indicates whether this is an account-level index pol-
              icy or an index policy that applies only to a single log group.
