PUT-DATA-PROTECTION-POLICY()                      PUT-DATA-PROTECTION-POLICY()



NAME
       put-data-protection-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  data  protection policy for the specified log group. A data
       protection policy can help safeguard sensitive data that's ingested  by
       the log group by auditing and masking the sensitive log data.

       WARNING:
          Sensitive  data  is detected and masked when it is ingested into the
          log group. When you set a data protection  policy,  log  events  in-
          gested into the log group before that time are not masked.

       By  default,  when  a user views a log event that includes masked data,
       the sensitive data is  replaced  by  asterisks.  A  user  who  has  the
       logs:Unmask permission can use a GetLogEvents or FilterLogEvents opera-
       tion with the unmask parameter set to true to  view  the  unmasked  log
       events.  Users  with the logs:Unmask can also view unmasked data in the
       CloudWatch Logs console by running a  CloudWatch  Logs  Insights  query
       with the unmask query command.

       For more information, including a list of types of data that can be au-
       dited and masked, see Protect sensitive log data with masking .

       The PutDataProtectionPolicy operation applies to only the specified log
       group.  You  can  also  use PutAccountPolicy to create an account-level
       data protection policy that applies to all log groups in  the  account,
       including  both  existing  log  groups  and log groups that are created
       level. If a log group has its own data protection policy  and  the  ac-
       count  also  has  an account-level data protection policy, then the two
       policies are cumulative. Any sensitive term specified in either  policy
       is masked.

OPTIONS
       --log-group-identifier (string)
          Specify either the log group name or log group ARN.

       --policy-document (string)
          Specify the data protection policy, in JSON.

          This policy must include two JSON blocks:

          o The first block must include both a DataIdentifer array and an Op-
            eration property with an Audit  action.  The  DataIdentifer  array
            lists  the types of sensitive data that you want to mask. For more
            information about the available options, see Types  of  data  that
            you  can mask . The Operation property with an Audit action is re-
            quired to find the sensitive data terms. This  Audit  action  must
            contain  a FindingsDestination object. You can optionally use that
            FindingsDestination object to list one  or  more  destinations  to
            send  audit  findings  to. If you specify destinations such as log
            groups, Firehose streams, and S3 buckets, they must already exist.

          o The second block must include both a DataIdentifer  array  and  an
            Operation  property  with  an Deidentify action. The DataIdentifer
            array must exactly match the  DataIdentifer  array  in  the  first
            block  of  the  policy. The Operation property with the Deidentify
            action is what actually masks the data, and it  must  contain  the
            "MaskConfig":  {}  object.  The  "MaskConfig":  {}  object must be
            empty.

          For an example data protection policy, see the Examples  section  on
          this page.

          WARNING:
              The contents of the two DataIdentifer arrays must match exactly.

          In  addition to the two JSON blocks, the policyDocument can also in-
          clude Name , Description , and Version fields. The Name is used as a
          dimension  when  CloudWatch  Logs  reports audit findings metrics to
          CloudWatch.

          The JSON specified in policyDocument can be up to 30,720 characters.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       logGroupIdentifier -> (string)
          The log group name or ARN that you specified in your request.

       policyDocument -> (string)
          The data protection policy used for this log group.

       lastUpdatedTime -> (long)
          The date and time that this policy was most recently updated.
