NAME
       cognito-idp -

DESCRIPTION
       With  the  Amazon  Cognito user pools API, you can configure user pools
       and authenticate users. To authenticate users from third-party identity
       providers  (IdPs)  in  this  API, you can link IdP users to native user
       profiles . Learn more about the  authentication  and  authorization  of
       federated  users  at Adding user pool sign-in through a third party and
       in the User pool federation endpoints and hosted UI reference .

       This API reference provides detailed information about  API  operations
       and object types in Amazon Cognito.

       Along  with  resource  management  operations,  the Amazon Cognito user
       pools API includes classes of operations and authorization  models  for
       client-side  and  server-side authentication of users. You can interact
       with operations in the Amazon Cognito user pools API as any of the fol-
       lowing subjects.

       o An  administrator  who  wants  to  configure user pools, app clients,
         users, groups, or other user pool functions.

       o A server-side app, like a web application, that wants to use its Ama-
         zon  Web  Services privileges to manage, authenticate, or authorize a
         user.

       o A client-side app, like a mobile app, that wants to make  unauthenti-
         cated requests to manage, authenticate, or authorize a user.

       For  more  information, see Using the Amazon Cognito user pools API and
       user pool endpoints in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

       With your Amazon Web Services SDK, you can build the logic  to  support
       operational flows in every use case for this API. You can also make di-
       rect REST API requests to Amazon Cognito user pools service endpoints .
