VALIDATE-E911-ADDRESS()                                VALIDATE-E911-ADDRESS()



NAME
       validate-e911-address -

DESCRIPTION
       Validates  an  address  to be used for 911 calls made with Amazon Chime
       SDK Voice Connectors. You can use validated addresses in a Presence In-
       formation  Data Format Location Object file that you include in SIP re-
       quests. That helps ensure that addresses are routed to the  appropriate
       Public Safety Answering Point.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON

       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
