OPTIONS
       --voice-connector-id (string)
          The Voice Connector ID.

       --origination (structure)
          The origination settings being updated.

          Routes -> (list)
              The  call  distribution  properties  defined for your SIP hosts.
              Valid range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 20.  This  pa-
              rameter  is not required, but you must specify this parameter or
              Disabled .

              (structure)
                 Origination routes define call  distribution  properties  for
                 your SIP hosts to receive inbound calls using an Amazon Chime
                 SDK Voice Connector. Limit: Ten origination routes  for  each
                 Voice Connector.

                 NOTE:
                     The  parameters  listed  below  are not required, but you
                     must use at least one.

                 Host -> (string)
                     The FQDN or IP address to contact for  origination  traf-
                     fic.

                 Port -> (integer)
                     The designated origination route port. Defaults to 5060.

                 Protocol -> (string)
                     The  protocol  to  use for the origination route. Encryp-
                     tion-enabled Amazon Chime SDK Voice  Connectors  use  TCP
                     protocol by default.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     The  priority  associated with the host, with 1 being the
                     highest priority. Higher  priority  hosts  are  attempted
                     first.

                 Weight -> (integer)
                     The  weight  assigned to an origination route. When hosts
                     have equal priority, calls are distributed  between  them
                     based on their relative weights.

          Disabled -> (boolean)
              When  origination  settings  are disabled, inbound calls are not
              enabled for your Amazon Chime SDK Voice Connector. This  parame-
              ter  is  not  required,  but  you must specify this parameter or
              Routes .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Routes=[{Host=string,Port=integer,Protocol=string,Priority=integer,Weight=integer},{Host=string,Port=integer,Protocol=string,Priority=integer,Weight=integer}],Disabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Routes": [
              {
                "Host": "string",
                "Port": integer,
                "Protocol": "TCP"|"UDP",
                "Priority": integer,
                "Weight": integer
              }
              ...
            ],
            "Disabled": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Origination -> (structure)
          The updated origination settings.

          Routes -> (list)
              The call distribution properties defined  for  your  SIP  hosts.
              Valid  range:  Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 20. This pa-
              rameter is not required, but you must specify this parameter  or
              Disabled .

              (structure)
                 Origination  routes  define  call distribution properties for
                 your SIP hosts to receive inbound calls using an Amazon Chime
                 SDK  Voice  Connector. Limit: Ten origination routes for each
                 Voice Connector.

                 NOTE:
                     The parameters listed below are  not  required,  but  you
                     must use at least one.

                 Host -> (string)
                     The  FQDN  or IP address to contact for origination traf-
                     fic.

                 Port -> (integer)
                     The designated origination route port. Defaults to 5060.

                 Protocol -> (string)
                     The protocol to use for the  origination  route.  Encryp-
                     tion-enabled  Amazon  Chime  SDK Voice Connectors use TCP
                     protocol by default.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     The priority associated with the host, with 1  being  the
                     highest  priority.  Higher  priority  hosts are attempted
                     first.

                 Weight -> (integer)
                     The weight assigned to an origination route.  When  hosts
                     have  equal  priority, calls are distributed between them
                     based on their relative weights.

          Disabled -> (boolean)
              When origination settings are disabled, inbound  calls  are  not
              enabled  for your Amazon Chime SDK Voice Connector. This parame-
              ter is not required, but you  must  specify  this  parameter  or
