CREATE-VOICE-CONNECTOR-GROUP()                  CREATE-VOICE-CONNECTOR-GROUP()



NAME
       create-voice-connector-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an Amazon Chime SDK Voice Connector group under the administra-
       tor's AWS account. You can associate Amazon Chime SDK Voice  Connectors
       with  the Voice Connector group by including VoiceConnectorItems in the
       request.

       You can include Voice Connectors from different  AWS  Regions  in  your
       group.  This creates a fault tolerant mechanism for fallback in case of
       availability events.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the Voice Connector group.

       --voice-connector-items (list)
          Lists the Voice Connectors that inbound calls are routed to.

          (structure)
              For Amazon Chime SDK Voice Connector groups,  the  Amazon  Chime
              SDK  Voice Connectors to which you route inbound calls. Includes
              priority configuration settings.  Limit:  3  VoiceConnectorItems
              per Voice Connector group.

              VoiceConnectorId -> (string)
                 The Voice Connector ID.

              Priority -> (integer)
                 The  priority  setting  of  a Voice Connector item. Calls are
                 routed to hosts in priority order, with 1 as the highest pri-
                 ority. When hosts have equal priority, the system distributes
                 calls among them based on their relative weight.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          VoiceConnectorId=string,Priority=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "VoiceConnectorId": "string",
              "Priority": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       VoiceConnectorGroup -> (structure)
          The details of the Voice Connector group.

          VoiceConnectorGroupId -> (string)
              The ID of a Voice Connector group.

          Name -> (string)

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     The priority setting of a Voice Connector item. Calls are
                     routed to hosts in priority order, with 1 as the  highest
                     priority. When hosts have equal priority, the system dis-
                     tributes calls among them based on their relative weight.
