OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the voice profile domain.

       --description (string)
          A description of the voice profile domain.

       --server-side-encryption-configuration (structure)
          The server-side encryption configuration for the request.

          KmsKeyArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the KMS key used to encrypt the enrollment data in  a
              voice  profile  domain. Asymmetric customer managed keys are not
              supported.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KmsKeyArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "KmsKeyArn": "string"
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          The unique identifier for the client request. Use a different  token
          for different domain creation requests.

       --tags (list)
          The tags assigned to the domain.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag applied to a resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag's key.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag's value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
