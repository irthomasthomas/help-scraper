OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the SIP rule.

       --trigger-type (string)
          The type of trigger assigned to the SIP rule in TriggerValue ,  cur-
          rently RequestUriHostname or ToPhoneNumber .

          Possible values:

          o ToPhoneNumber

          o RequestUriHostname

       --trigger-value (string)
          If TriggerType is RequestUriHostname , the value can be the outbound
          host name of a Voice Connector. If TriggerType  is  ToPhoneNumber  ,
          the  value  can be a customer-owned phone number in the E164 format.
          The SipMediaApplication specified in the SipRule is triggered if the
          request  URI  in an incoming SIP request matches the RequestUriHost-
          name , or if the To header in the incoming SIP request  matches  the
          ToPhoneNumber value.

       --disabled | --no-disabled (boolean)
          Disables  or  enables  a SIP rule. You must disable SIP rules before
          you can delete them.

       --target-applications (list)
          List of SIP media applications, with priority and AWS  Region.  Only
          one SIP application per AWS Region can be used.

          (structure)
              A target SIP media application and other details, such as prior-
              ity and AWS Region, to be specified in the SIP  rule.  Only  one
              SIP rule per AWS Region can be provided.

              SipMediaApplicationId -> (string)
                 The ID of a rule's target SIP media application.

              Priority -> (integer)
                 The  priority  setting  of a rule's target SIP media applica-
                 tion.

              AwsRegion -> (string)
                 The AWS Region of a rule's target SIP media application.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SipMediaApplicationId=string,Priority=integer,AwsRegion=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "SipMediaApplicationId": "string",
              "Priority": integer,
              "AwsRegion": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.
