DELETE-DATASET()                                              DELETE-DATASET()



NAME
       delete-dataset -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an existing Amazon Lookout for Vision dataset .

       If your the project has a single dataset, you must create a new dataset
       before you can create a model.

       If you project has a training dataset and a test dataset  consider  the
       following.

       o If  you  delete  the  test  dataset, your project reverts to a single
         dataset project. If you then train the model, Amazon Lookout for  Vi-
         sion internally splits the remaining dataset into a training and test
         dataset.

       o If you delete the  training  dataset,  you  must  create  a  training
         dataset before you can create a model.

       This   operation   requires   permissions  to  perform  the  lookoutvi-
       sion:DeleteDataset operation.

OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The name of the project that contains the dataset that you  want  to
          delete.

       --dataset-type (string)
          The  type  of  the  dataset  to  delete. Specify train to delete the
          training dataset. Specify test to delete the test dataset. To delete
          the dataset in a single dataset project, specify train .

       --client-token (string)
          ClientToken  is  an idempotency token that ensures a call to Delete-
          Dataset completes only once. You choose the value to pass. For exam-
          ple, An issue might prevent you from getting a response from Delete-
          Dataset . In this case, safely retry your call to  DeleteDataset  by
          using the same ClientToken parameter value.

          If  you  don't  supply a value for ClientToken , the AWS SDK you are
          using inserts a value for you. This prevents retries after a network
          error  from making multiple deletetion requests. You'll need to pro-
          vide your own value for other use cases.

          An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in
          the  first  request. Using a different value for ClientToken is con-
          sidered a new call to DeleteDataset . An idempotency token is active
          for 8 hours.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       o on

       o off

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
