START-MODEL-PACKAGING-JOB()                        START-MODEL-PACKAGING-JOB()



NAME
       start-model-packaging-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  an Amazon Lookout for Vision model packaging job. A model pack-
       aging job creates an AWS IoT Greengrass component for a Lookout for Vi-
       sion  model.  You can use the component to deploy your model to an edge
       device managed by Greengrass.

       Use the  DescribeModelPackagingJob API to determine the current  status
       of  the job. The model packaging job is complete if the value of Status
       is SUCCEEDED .

       To deploy the component to the target device, use  the  component  name
       and component version with the AWS IoT Greengrass CreateDeployment API.

       This operation requires the following permissions:

       o lookoutvision:StartModelPackagingJob

       o s3:PutObject

       o s3:GetBucketLocation

       o kms:GenerateDataKey

       o greengrass:CreateComponentVersion

       o greengrass:DescribeComponent

       o (Optional)  greengrass:TagResource . Only required if you want to tag
         the component.

       For more information, see Using your Amazon Lookout for Vision model on
       an edge device in the Amazon Lookout for Vision Developer Guide.

OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The name of the project which contains the version of the model that
          you want to package.

       --model-version (string)
          The version of the model within the project that you want  to  pack-
          age.

       --job-name (string)
          A name for the model packaging job. If you don't supply a value, the
          service creates a job name for you.

       --configuration (structure)
          The configuration for the model packaging job.

          Greengrass -> (structure)
              Configuration information for the AWS IoT  Greengrass  component
              in a model packaging job.

              CompilerOptions -> (string)
                 Additional  compiler  options  for  the Greengrass component.
                 Currently, only NVIDIA Graphics Processing  Units  (GPU)  and
                 CPU accelerators are supported. If you specify TargetDevice ,
                 don't specify CompilerOptions .

                 For more information, see  Compiler  options  in  the  Amazon
                 Lookout for Vision Developer Guide.

              TargetDevice -> (string)
                 The target device for the model. Currently the only supported
                 value is jetson_xavier . If you specify  TargetDevice  ,  you
                 can't specify TargetPlatform .

              TargetPlatform -> (structure)
                 The target platform for the model. If you specify TargetPlat-
                 form , you can't specify TargetDevice .

                 Os -> (string)
                     The target operating system for the model. Linux  is  the
                     only operating system that is currently supported.

                 Arch -> (string)
                     The target architecture for the model. The currently sup-
                     ported architectures are X86_64 (64-bit  version  of  the
                     x86 instruction set) and ARM_64 (ARMv8 64-bit CPU).

                 Accelerator -> (string)
                     The  target  accelerator for the model. Currently, Amazon
                     Lookout for Vision only supports NVIDIA (Nvidia  graphics
                     processing  unit)  and  CPU  accelerators. If you specify
                     NVIDIA as an  accelerator,  you  must  also  specify  the
                     gpu-code  ,  trt-ver  , and cuda-ver compiler options. If
                     you don't specify an accelerator, Lookout for Vision uses
                     the  CPU for compilation and we highly recommend that you
                     use the   GreengrassConfiguration$CompilerOptions  field.
                     For  example,  you can use the following compiler options
                     for CPU:

                     o mcpu : CPU micro-architecture.  For  example,  {'mcpu':
                       'skylake-avx512'}

                     o mattr  :  CPU  flags.  For example, {'mattr': ['+neon',
                       '+vfpv4']}

              S3OutputLocation -> (structure)
                 An S3 location in which Lookout for Vision stores the  compo-
                 nent artifacts.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     The S3 bucket that contains the training or model packag-
                     ing job output. If you are training a model,  the  bucket
                     must  in  your AWS account. If you use an S3 bucket for a
                     model packaging job, the S3 bucket must be  in  the  same
                     AWS  Region  and  AWS  account  in  which you use AWS IoT
                     Greengrass.

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     The path of the folder, within the S3 bucket,  that  con-
                     tains the output.

              ComponentName -> (string)
                 A name for the AWS IoT Greengrass component.

              ComponentVersion -> (string)
                 A  Version for the AWS IoT Greengrass component. If you don't
                 provide a value, a default value of `` Model  Version  .0.0``
                 is used.

              ComponentDescription -> (string)
                 A description for the AWS IoT Greengrass component.

              Tags -> (list)
                 A  set  of  tags (key-value pairs) that you want to attach to
                 the AWS IoT Greengrass component.

                 (structure)
                     A key and value pair that is attached  to  the  specified
                     Amazon Lookout for Vision model.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The  key  of the tag that is attached to the specified
                        model.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag that is attached to the specified
                        model.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Greengrass": {

                }
                ...
              ]
            }
          }

       --description (string)
          A description for the model packaging job.

       --client-token (string)
          ClientToken is an idempotency token that ensures a call to StartMod-
          elPackagingJob completes only once. You choose the  value  to  pass.
          For example, An issue might prevent you from getting a response from
          StartModelPackagingJob . In this case, safely  retry  your  call  to
          StartModelPackagingJob  by  using  the  same  ClientToken  parameter
          value.

          If you don't supply a value for ClientToken , the AWS  SDK  you  are
          using inserts a value for you. This prevents retries after a network
          error from making multiple dataset creation requests. You'll need to
          provide your own value for other use cases.

          An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in
          the first request. Using a different value for ClientToken  is  con-
          sidered  a new call to StartModelPackagingJob . An idempotency token
          is active for 8 hours.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
