OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The  name  of the project that contains the model packaging job that
          you want to describe.

       --job-name (string)
          The job name for the model packaging job.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                     Currently, only NVIDIA Graphics  Processing  Units  (GPU)
                     and  CPU  accelerators are supported. If you specify Tar-
                     getDevice , don't specify CompilerOptions .

                     For more information, see Compiler options in the  Amazon
                     Lookout for Vision Developer Guide.

                 TargetDevice -> (string)
                     The  target device for the model. Currently the only sup-
                     ported value is jetson_xavier . If you specify  TargetDe-
                     vice , you can't specify TargetPlatform .

                 TargetPlatform -> (structure)
                     The target platform for the model. If you specify Target-
                     Platform , you can't specify TargetDevice .

                     Os -> (string)
                        The target operating system for the  model.  Linux  is
                        the only operating system that is currently supported.

                     Arch -> (string)
                        The  target  architecture for the model. The currently
                        supported architectures are X86_64 (64-bit version  of
                        the  x86  instruction  set)  and  ARM_64 (ARMv8 64-bit
                        CPU).

                     Accelerator -> (string)
                        The target accelerator for the model. Currently,  Ama-
                        zon  Lookout  for  Vision only supports NVIDIA (Nvidia
                        graphics processing unit) and CPU accelerators. If you
                        specify  NVIDIA as an accelerator, you must also spec-
                        ify the gpu-code , trt-ver , and cuda-ver compiler op-
                        tions.  If  you  don't specify an accelerator, Lookout
                        for Vision uses the CPU for compilation and we  highly
                        recommend   that  you  use  the   GreengrassConfigura-
                        tion$CompilerOptions field. For example, you  can  use
                        the following compiler options for CPU:

                        o mcpu : CPU micro-architecture. For example, {'mcpu':
                          'skylake-avx512'}

                        o mattr : CPU flags. For example, {'mattr':  ['+neon',
                          '+vfpv4']}

                 S3OutputLocation -> (structure)
                     An  S3  location  in  which Lookout for Vision stores the

                        packaging job output. If you are training a model, the
                        bucket must in your AWS account.  If  you  use  an  S3
                        bucket  for  a model packaging job, the S3 bucket must
                        be in the same AWS Region and AWS account in which you
                        use AWS IoT Greengrass.
