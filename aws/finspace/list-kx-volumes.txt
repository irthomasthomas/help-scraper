OPTIONS
       --environment-id (string)
          A  unique identifier for the kdb environment, whose clusters can at-
          tach to the volume.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in this request.

       --next-token (string)
          A token that indicates where a results page should begin.

       --volume-type (string)
          The type of file system volume. Currently,  FinSpace  only  supports
          NAS_1 volume type.

          Possible values:

          o NAS_1

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

              volumeName -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the volume.

              volumeType -> (string)

              status -> (string)
                 The status of volume.

                 o CREATING  The volume creation is in progress.

                 o CREATE_FAILED  The volume creation has failed.

                 o ACTIVE  The volume is active.

                 o UPDATING  The volume is in the process of being updated.

                 o UPDATE_FAILED  The update action failed.

                 o UPDATED  The volume is successfully updated.

                 o DELETING  The volume is in the process of being deleted.

                 o DELETE_FAILED  The system failed to delete the volume.

                 o DELETED  The volume is successfully deleted.

              description -> (string)
                 A description of the volume.

              statusReason -> (string)
                 The error message when a failed state occurs.

              azMode -> (string)
                 The number of availability zones you want to assign per  vol-
                 ume.  Currently,  FinSpace  only supports SINGLE for volumes.
                 This places dataview in a single AZ.

              availabilityZoneIds -> (list)
                 The identifier of the availability zones.

                 (string)

              createdTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp at which the volume was  created  in  FinSpace.
                 The  value  is  determined as epoch time in milliseconds. For
                 example, the value for Monday, November 1, 2021  12:00:00  PM
                 UTC is specified as 1635768000000.

              lastModifiedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  last  time  that the volume was updated in FinSpace. The
                 value is determined as epoch time in milliseconds. For  exam-
                 ple,  the  value for Monday, November 1, 2021 12:00:00 PM UTC
                 is specified as 1635768000000.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where a results page should begin.
