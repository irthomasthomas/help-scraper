NAME
       update-kx-cluster-databases -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  databases  mounted  on  a kdb cluster, which includes the
       changesetId and all the dbPaths to be cached. This API does  not  allow
       you  to change a database name or add a database if you created a clus-
       ter without one.

       Using this API you can point a cluster to  a  different  changeset  and
       modify a list of partitions being cached.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

              this database.

              databaseName -> (string)
                 The name of the kdb database. When this parameter  is  speci-
                 fied in the structure, S3 with the whole database is included
                 by default.

                        are:

                     dbPaths -> (list)
                        Specifies the portions of database that will be loaded
                        into the cache for access.

                        The name of the dataview to be used for  caching  his-

              changesetId -> (string)
                 A  unique identifier of the changeset that is associated with
                 the cluster.

              dataviewName -> (string)
                 The name of the dataview to be used  for  caching  historical
                 data on disk.

              dataviewConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  configuration  of the dataview to be used with specified
                 cluster.

                 dataviewName -> (string)
                     The unique identifier of the dataview.

                 dataviewVersionId -> (string)
                     The version of the  dataview  corresponding  to  a  given
                     changeset.

                 changesetId -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for the changeset.

                 segmentConfigurations -> (list)
                     The  db  path  and volume configuration for the segmented
                     database.

                     (structure)
                        The configuration that contains the database  path  of
                        the  data that you want to place on each selected vol-
                        ume. Each segment must have a unique database path for
                        each  volume.  If  you  do  not explicitly specify any
                        database path for a volume, they are  accessible  from
                        the  cluster  through the default S3/object store seg-
                        ment.

                            Each segment must have a unique database path  for
                            each volume.

                            (string)

                        volumeName -> (string)
                            The name of the volume where you want to add data.

                        onDemand -> (boolean)
                            Enables on-demand caching on the selected database
                            path when a particular file or  a  column  of  the
                            database  is  accessed.  When on demand caching is
                            True , dataviews perform minimal loading of  files
                            on  the  filesystem  as  needed. When it is set to
                            False , everything is cached. The default value is
                            False .

       --deployment-configuration (structure)
          The  configuration  that allows you to choose how you want to update
          the databases on a cluster.

          deploymentStrategy -> (string)
              The type of deployment that you want on a cluster.

              o ROLLING  This options updates the cluster by stopping the  ex-
                iting q process and starting a new q process with updated con-
                figuration.

              o NO_RESTART  This option updates the cluster  without  stopping
                the running q process. It is only available for HDB type clus-
                ter. This option is quicker as it reduces the turn around time
                to  update  configuration  on a cluster.  With this deployment
                mode, you cannot update the initializationScript and  command-
                LineArguments parameters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

       JSON Syntax:

          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
