OPTIONS
       --environment-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the kdb environment, for which you want to
          retrieve a list of dataviews.

       --database-name (string)
          The name of the database where the dataviews were created.

       --next-token (string)
          A token that indicates where a results page should begin.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in this request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT

          The list of kdb dataviews that are currently active  for  the  given
          database.

          (structure)
              A collection of kdb dataview entries.

              environmentId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the kdb environment.

              databaseName -> (string)
                 A unique identifier of the database.

              dataviewName -> (string)
                 A unique identifier of the dataview.

              azMode -> (string)
                 The  number of availability zones you want to assign per vol-
                 ume. Currently, FinSpace only supports  SINGLE  for  volumes.
                 This places dataview in a single AZ.

              availabilityZoneId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the availability zones.

              changesetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the changeset.

              segmentConfigurations -> (list)
                 The configuration that contains the database path of the data
                 that you want to place on each selected volume. Each  segment
                 must  have  a unique database path for each volume. If you do
                 not explicitly specify any database path for a  volume,  they
                 are accessible from the cluster through the default S3/object
                 store segment.

                 (structure)
                     The configuration that contains the database path of  the
                     data that you want to place on each selected volume. Each
                     segment must have a unique database path for each volume.
                     If  you do not explicitly specify any database path for a
                     volume, they are accessible from the cluster through  the
                     default S3/object store segment.

                     dbPaths -> (list)
                        The  database  path of the data that you want to place
                        on each selected volume for the segment. Each  segment

                        base  is  accessed.  When  on demand caching is True ,
                        dataviews perform minimal  loading  of  files  on  the
                        filesystem as needed. When it is set to False , every-
                        thing is cached. The default value is False .

                        each volume. If you  do  not  explicitly  specify  any
                        database  path  for a volume, they are accessible from
                        the cluster through the default S3/object  store  seg-
                        ment.

                            database path for each volume. If you do  not  ex-
                            plicitly  specify  any database path for a volume,
                            they are accessible from the cluster  through  the
                            default S3/object store segment.

                               Each  segment  must have a unique database path
                               for each volume.

                               the   database  is  accessed.  When  on  demand
                               caching is True  ,  dataviews  perform  minimal
