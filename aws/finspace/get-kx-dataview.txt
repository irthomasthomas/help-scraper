OPTIONS
       --environment-id (string)
          A  unique identifier for the kdb environment, from where you want to
          retrieve the dataview details.

       --database-name (string)
          The name of the database where you created the dataview.

       --dataview-name (string)
          A unique identifier for the dataview.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       databaseName -> (string)
          The name of the database where you created the dataview.

       dataviewName -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the dataview.

       azMode -> (string)
          The number of availability zones you want to assign per volume. Cur-
          rently,  FinSpace  only  supports  SINGLE  for  volumes. This places
          dataview in a single AZ.

       availabilityZoneId -> (string)
          The identifier of the availability zones.

       changesetId -> (string)
          A unique identifier of the changeset that you want to use to  ingest
          data.

       segmentConfigurations -> (list)
          The  configuration  that contains the database path of the data that
          you want to place on each selected volume. Each segment must have  a
          unique database path for each volume. If you do not explicitly spec-
          ify any database path for a volume, they  are  accessible  from  the
          cluster through the default S3/object store segment.

          (structure)
              The  configuration  that  contains the database path of the data
              that you want to place on each  selected  volume.  Each  segment
              must  have a unique database path for each volume. If you do not
              explicitly specify any database path for a volume, they are  ac-
              cessible  from  the  cluster through the default S3/object store
              segment.

              dbPaths -> (list)
                 The database path of the data that you want to place on  each
                 selected  volume  for  the  segment. Each segment must have a
                 unique database path for each volume.

                 (string)

              volumeName -> (string)
                 The name of the volume where you want to add data.

              onDemand -> (boolean)
                 Enables on-demand caching on the selected database path  when
                 a  particular  file  or a column of the database is accessed.
                 When on demand caching is True ,  dataviews  perform  minimal
                 loading  of files on the filesystem as needed. When it is set
                 to False , everything is cached. The default value is False .

       activeVersions -> (list)
          The current active changeset versions of the database on  the  given
          dataview.

          (structure)
              The  active  version of the dataview that is currently in use by
              this cluster.

              changesetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the changeset.

              segmentConfigurations -> (list)
                 The configuration that contains the database path of the data
                 that  you want to place on each selected volume. Each segment
                 must have a unique database path for each volume. If  you  do
                 not  explicitly  specify any database path for a volume, they
                 are accessible from the cluster through the default S3/object
                 store segment.

                 (structure)
                     The  configuration that contains the database path of the
                     data that you want to place on each selected volume. Each
                     segment must have a unique database path for each volume.
                     If you do not explicitly specify any database path for  a
                     volume,  they are accessible from the cluster through the
                     default S3/object store segment.

                     dbPaths -> (list)
                        The database path of the data that you want  to  place
                        on  each selected volume for the segment. Each segment
                        must have a unique database path for each volume.

                        The name of the volume where you want to add data.

                     onDemand -> (boolean)
                        Enables on-demand caching  on  the  selected  database
                        path  when  a particular file or a column of the data-
                        base is accessed. When on demand  caching  is  True  ,
                        dataviews  perform  minimal  loading  of  files on the
                        filesystem as needed. When it is set to False , every-
                        thing is cached. The default value is False .

                 The  timestamp  at which the dataview version was active. The
                 value is determined as epoch time in milliseconds. For  exam-
                 ple,  the  value for Monday, November 1, 2021 12:00:00 PM UTC
                 is specified as 1635768000000.

          tions and corrections automatically to the dataview when new change-
          sets are ingested. The default value is false.

       readWrite -> (boolean)
