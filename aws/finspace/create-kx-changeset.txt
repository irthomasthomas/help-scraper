OPTIONS
       --environment-id (string)
          A unique identifier of the kdb environment.

       --database-name (string)
          The name of the kdb database.

       --change-requests (list)
          A list of change request objects that are run in order. A change re-
          quest  object  consists  of  changeType  ,  s3Path,  and a dbPath. A
          changeType can has the following values:

          o PUT  Adds or updates files in a database.

          o DELETE  Deletes files in a database.

          All the change requests require a mandatory  dbPath  attribute  that
          defines the path within the database directory. The s3Path attribute
          defines the s3 source file path and is required  for  a  PUT  change
          type.

          Here is an example of how you can use the change request object:
              [  { "changeType": "PUT", "s3Path":"s3://bucket/db/2020.01.02/",
              "dbPath":"/2020.01.02/"},      {      "changeType":       "PUT",
              "s3Path":"s3://bucket/db/sym",  "dbPath":"/"},  {  "changeType":
              "DELETE", "dbPath": "/2020.01.01/"} ]

          In this example, the first request with PUT change type  allows  you
          to  add  files in the given s3Path under the 2020.01.02 partition of
          the database. The second request with PUT change type allows you  to
          add  a  single  sym file at database root location. The last request
          with DELETE change type allows you to delete  the  files  under  the
          2020.01.01 partition of the database.

          (structure)
              A list of change request objects.

              changeType -> (string)
                 Defines the type of change request. A changeType can have the
                 following values:

                 o PUT  Adds or updates files in a database.

                 o DELETE  Deletes files in a database.

              s3Path -> (string)
                 Defines the S3 path of the source file that  is  required  to
                 add or update files in a database.

              dbPath -> (string)
                 Defines the path within the database directory.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          changeType=string,s3Path=string,dbPath=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "changeType": "PUT"|"DELETE",
              "s3Path": "string",
              "dbPath": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-token (string)
          A token that ensures idempotency. This token expires in 10 minutes.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
