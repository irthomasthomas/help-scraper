CREATE-KX-DATAVIEW()                                      CREATE-KX-DATAVIEW()



NAME
       create-kx-dataview -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a snapshot of kdb database with tiered storage capabilities and
       a pre-warmed cache, ready for mounting on kdb clusters.  Dataviews  are
       only  available  for  clusters running on a scaling group. They are not
       supported on dedicated clusters.

OPTIONS
       --environment-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the kdb environment, where you want to  cre-
          ate the dataview.

       --database-name (string)
          The name of the database where you want to create a dataview.

       --dataview-name (string)
          A unique identifier for the dataview.

       --az-mode (string)
          The number of availability zones you want to assign per volume. Cur-
          rently, FinSpace only  supports  SINGLE  for  volumes.  This  places
          dataview in a single AZ.

          Possible values:

          o SINGLE

          o MULTI

       --availability-zone-id (string)
          The identifier of the availability zones.

       --changeset-id (string)
          A  unique identifier of the changeset that you want to use to ingest
          data.

       --segment-configurations (list)
          The configuration that contains the database path of the  data  that
          you  want to place on each selected volume. Each segment must have a
          unique database path for each volume. If you do not explicitly spec-
          ify  any  database  path  for a volume, they are accessible from the
          cluster through the default S3/object store segment.

          (structure)
              The configuration that contains the database path  of  the  data
              that  you  want  to  place on each selected volume. Each segment
              must have a unique database path for each volume. If you do  not
              explicitly  specify any database path for a volume, they are ac-
              cessible from the cluster through the  default  S3/object  store
              segment.

              dbPaths -> (list)
                 The  database path of the data that you want to place on each
                 selected volume for the segment. Each  segment  must  have  a
                 unique database path for each volume.

                 (string)

              volumeName -> (string)
                 The name of the volume where you want to add data.

              onDemand -> (boolean)
                 Enables  on-demand caching on the selected database path when
                 a particular file or a column of the  database  is  accessed.
                 When  on  demand  caching is True , dataviews perform minimal
                 loading of files on the filesystem as needed. When it is  set
                 to False , everything is cached. The default value is False .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          dbPaths=string,string,volumeName=string,onDemand=boolean ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "dbPaths": ["string", ...],
              "volumeName": "string",
              "onDemand": true|false
            }
            ...
          ]

       --auto-update | --no-auto-update (boolean)
          The option to specify whether you want to apply all the future addi-
          tions and corrections automatically to the dataview, when you ingest
          new changesets. The default value is false.

       --read-write | --no-read-write (boolean)
          The option to specify whether you want to make the dataview writable
          to perform database maintenance. The following are  some  considera-
          tions related to writable dataviews.

          o You  cannot  create  partial  writable  dataviews. When you create
            writeable dataviews you must provide the entire database path.

          o You cannot perform updates on a writeable dataview. Hence, autoUp-
            date must be set as False if readWrite is True for a dataview.

          o You  must  also  use  a  unique  volume  for  creating a writeable
            dataview. So, if you choose a volume that is already in use by an-
            other dataview, the dataview creation fails.

          o Once  you  create a dataview as writeable, you cannot change it to
            read-only. So, you cannot update the readWrite parameter later.

       --description (string)
          A description of the dataview.

       --tags (map)
          A list of key-value pairs to label the dataview. You can add  up  to
          50 tags to a dataview.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --client-token (string)
          A token that ensures idempotency. This token expires in 10 minutes.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
