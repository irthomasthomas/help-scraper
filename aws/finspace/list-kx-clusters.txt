OPTIONS
       --environment-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the kdb environment.

       --cluster-type (string)
          Specifies  the  type of KDB database that is being created. The fol-
          lowing types are available:

          o HDB  A Historical Database.  The  data  is  only  accessible  with
            read-only  permissions  from one of the FinSpace managed kdb data-
            bases mounted to the cluster.

          o RDB  A Realtime Database. This type of database captures  all  the
            data  from a ticker plant and stores it in memory until the end of
            day, after which it writes all of its data to a disk  and  reloads
            the  HDB.  This  cluster type requires local storage for temporary
            storage of data during the savedown process. If you  specify  this
            field in your request, you must provide the savedownStorageConfig-
            uration parameter.

          o GATEWAY  A gateway cluster allows you to access data  across  pro-
            cesses  in  kdb  systems. It allows you to create your own routing
            logic using the initialization scripts and custom code. This  type
            of cluster does not require a writable local storage.

          o GP   A  general  purpose  cluster allows you to quickly iterate on
            code during development by granting greater access to system  com-
            mands and enabling a fast reload of custom code. This cluster type
            can optionally mount databases including cache and savedown  stor-
            age.  For this cluster type, the node count is fixed at 1. It does
            not support autoscaling and supports only SINGLE AZ mode.

          Possible values:

          o HDB

          o RDB

          o GATEWAY

          o GP

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in this request.

       --next-token (string)
          A token that indicates where a results page should begin.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

              clusterName -> (string)
                 A unique name for the cluster.

              clusterType -> (string)
                 Specifies the type of KDB database that is being created. The
                 following types are available:

                 o HDB  A Historical Database. The  data  is  only  accessible
                   with read-only permissions from one of the FinSpace managed
                   kdb databases mounted to the cluster.

                 o RDB  A Realtime Database. This type  of  database  captures
                   all  the  data  from a ticker plant and stores it in memory
                   until the end of day, after which it writes all of its data
                   to  a  disk and reloads the HDB. This cluster type requires
                   local storage for temporary  storage  of  data  during  the
                   savedown  process.  If  you  specify this field in your re-
                   quest, you must  provide  the  savedownStorageConfiguration
                   parameter.

                 o GATEWAY  A gateway cluster allows you to access data across
                   processes in kdb systems. It allows you to create your  own
                   routing  logic  using the initialization scripts and custom
                   code. This type of cluster does not require a writable  lo-
                   cal storage.

                 o GP  A general purpose cluster allows you to quickly iterate
                   on code during development by granting  greater  access  to
                   system  commands and enabling a fast reload of custom code.
                   This cluster type can optionally mount databases  including
                   cache and savedown storage. For this cluster type, the node
                   count is fixed at 1. It does not  support  autoscaling  and
                   supports only SINGLE AZ mode.

              clusterDescription -> (string)
                 A description of the cluster.

              releaseLabel -> (string)
                 A version of the FinSpace managed kdb to run.

              initializationScript -> (string)
                 Specifies  a  Q program that will be run at launch of a clus-
                 ter. It is a relative path within .zip file that contains the
                 custom code, which will be loaded on the cluster. It must in-
                 clude the file name itself. For example, somedir/init.q .

              executionRole -> (string)
                 An IAM role that defines a set of permissions associated with
                 a  cluster.  These permissions are assumed when a cluster at-
                 tempts to access another cluster.

              azMode -> (string)
                 The number of availability zones assigned per  cluster.  This
                 can be one of the following:

                 o SINGLE  Assigns one availability zone per cluster.

                 o MULTI  Assigns all the availability zones per cluster.

              availabilityZoneId -> (string)
                 The availability zone identifiers for the requested regions.

              lastModifiedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The last time that the cluster was modified. The value is de-
                 termined as epoch time  in  milliseconds.  For  example,  the
                 value  for Monday, November 1, 2021 12:00:00 PM UTC is speci-
                 fied as 1635768000000.

              createdTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp at which the cluster was created  in  FinSpace.
                 The  value  is  determined as epoch time in milliseconds. For
                 example, the value for Monday, November 1, 2021  12:00:00  PM
                 UTC is specified as 1635768000000.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where a results page should begin.
