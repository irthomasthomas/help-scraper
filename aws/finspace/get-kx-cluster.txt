OPTIONS
       --environment-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the kdb environment.

       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the cluster that you want to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

          The status of cluster creation.

          o PENDING  The cluster is pending creation.

          o CREATING  The cluster creation process is in progress.

          o DELETE_FAILED  The cluster failed to delete.

       statusReason -> (string)
          The error message when a failed state occurs.

       clusterName -> (string)
          A unique name for the cluster.

       clusterType -> (string)
          Specifies the type of KDB database that is being created.  The  fol-
          lowing types are available:

          o HDB   A  Historical  Database.  The  data  is only accessible with
            read-only permissions from one of the FinSpace managed  kdb  data-
            bases mounted to the cluster.

          o RDB   A  Realtime Database. This type of database captures all the
            data from a ticker plant and stores it in memory until the end  of
            day,  after  which it writes all of its data to a disk and reloads
            the HDB. This cluster type requires local  storage  for  temporary
            storage  of  data during the savedown process. If you specify this
            field in your request, you must provide the savedownStorageConfig-
            uration parameter.

          o GATEWAY   A  gateway cluster allows you to access data across pro-
            cesses in kdb systems. It allows you to create  your  own  routing
            logic  using the initialization scripts and custom code. This type
            of cluster does not require a writable local storage.

       databases -> (list)

                 The  name  of the kdb database. When this parameter is speci-
                 fied in the structure, S3 with the whole database is included
                 by default.

              cacheConfigurations -> (list)
                 Configuration  details  for  the  disk cache used to increase
                 performance reading from a kdb database mounted to the  clus-
                 ter.

                     The  structure  of  database  cache configuration that is
                     used for mapping database paths to cache types  in  clus-
                     ters.

                     cacheType -> (string)
                        The  type of disk cache. This parameter is used to map
                        the database path to cache storage. The  valid  values
                        are:

                        o CACHE_1000   This  type  provides at least 1000 MB/s
                          disk access throughput.

                     dbPaths -> (list)
                        Specifies the portions of database that will be loaded
                        into the cache for access.

                        (string)

              changesetId -> (string)
                 A  unique identifier of the changeset that is associated with
                 the cluster.

       cacheStorageConfigurations -> (list)
          The configurations for a read only cache storage associated  with  a
          cluster.  This cache will be stored as an FSx Lustre that reads from
          the S3 store.

          (structure)
              The configuration for read only disk  cache  associated  with  a
              cluster.

                 The type of cache storage. The valid values are:

                 o CACHE_1000   This type provides at least 1000 MB/s disk ac-
                   cess throughput.

                 o CACHE_250  This type provides at least 250 MB/s disk access
                   throughput.

                 o CACHE_12   This  type provides at least 12 MB/s disk access
                   throughput.

                 For cache type CACHE_1000 and CACHE_250 you can select  cache
                 size  as  1200  GB  or  increments of 2400 GB. For cache type
                 CACHE_12 you can select the cache size in increments of  6000
                 GB.

              1 and less than the maxNodeCount . If the nodes in a cluster be-
              long to multiple availability zones, then minNodeCount  must  be
              at least 3.

          maxNodeCount -> (integer)
              The  highest  number  of  nodes  to  scale. This value cannot be
              greater than 5.

          autoScalingMetric -> (string)
              The metric your cluster will track in order to scale in and out.
              For example, CPU_UTILIZATION_PERCENTAGE is the average CPU usage
              across all the nodes in a cluster.

          metricTarget -> (double)
              The desired value of the chosen  autoScalingMetric  .  When  the
              metric  drops  below this value, the cluster will scale in. When
              the metric goes above this value, the cluster  will  scale  out.
              You can set the target value between 1 and 100 percent.

          scaleInCooldownSeconds -> (double)
              The duration in seconds that FinSpace will wait after a scale in
              event before initiating another scaling event.
