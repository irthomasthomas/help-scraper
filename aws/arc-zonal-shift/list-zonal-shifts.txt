LIST-ZONAL-SHIFTS()                                        LIST-ZONAL-SHIFTS()



NAME
       list-zonal-shifts -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all the active zonal shifts in Amazon Route 53 Application Recov-
       ery Controller in your AWS account in this AWS Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-zonal-shifts is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: items

OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          A status for a zonal shift.

          The Status for a zonal shift can have one of the following values:

          o ACTIVE : The zonal shift is started and active.

          o EXPIRED  :  The  zonal  shift has expired (the expiry time was ex-
            ceeded).

          o CANCELED : The zonal shift was canceled.

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o EXPIRED

          o CANCELED

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       items -> (list)
          The items in the response list.

          (structure)
              You start a zonal shift to temporarily move load balancer  traf-
              fic  away  from  an  Availability  Zone in a AWS Region. A zonal
              shift helps your application recover immediately,  for  example,
              from  a  developer's  bad  code deployment or from an AWS infra-
              structure failure in a single Availability Zone. You can start a
              zonal  shift  in Route 53 ARC only for managed resources in your
              account in an AWS Region. Supported AWS resources are  automati-
              cally registered with Route 53 ARC.

              Zonal  shifts  are temporary. A zonal shift can be active for up
              to three days (72 hours).

              When you start a zonal shift, you specify how long you  want  it
              to  be  active,  which Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Con-
              troller converts to an expiry time (expiration  time).  You  can
              cancel  a  zonal  shift, for example, if you're ready to restore
              traffic to the Availability Zone. Or you can  extend  the  zonal
              shift  by  updating  the expiration so the zonal shift is active
              longer.

              awayFrom -> (string)
                 The Availability Zone that traffic is moved away from  for  a
                 resource  when you start a zonal shift. Until the zonal shift
                 expires or you cancel it, traffic for the resource is instead
                 moved to other Availability Zones in the AWS Region.

              comment -> (string)
                 A comment that you enter about the zonal shift. Only the lat-
                 est comment is retained; no comment  history  is  maintained.
                 That  is,  a  new  comment  overwrites  any  existing comment
                 string.

              expiryTime -> (timestamp)
                 The expiry time (expiration time)  for  the  zonal  shift.  A
                 zonal  shift  is temporary and must be set to expire when you
                 start the zonal shift. You can initially set a zonal shift to
                 expire  in  a  maximum of three days (72 hours). However, you
                 can update a zonal shift to set a new expiration at any time.

                 When you start a zonal shift, you specify how long  you  want
                 it  to  be  active,  which Route 53 ARC converts to an expiry
                 time (expiration time). You can cancel a zonal shift, for ex-
                 ample, if you're ready to restore traffic to the Availability
                 Zone. Or you can update the zonal shift  to  specify  another
                 length of time to expire in.

              resourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 The  identifier for the resource to include in a zonal shift.
                 The identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the  re-
                 source.

                 At  this  time,  you can only start a zonal shift for Network
                 Load Balancers and Application Load Balancers with cross-zone
                 load balancing turned off.

              startTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time (UTC) when the zonal shift is started.

              status -> (string)
                 A status for a zonal shift.

                 The  Status  for  a zonal shift can have one of the following
                 values:

                 o ACTIVE: The zonal shift is started and active.

                 o EXPIRED: The zonal shift has expired (the expiry  time  was
                   exceeded).

                 o CANCELED: The zonal shift was canceled.

              zonalShiftId -> (string)
                 The identifier of a zonal shift.

       nextToken -> (string)
          Specifies  that  you want to receive the next page of results. Valid
          only if you received a NextToken response in the  previous  request.
          If you did, it indicates that more output is available. Set this pa-
          rameter to the value provided by the previous call's  NextToken  re-
          sponse to request the next page of results.
