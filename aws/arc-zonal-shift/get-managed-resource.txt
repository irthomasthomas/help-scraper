GET-MANAGED-RESOURCE()                                  GET-MANAGED-RESOURCE()



NAME
       get-managed-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Get  information  about  a  resource  that's  been registered for zonal
       shifts with Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller in this AWS
       Region.  Resources that are registered for zonal shifts are managed re-
       sources in Route 53 ARC.

       At this time, you can only start a zonal shift for  Network  Load  Bal-
       ancers  and  Application  Load Balancers with cross-zone load balancing
       turned off.

OPTIONS
       --resource-identifier (string)
          The identifier for the resource to include in  a  zonal  shift.  The
          identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource.

          At this time, you can only start a zonal shift for Network Load Bal-
          ancers and Application Load Balancers with cross-zone load balancing
          turned off.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       appliedWeights -> (map)
          A collection of key-value pairs that indicate whether resources  are
          active  in Availability Zones or not. The key name is the Availabil-
          ity Zone where the resource is deployed. The value is 1 or 0.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (float)

       arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource.

       name -> (string)
          The name of the resource.

       zonalShifts -> (list)
          The zonal shifts that are currently active for a resource.

          (structure)
              A complex structure that lists the zonal shifts  for  a  managed
              resource and their statuses for the resource.

              appliedStatus -> (string)
                 An  appliedStatus  for  a zonal shift for a resource can have
                 one of two values: APPLIED or NOT_APPLIED .

              awayFrom -> (string)
                 The Availability Zone that traffic is moved away from  for  a
                 resource  when you start a zonal shift. Until the zonal shift
                 expires or you cancel it, traffic for the resource is instead
                 moved to other Availability Zones in the AWS Region.

              comment -> (string)
                 A comment that you enter about the zonal shift. Only the lat-
                 est comment is retained; no comment  history  is  maintained.
                 That  is,  a  new  comment  overwrites  any  existing comment
                 string.

              expiryTime -> (timestamp)
                 The expiry time (expiration time)  for  the  zonal  shift.  A
                 zonal  shift  is temporary and must be set to expire when you
                 start the zonal shift. You can initially set a zonal shift to
                 expire  in  a  maximum of three days (72 hours). However, you
                 can update a zonal shift to set a new expiration at any time.

                 When you start a zonal shift, you specify how long  you  want
                 it  to  be  active,  which Route 53 ARC converts to an expiry
                 time (expiration time). You can cancel a zonal shift, for ex-
                 ample, if you're ready to restore traffic to the Availability
                 Zone. Or you can update the zonal shift  to  specify  another
                 length of time to expire in.

              resourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 The  identifier for the resource to include in a zonal shift.
                 The identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the  re-
                 source.

                 At  this  time,  you can only start a zonal shift for Network
                 Load Balancers and Application Load Balancers with cross-zone
                 load balancing turned off.

              startTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time (UTC) when the zonal shift is started.

              zonalShiftId -> (string)
                 The identifier of a zonal shift.
