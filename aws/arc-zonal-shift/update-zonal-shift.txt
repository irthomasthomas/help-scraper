OPTIONS
       --comment (string)
          A comment that you enter about the zonal shift. Only the latest com-
          ment  is  retained;  no comment history is maintained. A new comment
          overwrites any existing comment string.

       --expires-in (string)
          The length of time that you want a zonal shift to be  active,  which
          Route  53  ARC  converts  to an expiry time (expiration time). Zonal
          shifts are temporary. You can set a zonal shift to  be  active  ini-
          tially for up to three days (72 hours).

          If  you  want  to still keep traffic away from an Availability Zone,
          you can update the zonal shift and set a  new  expiration.  You  can
          also cancel a zonal shift, before it expires, for example, if you're
          ready to restore traffic to the Availability Zone.

          To set a length of time for a zonal shift to be  active,  specify  a
          whole number, and then one of the following, with no space:

          o A lowercase letter m: To specify that the value is in minutes.

          o A lowercase letter h: To specify that the value is in hours.

          For  example:  20h  means  the zonal shift expires in 20 hours. 120m
          means the zonal shift expires in 120 minutes (2 hours).

       --zonal-shift-id (string)
          The identifier of a zonal shift.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       awayFrom -> (string)
          The Availability Zone that traffic is moved away from for a resource
          when you start a zonal shift. Until the zonal shift expires  or  you
          cancel it, traffic for the resource is instead moved to other Avail-
          ability Zones in the Amazon Web Services Region.

       comment -> (string)
          A comment that you enter about the zonal shift. Only the latest com-
          ment  is  retained;  no comment history is maintained. A new comment
          overwrites any existing comment string.

       expiryTime -> (timestamp)
          The expiry time  (expiration  time)  for  a  customer-started  zonal
          shift. A zonal shift is temporary and must be set to expire when you
          start the zonal shift. You can initially set a zonal shift to expire
          in  a  maximum  of  three days (72 hours). However, you can update a
          zonal shift to set a new expiration at any time.

          When you start a zonal shift, you specify how long you want it to be
          active,  which  Route  53 ARC converts to an expiry time (expiration
          time). You can cancel a zonal shift when  you're  ready  to  restore
          traffic  to the Availability Zone, or just wait for it to expire. Or
          you can update the zonal shift to specify another length of time  to
          expire in.

       resourceIdentifier -> (string)
          The identifier for the resource to shift away traffic for. The iden-
          tifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource.

          At this time, supported resources are Network Load Balancers and Ap-
          plication Load Balancers with cross-zone load balancing turned off.

       startTime -> (timestamp)
          The time (UTC) when the zonal shift starts.

       status -> (string)
          A status for a zonal shift.

          The Status for a zonal shift can have one of the following values:

          o ACTIVE: The zonal shift has been started and active.

          o EXPIRED:  The  zonal  shift  has  expired (the expiry time was ex-
            ceeded).

          o CANCELED: The zonal shift was canceled.

       zonalShiftId -> (string)
          The identifier of a zonal shift.
