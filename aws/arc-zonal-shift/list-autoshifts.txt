LIST-AUTOSHIFTS()                                            LIST-AUTOSHIFTS()



NAME
       list-autoshifts -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of autoshifts for an Amazon Web Services Region. By de-
       fault, the call returns only ACTIVE  autoshifts.  Optionally,  you  can
       specify the status parameter to return COMPLETED autoshifts.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-autoshifts is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: items

OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          The status of the autoshift.

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o COMPLETED

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       items -> (list)
          The items in the response list.

          (structure)
              Information  about  an  autoshift. Amazon Web Services starts an
              autoshift to temporarily move traffic for a resource  away  from
              an  Availability Zone in an Amazon Web Services Region when Ama-
              zon Web Services determines that there's an issue in the  Avail-
              ability  Zone  that  could potentially affect customers. You can
              configure zonal autoshift in Route 53 ARC for managed  resources
              in  your Amazon Web Services account in a Region. Supported Ama-
              zon Web Services resources  are  automatically  registered  with
              Route 53 ARC.

              Autoshifts  are  temporary. When the Availability Zone recovers,
              Amazon Web Services ends the autoshift, and traffic for the  re-
              source  is no longer directed to the other Availability Zones in
              the Region.

              You can stop an autoshift for a resource by disabling zonal  au-
              toshift.

              awayFrom -> (string)
                 The  Availability  Zone (for example, use1-az1 ) that traffic
                 is shifted away from for a resource when Amazon Web  Services
                 starts  an  autoshift.  Until the autoshift ends, traffic for
                 the resource is instead directed to other Availability  Zones
                 in the Amazon Web Services Region. An autoshift can end for a
                 resource, for example, when Amazon Web Services ends the  au-
                 toshift  for  the Availability Zone or when you disable zonal
                 autoshift for the resource.

              endTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time (in UTC) when the autoshift ended.

              startTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time (in UTC) when the autoshift started.

              status -> (string)
                 The status for an autoshift.

       nextToken -> (string)
          Specifies that you want to receive the next page of  results.  Valid
          only  if  you received a NextToken response in the previous request.
          If you did, it indicates that more output is available. Set this pa-
          rameter  to  the value provided by the previous call's NextToken re-
          sponse to request the next page of results.
