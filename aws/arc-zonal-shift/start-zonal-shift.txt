START-ZONAL-SHIFT()                                        START-ZONAL-SHIFT()



NAME
       start-zonal-shift -

DESCRIPTION
       You  start a zonal shift to temporarily move load balancer traffic away
       from an Availability Zone in a AWS Region, to help your application re-
       cover  immediately, for example, from a developer's bad code deployment
       or from an AWS infrastructure failure in a  single  Availability  Zone.
       You  can start a zonal shift in Route 53 ARC only for managed resources
       in your account in an AWS Region. Resources  are  automatically  regis-
       tered with Route 53 ARC by AWS services.

       At  this  time,  you can only start a zonal shift for Network Load Bal-
       ancers and Application Load Balancers with  cross-zone  load  balancing
       turned off.

       When  you  start  a  zonal shift, traffic for the resource is no longer
       routed to the Availability Zone. The zonal shift is created immediately
       in  Route  53 ARC. However, it can take a short time, typically up to a
       few minutes, for existing, in-progress connections in the  Availability
       Zone to complete.

       For  more  information, see Zonal shift in the Amazon Route 53 Applica-
       tion Recovery Controller Developer Guide.

OPTIONS
       --away-from (string)
          The Availability Zone that traffic is moved away from for a resource
          when  you  start a zonal shift. Until the zonal shift expires or you
          cancel it, traffic for the resource is instead moved to other Avail-
          ability Zones in the AWS Region.

       --comment (string)
          A comment that you enter about the zonal shift. Only the latest com-
          ment is retained; no comment history is maintained.  A  new  comment
          overwrites any existing comment string.

       --expires-in (string)
          The  length  of time that you want a zonal shift to be active, which
          Route 53 ARC converts to an expiry  time  (expiration  time).  Zonal
          shifts  are  temporary.  You can set a zonal shift to be active ini-
          tially for up to three days (72 hours).

          If you want to still keep traffic away from  an  Availability  Zone,
          you  can  update  the  zonal shift and set a new expiration. You can
          also cancel a zonal shift, before it expires, for example, if you're
          ready to restore traffic to the Availability Zone.

          To  set  a  length of time for a zonal shift to be active, specify a
          whole number, and then one of the following, with no space:
              <ul> <li> <p> <b>A lowercase letter m:</b> To specify  that  the
              value  is  in  minutes.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>A lowercase letter
              h:</b> To specify that the value is in  hours.</p>  </li>  </ul>
              <p>For  example:  <code>20h</code> means the zonal shift expires
              in 20 hours. <code>120m</code> means the zonal shift expires  in
              120 minutes (2 hours).</p>

       --resource-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  for  the  resource to include in a zonal shift. The
          identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource.

          At this time, you can only start a zonal shift for Network Load Bal-
          ancers and Application Load Balancers with cross-zone load balancing
          turned off.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       awayFrom -> (string)
          The Availability Zone that traffic is moved away from for a resource
          when you start a zonal shift. Until the zonal shift expires  or  you
          cancel it, traffic for the resource is instead moved to other Avail-
          ability Zones in the AWS Region.

       comment -> (string)
          A comment that you enter about the zonal shift. Only the latest com-
          ment  is  retained;  no comment history is maintained. A new comment
          overwrites any existing comment string.

       expiryTime -> (timestamp)
          The expiry time (expiration time) for the zonal shift. A zonal shift
          is  temporary  and  must  be  set to expire when you start the zonal
          shift. You can initially set a zonal shift to expire in a maximum of
          three  days (72 hours). However, you can update a zonal shift to set
          a new expiration at any time.

          When you start a zonal shift, you specify how long you want it to be
          active,  which  Route  53 ARC converts to an expiry time (expiration
          time). You can cancel a zonal shift, for example, if you're ready to
          restore  traffic  to  the  Availability  Zone. Or you can update the
          zonal shift to specify another length of time to expire in.

       resourceIdentifier -> (string)
          The identifier for the resource to include in  a  zonal  shift.  The
          identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource.

          At this time, you can only start a zonal shift for Network Load Bal-
          ancers and Application Load Balancers with cross-zone load balancing
          turned off.

       startTime -> (timestamp)
          The time (UTC) when the zonal shift is started.

       status -> (string)
          A status for a zonal shift.

          The Status for a zonal shift can have one of the following values:

          o ACTIVE: The zonal shift is started and active.

          o EXPIRED:  The  zonal  shift  has  expired (the expiry time was ex-
            ceeded).

          o CANCELED: The zonal shift was canceled.

       zonalShiftId -> (string)
          The identifier of a zonal shift.
