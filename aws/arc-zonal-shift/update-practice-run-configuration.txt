OPTIONS
       --blocked-dates (list)
          Add, change, or remove blocked dates for a practice run in zonal au-
          toshift.

          Optionally, you can block practice runs for specific calendar dates.
          The  format for blocked dates is: YYYY-MM-DD. Keep in mind, when you
          specify dates, that dates and times for practice runs  are  in  UTC.
          Separate multiple blocked dates with spaces.

          For  example,  if you have an application update scheduled to launch
          on May 1, 2024, and you don't want practice runs  to  shift  traffic
          away at that time, you could set a blocked date for 2024-05-01 .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --blocked-windows (list)
          Add,  change,  or remove windows of days and times for when you can,
          optionally, block Route 53 ARC from starting a practice  run  for  a
          resource.

          The  format  for  blocked  windows  is: DAY:HH:SS-DAY:HH:SS. Keep in
          mind, when you specify dates, that dates and times for practice runs
          are  in UTC. Also, be aware of potential time adjustments that might
          be required for daylight saving time differences. Separate  multiple
          blocked windows with spaces.

          For  example,  say  you  run  business report summaries three days a
          week. For this scenario, you might set the following recurring  days
          and   times   as   blocked  windows,  for  example:  MON-20:30-21:30
          WED-20:30-21:30 FRI-20:30-21:30 .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --blocking-alarms (list)
          Add, change, or remove the Amazon CloudWatch alarm that you  option-
          ally specify as the blocking alarm for practice runs.

          (structure)
              A  control condition is an alarm that you specify for a practice
              run. When you configure practice runs with zonal autoshift for a
              resource, you specify Amazon CloudWatch alarms, which you create
              in CloudWatch to use with the practice run. The alarms that  you
              specify  are  an  outcome  alarm , to monitor application health
              during practice runs and, optionally,  a  blocking  alarm  ,  to
              block practice runs from starting or to interrupt a practice run
              in progress.

              Control condition alarms do not apply for autoshifts.

              For more information,  see  Considerations  when  you  configure
              zonal autoshift in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Con-
              troller Developer Guide.

              alarmIdentifier -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an Amazon CloudWatch alarm
                 that you specify as a control condition for a practice run.

              type -> (string)
                 The  type of alarm specified for a practice run. You can only
                 specify Amazon CloudWatch alarms for practice  runs,  so  the
                 only valid value is CLOUDWATCH .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          alarmIdentifier=string,type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "alarmIdentifier": "string",

            }
            ...
          ]

       --outcome-alarms (list)
          Specify  a  new the Amazon CloudWatch alarm as the outcome alarm for
          practice runs.

          (structure)
              A control condition is an alarm that you specify for a  practice
              run. When you configure practice runs with zonal autoshift for a
              resource, you specify Amazon CloudWatch alarms, which you create
              in  CloudWatch to use with the practice run. The alarms that you
              specify are an outcome alarm ,  to  monitor  application  health
              during  practice  runs  and,  optionally,  a blocking alarm , to
              block practice runs from starting or to interrupt a practice run
              in progress.

              Control condition alarms do not apply for autoshifts.

              For  more  information,  see  Considerations  when you configure
              zonal autoshift in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Con-
              troller Developer Guide.

                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an Amazon CloudWatch alarm
                 that you specify as a control condition for a practice run.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of alarm specified for a practice run. You can  only
                 specify  Amazon  CloudWatch  alarms for practice runs, so the
                 only valid value is CLOUDWATCH .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          alarmIdentifier=string,type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "alarmIdentifier": "string",
              "type": "CLOUDWATCH"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --resource-identifier (string)
          The identifier for the resource that you want to update the practice
          run  configuration  for.  The identifier is the Amazon Resource Name
          (ARN) for the resource.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

              DAY:HH:MM-DAY:HH:MM   ,   separated   by  spaces.  For  example,
