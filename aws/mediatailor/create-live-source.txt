OPTIONS
       --http-package-configurations (list)
          A  list  of  HTTP  package  configuration  parameters  for this live
          source.

          (structure)
              The HTTP package configuration properties for the requested  VOD
              source.

              Path -> (string)
                 The  relative  path  to  the URL for this VOD source. This is
                 combined with  SourceLocation::HttpConfiguration::BaseUrl  to
                 form a valid URL.

              SourceGroup -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the source group. This has to match one of the
                 Channel::Outputs::SourceGroup.

              Type -> (string)
                 The streaming protocol for this package  configuration.  Sup-
                 ported values are HLS and DASH.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Path=string,SourceGroup=string,Type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Path": "string",
              "SourceGroup": "string",
              "Type": "DASH"|"HLS"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --live-source-name (string)
          The identifier for the live source you are working on.

       --source-location-name (string)
          The identifier for the source location you are working on.

       --tags (map)
          The tags to assign to the live source.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
