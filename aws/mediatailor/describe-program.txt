OPTIONS
       --channel-name (string)
          The name of the channel associated with this Program.

       --program-name (string)
          The name of the program.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

OUTPUT
       AdBreaks -> (list)
          The ad break configuration settings.

          (structure)

                     The  slate  VOD  source name. The VOD source must already
                     exist in a source location before  it  can  be  used  for
                     slate.

              SpliceInsertMessage -> (structure)
                 This  defines  the  SCTE-35  splice_insert() message inserted
                 around the ad. For information about using splice_insert()  ,
                 see the SCTE-35 specficiaiton, section 9.7.3.1.

                 AvailNum -> (integer)
                     This  is  written to splice_insert.avail_num , as defined
                     in section 9.7.3.1 of the SCTE-35 specification. The  de-
                     fault value is 0 . Values must be between 0 and 256 , in-
                     clusive.

                 AvailsExpected -> (integer)

                     , inclusive.

                 SpliceEventId -> (integer)

                     fined in section 9.7.3.1 of  the  SCTE-35  specification.
                     The default value is 1 .

                 UniqueProgramId -> (integer)
                     This  is  written to splice_insert.unique_program_id , as
                     defined in section 9.7.3.1 of the SCTE-35  specification.
                     The default value is 0 . Values must be between 0 and 256
                     , inclusive.

              TimeSignalMessage -> (structure)
                 Defines the SCTE-35 time_signal message inserted  around  the
                 ad.

                 Programs  on  a channel's schedule can be configured with one
                 or more ad breaks. You can  attach  a  splice_insert  SCTE-35
                 message to the ad break. This message provides basic metadata
                 about the ad break.

                 See section 9.7.4 of the 2022 SCTE-35 specification for  more
                 information.

                 SegmentationDescriptors -> (list)
                     The  configurations for the SCTE-35 segmentation_descrip-
                     tor message(s) sent with the time_signal message.

                     (structure)
                        The segmentation_descriptor message  can  contain  ad-
                        vanced  metadata  fields, like content identifiers, to
                        convey a wide range of information about the ad break.
                        MediaTailor writes the ad metadata in the egress mani-
                        fest as part of the EXT-X-DATERANGE or EventStream  ad
                        marker's SCTE-35 data.
                            segmentation_descriptor messages must be sent with
                            the time_signal message type.
