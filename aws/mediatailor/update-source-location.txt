OPTIONS
       --access-configuration (structure)
          Access  configuration parameters. Configures the type of authentica-
          tion used to access content from your source location.

          AccessType -> (string)
              The type of authentication used to access content from  HttpCon-
              figuration::BaseUrl on your source location.
                 S3_SIGV4  - AWS Signature Version 4 authentication for Amazon
                 S3 hosted virtual-style access. If your source location  base
                 URL is an Amazon S3 bucket, MediaTailor can use AWS Signature
                 Version 4 (SigV4) authentication to access the  bucket  where
                 your  source content is stored. Your MediaTailor source loca-
                 tion baseURL must follow the S3 virtual hosted-style  request
                 URL              format.             For             example,
                 https://bucket-name.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/key-name.

              Before you can use S3_SIGV4 , you must meet these requirements:

              o You must allow MediaTailor to access your S3 bucket by  grant-
                ing mediatailor.amazonaws.com principal access in IAM. For in-
                formation about configuring access in IAM, see Access  manage-
                ment in the IAM User Guide.

              o The mediatailor.amazonaws.com service principal must have per-
                missions to read all top level  manifests  referenced  by  the
                VodSource packaging configurations.

              o The  caller  of the API must have s3:GetObject IAM permissions
                to read all top level manifests referenced by your MediaTailor
                VodSource packaging configurations.
                 AUTODETECT_SIGV4 - AWS Signature Version 4 authentication for
                 a set of supported services: MediaPackage Version 2 and  Ama-
                 zon  S3  hosted virtual-style access. If your source location
                 base URL is a MediaPackage Version 2 endpoint or an Amazon S3
                 bucket,  MediaTailor  can use AWS Signature Version 4 (SigV4)
                 authentication to access the resource where your source  con-
                 tent is stored.

              Before  you can use AUTODETECT_SIGV4 with a MediaPackage Version
              2 endpoint, you must meet these requirements:

              o You must grant MediaTailor access to  your  MediaPackage  end-
                point  by  granting mediatailor.amazonaws.com principal access
                in an Origin Access policy on the endpoint.

              o Your MediaTailor source location base URL must be a MediaPack-
                age V2 endpoint.

              o The  caller  of the API must have mediapackagev2:GetObject IAM
                permissions to read all top level manifests referenced by  the
                MediaTailor source packaging configurations.

              Before  you  can  use AUTODETECT_SIGV4 with an Amazon S3 bucket,
              you must meet these requirements:

              o You must grant MediaTailor access to your S3 bucket by  grant-
                ing  mediatailor.amazonaws.com  principal  access  in IAM. For
                more information about configuring access in IAM,  see  Access
                management in the IAM User Guide. .

              o The mediatailor.amazonaws.com service principal must have per-
                missions to read all top-level  manifests  referenced  by  the
                VodSource packaging configurations.

              o The  caller  of the API must have s3:GetObject IAM permissions
                to read all top level manifests referenced by your MediaTailor
                VodSource packaging configurations.

                 The  name  of the HTTP header used to supply the access token
                 in requests to the source location.

                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Secrets Manager se-
                 cret that contains the access token.

                 The  AWS Secrets Manager SecretString key associated with the
                 access token. MediaTailor uses the key  to  look  up  Secret-
                 String key and value pair containing the access token.

       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
