       sources. For more information about source locations, see Working  with
       source locations in the MediaTailor User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --source-location-name (string)
          The name of the source location.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       AccessConfiguration -> (structure)
          The access configuration for the source location.

          AccessType -> (string)
              The type of authentication used to access content from  HttpCon-
              figuration::BaseUrl  on  your  source  location. Accepted value:
              S3_SIGV4 .
                 S3_SIGV4 - AWS Signature Version 4 authentication for  Amazon
                 S3  hosted virtual-style access. If your source location base
                 URL is an Amazon S3 bucket, MediaTailor can use AWS Signature
                 Version  4  (SigV4) authentication to access the bucket where
                 your source content is stored. Your MediaTailor source  loca-
                 tion  baseURL must follow the S3 virtual hosted-style request
                 URL             format.             For              example,
                 https://bucket-name.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/key-name.

              Before you can use S3_SIGV4 , you must meet these requirements:

              o You  must allow MediaTailor to access your S3 bucket by grant-
                ing mediatailor.amazonaws.com principal access in IAM. For in-
                formation  about configuring access in IAM, see Access manage-
                ment in the IAM User Guide.

              o The mediatailor.amazonaws.com service principal must have per-
                missions  to  read  all  top level manifests referenced by the
                VodSource packaging configurations.

              o The caller of the API must have s3:GetObject  IAM  permissions
                to read all top level manifests referenced by your MediaTailor
                VodSource packaging configurations.

          SecretsManagerAccessTokenConfiguration -> (structure)
              AWS Secrets Manager access token configuration parameters.

              HeaderName -> (string)
                 The name of the HTTP header used to supply the  access  token
                 in requests to the source location.

              SecretArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Secrets Manager se-
                 cret that contains the access token.

              SecretStringKey -> (string)
                 The AWS Secrets Manager SecretString key associated with  the
                 access  token.  MediaTailor  uses  the key to look up Secret-
                 String key and value pair containing the access token.

       Arn -> (string)
          The ARN of the source location.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp that indicates when the source location was created.

       DefaultSegmentDeliveryConfiguration -> (structure)
          The default segment delivery configuration settings.

          BaseUrl -> (string)
              The hostname of the server that will be used to serve  segments.
              This string must include the protocol, such as https:// .

       HttpConfiguration -> (structure)
          The HTTP package configuration settings for the source location.

          BaseUrl -> (string)
              The  base  URL  for the source location host server. This string
              must include the protocol, such as https:// .

          fied.

          resource.

                 The base URL of the host or  path  of  the  segment  delivery
                 server that you're using to serve segments. This is typically
                 a content delivery network (CDN). The URL can be absolute  or
                 relative.  To  use an absolute URL include the protocol, such
                 as https://example.com/some/path .  To  use  a  relative  URL
                 specify the relative path, such as /some/path* .
