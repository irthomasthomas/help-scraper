NAME
       get-prefetch-schedule -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about the prefetch schedule for a specific playback
       configuration. If you call GetPrefetchSchedule on an  expired  prefetch
       schedule, MediaTailor returns an HTTP 404 status code.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The identifier for the playback configuration.

       --playback-configuration-name (string)
          The name of the playback configuration.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the prefetch schedule.

       Consumption -> (structure)
          Consumption settings determine how, and when, MediaTailor places the
          prefetched  ads  into ad breaks. Ad consumption occurs within a span
          of time that you define, called a consumption window . You can  des-
          ignate  which  ad breaks that MediaTailor fills with prefetch ads by
          setting avail matching criteria.

          AvailMatchingCriteria -> (list)
              If you only want  MediaTailor  to  insert  prefetched  ads  into
              avails  (ad  breaks) that match specific dynamic variables, such
              as scte.event_id, set the avail matching criteria.

              (structure)
                 MediaTailor only places (consumes) prefetched ads if  the  ad
                 break  meets  the  criteria defined by the dynamic variables.
                 This gives you granular control over which ad break to  place
                 the prefetched ads into.

                 As  an  example,  let's  say  that you set DynamicVariable to
                 scte.event_id and Operator to EQUALS, and your playback  con-
                 figuration        has        an        ADS       URL       of
                 https://my.ads.server.com/path?&podId=[scte.avail_num]&event=[scte.event_id]&duration=[session.avail_duration_secs].
                 And  the  prefetch  request  to the ADS contains these values
                 https://my.ads.server.com/path?&podId=3&event=my-awesome-event&duration=30.
                 MediaTailor  will  only insert the prefetched ads into the ad
                 break if has a SCTE  marker  with  an  event  id  of  my-awe-
                 some-event, since it must match the event id that MediaTailor
                 uses to query the ADS.

                 You can specify up  to  five  AvailMatchingCriteria.  If  you
                 specify  multiple AvailMatchingCriteria, MediaTailor combines
                 them to match using a logical AND. You can model  logical  OR
                 combinations by creating multiple prefetch schedules.

                 DynamicVariable -> (string)
                     The  dynamic  variable(s)  that MediaTailor should use as
                     avail matching  criteria.  MediaTailor  only  places  the
                     prefetched  ads  into  the avail if the avail matches the
                     criteria defined by the dynamic variable. For information
                     about  dynamic  variables, see Using dynamic ad variables
                     in the MediaTailor User Guide .

                     You can include up to 100 dynamic variables.

                 Operator -> (string)
                     For the DynamicVariable specified in  AvailMatchingCrite-
                     ria, the Operator that is used for the comparison.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time when MediaTailor no longer considers the prefetched ads
              for use  in  an  ad  break.  MediaTailor  automatically  deletes
              prefetch  schedules  no less than seven days after the end time.
              If you'd like to manually delete the prefetch schedule, you  can
              call DeletePrefetchSchedule.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The  time  when  prefetched  ads are considered for use in an ad
              break. If you don't specify StartTime, the  prefetched  ads  are
              available  after  MediaTailor retrives them from the ad decision
              server.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the prefetch schedule. The name must be unique among all
          prefetch  schedules  that are associated with the specified playback
          configuration.

       PlaybackConfigurationName -> (string)
          The name of the playback configuration to create the prefetch sched-
          ule for.

       Retrieval -> (structure)
          A  complex  type  that contains settings for prefetch retrieval from
          the ad decision server (ADS).

          DynamicVariables -> (map)
              The dynamic variables to use for  substitution  during  prefetch
              requests to the ad decision server (ADS).

              You  intially  configure  dynamic variables for the ADS URL when
              you set up your playback configuration. When you specify  Dynam-
              icVariables for prefetch retrieval, MediaTailor includes the dy-
              namic variables in the request to the ADS.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The  time  when  prefetch  retrieval  ends  for  the  ad  break.
              Prefetching  will  be attempted for manifest requests that occur
              at or before this time.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The time when prefetch retrievals can start for this  break.  Ad
              prefetching  will  be attempted for manifest requests that occur
              at or after this time. Defaults to  the  current  time.  If  not
              specified, the prefetch retrieval starts as soon as possible.

       StreamId -> (string)
          An  optional  stream  identifier  that  you  can specify in order to
          prefetch for multiple streams that use the same playback  configura-
          tion.
