LIST-PREFETCH-SCHEDULES()                            LIST-PREFETCH-SCHEDULES()



NAME
       list-prefetch-schedules -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the prefetch schedules for a playback configuration.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-prefetch-schedules  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: Items

OPTIONS
       --playback-configuration-name (string)
          Retrieves the prefetch schedule(s) for a specific playback  configu-
          ration.

       --stream-id (string)
          An  optional  filtering  parameter  whereby  MediaTailor filters the
          prefetch schedules to include only specific streams.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          Lists the prefetch schedules. An empty Items list doesn't mean there
          aren't more items to fetch, just that that page was empty.

          (structure)
              A  prefetch schedule allows you to tell MediaTailor to fetch and
              prepare certain ads before an ad break happens. For more  infor-
              mation about ad prefetching, see Using ad prefetching in the Me-
              diaTailor User Guide .

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the prefetch schedule.

              Consumption -> (structure)
                 Consumption settings determine  how,  and  when,  MediaTailor
                 places  the prefetched ads into ad breaks. Ad consumption oc-
                 curs within a span of time that you define, called a consump-
                 tion  window  .  You can designate which ad breaks that Medi-
                 aTailor fills with prefetch ads  by  setting  avail  matching
                 criteria.

                 AvailMatchingCriteria -> (list)
                     If  you  only  want  MediaTailor to insert prefetched ads
                     into avails (ad breaks) that match specific dynamic vari-
                     ables,  such  as  scte.event_id  , set the avail matching
                     criteria.

                     (structure)
                        MediaTailor only places (consumes) prefetched  ads  if
                        the ad break meets the criteria defined by the dynamic
                        variables. This gives you granular control over  which
                        ad break to place the prefetched ads into.

                        As  an example, let's say that you set DynamicVariable
                        to scte.event_id and Operator to  EQUALS  ,  and  your
                        playback    configuration    has   an   ADS   URL   of
                        https://my.ads.server.com/path?&po-
                        dId=[scte.avail_num]&event=[scte.event_id]&dura-
                        tion=[session.avail_duration_secs] . And the  prefetch
                        request    to    the   ADS   contains   these   values
                        https://my.ads.server.com/path?&podId=3&event=my-awe-
                        some-event&duration=30  . MediaTailor will only insert
                        the prefetched ads into the ad break  if  has  a  SCTE
                        marker with an event id of my-awesome-event , since it
                        must match the event id that MediaTailor uses to query
                        the ADS.

                        You  can specify up to five AvailMatchingCriteria . If
                        you specify multiple AvailMatchingCriteria , MediaTai-
                        lor  combines  them to match using a logical AND . You
                        can model logical OR combinations by creating multiple
                        prefetch schedules.

                        DynamicVariable -> (string)
                            The  dynamic  variable(s)  that MediaTailor should
                            use as avail matching criteria.  MediaTailor  only
                            places  the  prefetched  ads into the avail if the
                            avail matches the criteria defined by the  dynamic
                            variable. For information about dynamic variables,
                            see Using dynamic ad variables in the  MediaTailor
                            User Guide .

                            You can include up to 100 dynamic variables.

                        Operator -> (string)
                            For  the  DynamicVariable specified in AvailMatch-
                            ingCriteria , the Operator that is  used  for  the
                            comparison.

                 EndTime -> (timestamp)
                     The   time  when  MediaTailor  no  longer  considers  the
                     prefetched ads for use in an ad break. MediaTailor  auto-
                     matically  deletes  prefetch schedules no less than seven
                     days after the end time. If you'd like to manually delete
                     the  prefetch schedule, you can call DeletePrefetchSched-
                     ule .

                 StartTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time when prefetched ads are considered for use in an
                     ad break. If you don't specify StartTime , the prefetched
                     ads are available after MediaTailor  retrives  them  from
                     the ad decision server.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the prefetch schedule. The name must be unique
                 among all prefetch schedules that  are  associated  with  the
                 specified playback configuration.

              PlaybackConfigurationName -> (string)
                 The name of the playback configuration to create the prefetch
                 schedule for.

              Retrieval -> (structure)
                 A complex type that contains settings for prefetch  retrieval
                 from the ad decision server (ADS).

                 DynamicVariables -> (map)
                     The  dynamic  variables  to  use  for substitution during
                     prefetch requests to the ad decision server (ADS).

                     You initially configure dynamic variables for the ADS URL
                     when  you  set  up  your playback configuration. When you
                     specify DynamicVariables for  prefetch  retrieval,  Medi-
                     aTailor  includes the dynamic variables in the request to
                     the ADS.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 EndTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time when prefetch retrieval ends for the  ad  break.
                     Prefetching  will be attempted for manifest requests that
                     occur at or before this time.

                 StartTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time when prefetch  retrievals  can  start  for  this
                     break.  Ad prefetching will be attempted for manifest re-
                     quests that occur at or after this time. Defaults to  the
                     current  time.  If  not specified, the prefetch retrieval
                     starts as soon as possible.

              StreamId -> (string)
                 An optional stream identifier that you can specify  in  order
                 to  prefetch  for multiple streams that use the same playback
                 configuration.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Pagination token returned by the list request  when  results  exceed
          the  maximum  allowed.  Use  the token to fetch the next page of re-
          sults.
