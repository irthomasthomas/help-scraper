NAME
       list-playback-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves existing playback configurations. For information about Medi-
       aTailor configurations, see Working with Configurations in AWS  Elemen-
       tal MediaTailor .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-playback-configurations  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: Items

SYNOPSIS
            list-playback-configurations
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]

          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]

          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          Array of playback configurations. This might be  all  the  available
          configurations  or a subset, depending on the settings that you pro-
          vide and the total number of configurations stored.

          (structure)
              A playback configuration. For information about MediaTailor con-
              figurations,  see  Working  with configurations in AWS Elemental
              MediaTailor .

              AdDecisionServerUrl -> (string)
                 The URL for the ad decision server (ADS). This  includes  the
                 specification  of  static parameters and placeholders for dy-
                 namic  parameters.  AWS  Elemental  MediaTailor   substitutes
                 player-specific  and  session-specific  parameters  as needed
                 when calling the ADS. Alternately, for testing you  can  pro-
                 vide  a static VAST URL. The maximum length is 25,000 charac-
                 ters.

              AvailSuppression -> (structure)
                 The configuration for avail suppression,  also  known  as  ad
                 suppression.  For  more information about ad suppression, see
                 Ad Suppression .

                 FillPolicy -> (string)
                     Defines the policy to  apply  to  the  avail  suppression
                     mode.  BEHIND_LIVE_EDGE  will  always  use the full avail
                     suppression policy. AFTER_LIVE_EDGE mode can be  used  to
                     invoke  partial  ad  break  fills  when  a session starts
                     mid-break.

                 Mode -> (string)
                     Sets the ad suppression mode. By default, ad  suppression
                     is  off  and  all ad breaks are filled with ads or slate.
                     When Mode is set to BEHIND_LIVE_EDGE , ad suppression  is
                     active  and MediaTailor won't fill ad breaks on or behind
                     the ad suppression Value time in  the  manifest  lookback
                     window. When Mode is set to AFTER_LIVE_EDGE , ad suppres-
                     sion is active and MediaTailor won't fill ad breaks  that
                     are  within  the  live  edge  plus  the avail suppression
                     value.

                 Value -> (string)
                     A live edge offset time in  HH:MM:SS.  MediaTailor  won't
                     fill  ad  breaks  on  or behind this time in the manifest
                     lookback window. If Value is set to 00:00:00,  it  is  in
                     sync  with  the live edge, and MediaTailor won't fill any
                     ad breaks on or behind the live edge. If you set a  Value
                     time,  MediaTailor  won't fill any ad breaks on or behind
                     this time in the manifest lookback window.  For  example,
                     if you set 00:45:00, then MediaTailor will fill ad breaks
                     that occur within 45 minutes behind the  live  edge,  but
                     won't  fill  ad breaks on or behind 45 minutes behind the
                     live edge.

              Bumper -> (structure)
                 The configuration for bumpers. Bumpers  are  short  audio  or
                 video clips that play at the start or before the end of an ad
                 break. To learn more about bumpers, see Bumpers .

                 EndUrl -> (string)
                     The URL for the end bumper asset.

                 StartUrl -> (string)
                     The URL for the start bumper asset.

              CdnConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The configuration for using a content delivery network (CDN),
                 like  Amazon  CloudFront,  for content and ad segment manage-
                 ment.

                 AdSegmentUrlPrefix -> (string)
                     A non-default content delivery network (CDN) to serve  ad
                     segments. By default, AWS Elemental MediaTailor uses Ama-
                     zon CloudFront with default cache settings as its CDN for
                     ad segments. To set up an alternate CDN, create a rule in
                     your CDN for the origin ads.mediatailor.*<region>*  .ama-
                     zonaws.com.  Then  specify the rule's name in this AdSeg-
                     mentUrlPrefix . When AWS Elemental MediaTailor  serves  a
                     manifest,  it  reports your CDN as the source for ad seg-
                     ments.

                 ContentSegmentUrlPrefix -> (string)
                     A content delivery network (CDN) to  cache  content  seg-
                     ments, so that content requests dont always have to go to
                     the origin server. First, create a rule in your  CDN  for
                     the  content  segment  origin  server.  Then  specify the
                     rule's name in this ContentSegmentUrlPrefix  .  When  AWS
                     Elemental  MediaTailor serves a manifest, it reports your
                     CDN as the source for content segments.

              ConfigurationAliases -> (map)
                 The player parameters and aliases used as  dynamic  variables
                 during  session  initialization.  For  more  information, see
                 Domain Variables .

                 key -> (string)
                     The dynamic variable that has aliases.

                 value -> (map)
                     Map of aliases to the value to be used at request time.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

              DashConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The configuration for a DASH source.

                 ManifestEndpointPrefix -> (string)
                     The URL generated by MediaTailor to initiate  a  playback
                     session.  The  session  uses  server-side reporting. This
                     setting is ignored in PUT operations.

                 MpdLocation -> (string)
                     The setting that controls  whether  MediaTailor  includes
                     the Location tag in DASH manifests. MediaTailor populates
                     the Location tag with the URL  for  manifest  update  re-
                     quests,  to  be used by players that don't support sticky
                     redirects. Disable this if you have CDN routing rules set
                     up  for  accessing MediaTailor manifests, and you are ei-
                     ther using client-side reporting or your players  support
                     sticky  HTTP  redirects.  Valid  values  are DISABLED and
                     EMT_DEFAULT . The EMT_DEFAULT setting enables the  inclu-
                     sion of the tag and is the default value.

                 OriginManifestType -> (string)
                     The  setting  that  controls  whether MediaTailor handles
                     manifests from the origin server  as  multi-period  mani-
                     fests  or  single-period manifests. If your origin server
                     produces single-period manifests, set this to  SINGLE_PE-
                     RIOD   .  The  default  setting  is  MULTI_PERIOD  .  For
                     multi-period manifests, omit this setting or  set  it  to
                     MULTI_PERIOD .

              HlsConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The configuration for HLS content.

                 ManifestEndpointPrefix -> (string)
                     The  URL  that is used to initiate a playback session for
                     devices  that  support  Apple  HLS.  The   session   uses
                     server-side reporting.

              LivePreRollConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The configuration for pre-roll ad insertion.

                 AdDecisionServerUrl -> (string)
                     The  URL  for  the  ad decision server (ADS) for pre-roll
                     ads. This includes the specification of static parameters
                     and  placeholders  for  dynamic parameters. AWS Elemental
                     MediaTailor substitutes player-specific and  session-spe-
                     cific  parameters  as needed when calling the ADS. Alter-
                     nately, for testing, you can provide a static  VAST  URL.
                     The maximum length is 25,000 characters.

                 MaxDurationSeconds -> (integer)
                     The  maximum  allowed duration for the pre-roll ad avail.
                     AWS Elemental MediaTailor won't play pre-roll ads to  ex-
                     ceed  this  duration, regardless of the total duration of
                     ads that the ADS returns.

              LogConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The Amazon CloudWatch log settings for a playback  configura-
                 tion.

                 PercentEnabled -> (integer)
                     The  percentage of session logs that MediaTailor sends to
                     your Cloudwatch Logs account. For example, if your  play-
                     back  configuration  has 1000 sessions and percentEnabled
                     is set to 60 , MediaTailor sends logs for 600 of the ses-
                     sions  to  CloudWatch Logs. MediaTailor decides at random
                     which of the playback configuration sessions to send logs
                     for. If you want to view logs for a specific session, you
                     can use the debug log mode .

                     Valid values: 0 - 100

              ManifestProcessingRules -> (structure)
                 The configuration for  manifest  processing  rules.  Manifest
                 processing  rules  enable  customization  of the personalized
                 manifests created by MediaTailor.

                 AdMarkerPassthrough -> (structure)
                     For HLS, when set to true ,  MediaTailor  passes  through
                     EXT-X-CUE-IN   ,   EXT-X-CUE-OUT   ,   and  EXT-X-SPLICE-
                     POINT-SCTE35 ad markers from the origin manifest  to  the
                     MediaTailor personalized manifest.

                     No  logic is applied to these ad markers. For example, if
                     EXT-X-CUE-OUT has a value of 60 , but no ads  are  filled
                     for  that ad break, MediaTailor will not set the value to
                     0 .

                     Enabled -> (boolean)
                        Enables ad marker passthrough for your configuration.

              Name -> (string)
                 The identifier for the playback configuration.

              PersonalizationThresholdSeconds -> (integer)
                 Defines the maximum duration of underfilled ad time (in  sec-
                 onds)  allowed in an ad break. If the duration of underfilled
                 ad time exceeds the personalization threshold, then the  per-
                 sonalization  of the ad break is abandoned and the underlying
                 content is shown. This feature applies to ad  replacement  in
                 live  and  VOD  streams, rather than ad insertion, because it
                 relies on an underlying content stream. For more  information
                 about  ad break behavior, including ad replacement and inser-
                 tion, see Ad Behavior in AWS Elemental MediaTailor .

              PlaybackConfigurationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for  the  playback  configura-
                 tion.

              PlaybackEndpointPrefix -> (string)
                 The  URL  that the player accesses to get a manifest from AWS
                 Elemental MediaTailor.

              SessionInitializationEndpointPrefix -> (string)
                 The URL that the player uses to  initialize  a  session  that
                 uses client-side reporting.

              SlateAdUrl -> (string)
                 The  URL  for  a  video asset to transcode and use to fill in
                 time that's not used by ads. AWS Elemental MediaTailor  shows
                 the  slate  to fill in gaps in media content. Configuring the
                 slate is optional for non-VPAID playback configurations.  For
                 VPAID,  the slate is required because MediaTailor provides it
                 in the slots designated for dynamic  ad  content.  The  slate
                 must  be  a  high-quality  asset that contains both audio and
                 video.

              Tags -> (map)
                 The tags to assign to the playback  configuration.  Tags  are
                 key-value  pairs that you can associate with Amazon resources
                 to help with organization, access control, and cost tracking.

                 Resources .

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              TranscodeProfileName -> (string)
                 The name that is used to associate this  playback  configura-
                 tion  with a custom transcode profile. This overrides the dy-
                 namic transcoding defaults of MediaTailor. Use this  only  if
                 you  have already set up custom profiles with the help of AWS
                 Support.

              VideoContentSourceUrl -> (string)
                 The URL prefix for the parent manifest for the stream,  minus
                 the asset ID. The maximum length is 512 characters.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Pagination  token  returned by the GET list request when results ex-
          ceed the maximum allowed. Use the token to fetch the  next  page  of
          results.
