LIST-SOURCE-LOCATIONS()                                LIST-SOURCE-LOCATIONS()



NAME
       list-source-locations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a list of source locations.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-source-locations  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Items

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          A list of source locations.

          (structure)
              This response includes only the "type" : "object" property.

              AccessConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The access configuration for the source location.

                 AccessType -> (string)
                     The type of authentication used to  access  content  from
                     HttpConfiguration::BaseUrl  on  your source location. Ac-
                     cepted value: S3_SIGV4.

                     S3_SIGV4 - AWS Signature  Version  4  authentication  for
                     Amazon S3 hosted virtual-style access. If your source lo-
                     cation base URL is an Amazon S3 bucket,  MediaTailor  can
                     use AWS Signature Version 4 (SigV4) authentication to ac-
                     cess the bucket where your source content is stored. Your
                     MediaTailor  source  location  baseURL must follow the S3
                     virtual hosted-style request  URL  format.  For  example,
                     https://bucket-name.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/key-name.

                     Before you can use S3_SIGV4, you must meet these require-
                     ments:

                     o You must allow MediaTailor to access your S3 bucket  by
                       granting  mediatailor.amazonaws.com principal access in
                       IAM. For information about configuring access  in  IAM,
                       see Access management in the IAM User Guide.

                     o The  mediatailor.amazonaws.com  service  principal must
                       have permissions to read all top level manifests refer-
                       enced by the VodSource packaging configurations.

                     o The  caller  of the API must have s3:GetObject IAM per-
                       missions to read all top level manifests referenced  by
                       your MediaTailor VodSource packaging configurations.

                     SecretArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Secrets Man-

                     SecretStringKey -> (string)
                        The AWS Secrets Manager  SecretString  key  associated
                        with  the  access  token.  MediaTailor uses the key to
                        look up SecretString key and value pair containing the
                        access token.
