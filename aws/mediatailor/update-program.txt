OPTIONS
       --ad-breaks (list)
          The ad break configuration settings.

          (structure)
              Ad break configuration parameters.

              AdBreakMetadata -> (list)
                 Defines  a list of key/value pairs that MediaTailor generates
                 within the EXT-X-ASSET tag for SCTE35_ENHANCED output.

                 (structure)
                     For SCTE35_ENHANCED output, defines a key and correspond-
                     ing  value.  MediaTailor generates these pairs within the
                     EXT-X-ASSET tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        For SCTE35_ENHANCED output, defines a key. MediaTailor
                        takes  this  key, and its associated value, and gener-
                        ates the key/value pair within the EXT-X-ASSET tag. If
                        you specify a key, you must also specify a correspond-
                        ing value.

                     Value -> (string)
                        For SCTE35_ENHANCED output, defines a value. MediaTai-
                        lor;  takes  this  value,  and its associated key, and
                        generates the key/value pair  within  the  EXT-X-ASSET
                        tag.  If  you specify a value, you must also specify a
                        corresponding key.

              MessageType -> (string)
                 The SCTE-35 ad insertion type. Accepted value:  SPLICE_INSERT
                 , TIME_SIGNAL .

              OffsetMillis -> (long)
                 How long (in milliseconds) after the beginning of the program
                 that an ad starts. This value must fall  within  100ms  of  a
                 segment boundary, otherwise the ad break will be skipped.

              Slate -> (structure)
                 Ad break slate configuration.

                 SourceLocationName -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  source  location  where the slate VOD
                     source is stored.

                 VodSourceName -> (string)
                     The slate VOD source name. The VOD  source  must  already
                     exist  in  a  source  location  before it can be used for
                     slate.

              SpliceInsertMessage -> (structure)
                 This defines the  SCTE-35  splice_insert()  message  inserted
                 around  the ad. For information about using splice_insert() ,
                 see the SCTE-35 specficiaiton, section 9.7.3.1.

                 AvailNum -> (integer)
                     This is written to splice_insert.avail_num ,  as  defined
                     in  section 9.7.3.1 of the SCTE-35 specification. The de-
                     fault value is 0 . Values must be between 0 and 256 , in-
                     clusive.

                 AvailsExpected -> (integer)
                     This is written to splice_insert.avails_expected , as de-
                     fined in section 9.7.3.1 of  the  SCTE-35  specification.
                     The default value is 0 . Values must be between 0 and 256
                     , inclusive.

                 SpliceEventId -> (integer)
                     This is written to splice_insert.splice_event_id , as de-
                     fined  in  section  9.7.3.1 of the SCTE-35 specification.
                     The default value is 1 .

                 UniqueProgramId -> (integer)
                     This is written to splice_insert.unique_program_id  ,  as
                     defined  in section 9.7.3.1 of the SCTE-35 specification.
                     The default value is 0 . Values must be between 0 and 256
                     , inclusive.

              TimeSignalMessage -> (structure)
                 Defines  the  SCTE-35 time_signal message inserted around the
                 ad.

                 Programs on a channel's schedule can be configured  with  one
                 or  more  ad  breaks.  You can attach a splice_insert SCTE-35
                 message to the ad break. This message provides basic metadata
                 about the ad break.

                 See  section 9.7.4 of the 2022 SCTE-35 specification for more
                 information.

                 SegmentationDescriptors -> (list)
                     The configurations for the SCTE-35  segmentation_descrip-
                     tor message(s) sent with the time_signal message.

                     (structure)
                        The  segmentation_descriptor  message  can contain ad-
                        vanced metadata fields, like content  identifiers,  to
                        convey a wide range of information about the ad break.
                        MediaTailor writes the ad metadata in the egress mani-
                        fest  as part of the EXT-X-DATERANGE or EventStream ad
                        marker's SCTE-35 data.
                            segmentation_descriptor messages must be sent with
                            the time_signal message type.

                        See  the  segmentation_descriptor()  table of the 2022
                        SCTE-35 specification for more information.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument

                        generates the key/value pair  within  the  EXT-X-ASSET
                        tag.  If  you specify a value, you must also specify a
                        corresponding key.

                     The slate VOD source name. The VOD  source  must  already
                     exist  in  a  source  location  before it can be used for
                     slate.

              SpliceInsertMessage -> (structure)
                 This defines the  SCTE-35  splice_insert()  message  inserted

                 Programs on a channel's schedule can be configured  with  one
                 or  more  ad  breaks.  You can attach a splice_insert SCTE-35
                 message to the ad break. This message provides basic metadata
                 about the ad break.

                     tor message(s) sent with the time_signal message.

                     (structure)
                        The  segmentation_descriptor  message  can contain ad-
                        vanced metadata fields, like content  identifiers,  to
                        convey a wide range of information about the ad break.
                        MediaTailor writes the ad metadata in the egress mani-
                        fest  as part of the EXT-X-DATERANGE or EventStream ad
                        marker's SCTE-35 data.

                                      key. MediaTailor takes this key, and its
                                      associated   value,  and  generates  the
                                      key/value pair  within  the  EXT-X-ASSET
                                      tag. If you specify a key, you must also
                                      specify a corresponding value.
