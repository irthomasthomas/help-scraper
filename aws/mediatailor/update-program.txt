OPTIONS
       --ad-breaks (list)
          The ad break configuration settings.

          (structure)
              Ad break configuration parameters.

              MessageType -> (string)

                 How long (in milliseconds) after the beginning of the program
                 that  an  ad  starts.  This value must fall within 100ms of a
                 segment boundary, otherwise the ad break will be skipped.

              Slate -> (structure)
                 Ad break slate configuration.

                 SourceLocationName -> (string)
                     The name of the  source  location  where  the  slate  VOD
                     source is stored.

                 VodSourceName -> (string)
                     The  slate  VOD  source name. The VOD source must already
                     exist in a source location before  it  can  be  used  for
                     slate.

              SpliceInsertMessage -> (structure)
                 This  defines  the  SCTE-35  splice_insert() message inserted
                 around the ad. For information about using splice_insert()  ,
                 see the SCTE-35 specficiaiton, section 9.7.3.1.

                 AvailNum -> (integer)
                     This  is  written to splice_insert.avail_num , as defined
                     in section 9.7.3.1 of the SCTE-35 specification. The  de-
                     fault value is 0 . Values must be between 0 and 256 , in-
                     clusive.

                 AvailsExpected -> (integer)
                     This is written to splice_insert.avails_expected , as de-
                     fined  in  section  9.7.3.1 of the SCTE-35 specification.
                     The default value is 0 . Values must be between 0 and 256
                     , inclusive.

                 SpliceEventId -> (integer)
                     This is written to splice_insert.splice_event_id , as de-
                     fined in section 9.7.3.1 of  the  SCTE-35  specification.
                     The default value is 1 .

                 UniqueProgramId -> (integer)
                     This  is  written to splice_insert.unique_program_id , as
                     defined in section 9.7.3.1 of the SCTE-35  specification.
                     The default value is 0 . Values must be between 0 and 256
                     , inclusive.

              TimeSignalMessage -> (structure)
                 Defines the SCTE-35 time_signal message inserted  around  the
                 ad.

                 Programs  on  a channel's schedule can be configured with one
                 or more ad breaks. You can  attach  a  splice_insert  SCTE-35
                 message to the ad break. This message provides basic metadata
                 about the ad break.

                 See section 9.7.4 of the 2022 SCTE-35 specification for  more
                 information.

                 SegmentationDescriptors -> (list)
                     The  configurations for the SCTE-35 segmentation_descrip-
                     tor message(s) sent with the time_signal message.

                     (structure)
                        The segmentation_descriptor message  can  contain  ad-
                        vanced  metadata  fields, like content identifiers, to
                        convey a wide range of information about the ad break.
                        MediaTailor writes the ad metadata in the egress mani-
                        fest as part of the EXT-X-DATERANGE or EventStream  ad
                        marker's SCTE-35 data.
                            segmentation_descriptor messages must be sent with
                            the time_signal message type.

                        See the segmentation_descriptor() table  of  the  2022

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON

       the string will be taken literally.

              TimeSignalMessage -> (structure)
                 Defines  the  SCTE-35 time_signal message inserted around the
                 ad.

                 Programs on a channel's schedule can be configured  with  one
                 or  more  ad  breaks.  You can attach a splice_insert SCTE-35
                 message to the ad break. This message provides basic metadata
                 about the ad break.

                 See  section 9.7.4 of the 2022 SCTE-35 specification for more
                 information.

                     (structure)
                        The  segmentation_descriptor  message  can contain ad-
                        vanced metadata fields, like content  identifiers,  to
                        convey a wide range of information about the ad break.
                        MediaTailor writes the ad metadata in the egress mani-
                        fest  as part of the EXT-X-DATERANGE or EventStream ad
                        marker's SCTE-35 data.
