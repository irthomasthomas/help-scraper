DESCRIPTION
       The AWS User Notifications API Reference provides descriptions, API re-
       quest parameters, and the JSON response for each of the User  Notifica-
       tion API actions.

       User Notification control APIs are currently available in US East (Vir-
       ginia) - us-east-1 .
          GetNotificationEvent and ListNotificationEvents APIs  are  currently
          available  in commercial partition Regions and only return notifica-
          tions stored in the same Region in which they're called.

       The User Notifications console can only be used in US East  (Virginia).
       Your data however, is stored in each Region chosen as a
       `notification hub <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/notifications/latest/userguide/notification-hubs.html>>`__
        in addition to US East (Virginia).
