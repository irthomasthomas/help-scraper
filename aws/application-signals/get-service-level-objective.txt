OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The  ARN  or  name  of the SLO that you want to retrieve information
          about.  You   can   find   the   ARNs   of   SLOs   by   using   the
          ListServiceLevelObjectives operation.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          Sli -> (structure)
              A structure containing information about the performance  metric
              that this SLO monitors.

              SliMetric -> (structure)
                 A  structure  that contains information about the metric that
                 the SLO monitors.

                 KeyAttributes -> (map)
                     This is a string-to-string map that contains  information
                     about  the type of object that this SLO is related to. It
                     can include the following fields.

                     o Type designates the type of object that this SLO is re-
                       lated to.

                     o ResourceType  specifies  the type of the resource. This
                       field is used only when the value of the Type field  is
                       Resource or AWS::Resource .

                     o Name  specifies  the  name  of the object. This is used
                       only if the value of the Type field is  Service  ,  Re-
                       moteService , or AWS::Service .

                     o Identifier  identifies the resource objects of this re-
                       source. This is used only if  the  value  of  the  Type
                       field is Resource or AWS::Resource .

                     o Environment specifies the location where this object is
                       hosted, or what it belongs to.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 OperationName -> (string)
                     If the SLO monitors a specific operation of the  service,
                     this field displays that operation name.

                 MetricType -> (string)
                     If  the  SLO  monitors either the LATENCY or AVAILABILITY
                     metric that Application Signals collects, this field dis-
                     plays which of those metrics is used.

                 MetricDataQueries -> (list)
                     If this SLO monitors a CloudWatch metric or the result of
                     a CloudWatch metric math expression, this  structure  in-
                     cludes the information about that metric or expression.

                     (structure)
                        Use  this  structure to define a metric or metric math
                        expression that you want to use as for a service level
                        objective.

                        Each  MetricDataQuery  in  the MetricDataQueries array
                        specifies either a metric to  retrieve,  or  a  metric
                        math  expression to be performed on retrieved metrics.
                        A single MetricDataQueries array can include  as  many
                        as  20 MetricDataQuery structures in the array. The 20
                        structures can include as many as 10  structures  that
                        contain  a  MetricStat parameter to retrieve a metric,
                        and as many as 10 structures that contain the  Expres-
                        sion  parameter to perform a math expression. Of those
                        Expression structures, exactly one must have  true  as
                        the  value for ReturnData . The result of this expres-
                        sion used for the SLO.

                        For more information about  metric  math  expressions,
                        see CloudWatchUse metric math .

                        Within  each  MetricDataQuery object, you must specify
                        either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                        Id -> (string)
                            A short name used to tie this object  to  the  re-
                            sults  in  the  response.  This  Id must be unique
                            within a MetricDataQueries array. If you are  per-
                            forming math expressions on this set of data, this
                            name represents that data and can serve as a vari-
                            able  in  the  metric  math  expression. The valid
                            characters are letters, numbers,  and  underscore.
                            The first character must be a lowercase letter.

                        MetricStat -> (structure)
                            A metric to be used directly for the SLO, or to be
                            used in the math expression that will be used  for
                            the SLO.

                            Within  one MetricDataQuery object, you must spec-
                            ify either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                            Metric -> (structure)
                               The metric to use as the service level  indica-
                               tor,  including the metric name, namespace, and
                               dimensions.

                               Namespace -> (string)
                                   The namespace of the metric. For  more  in-
                                   formation, see Namespaces .

                               MetricName -> (string)
                                   The name of the metric to use.

                               Dimensions -> (list)
                                   An  array  of one or more dimensions to use
                                   to define the metric that you want to  use.
                                   For more information, see Dimensions .

                                   (structure)
                                      A dimension is a name/value pair that is
                                      part of the identity of  a  metric.  Be-
                                      cause  dimensions are part of the unique
                                      identifier for a  metric,  whenever  you
                                      add  a  unique name/value pair to one of
                                      your metrics, you  are  creating  a  new
                                      variation  of  that metric. For example,
                                      many Amazon EC2 metrics publish  Instan-
                                      ceId as a dimension name, and the actual
                                      instance ID as the value for that dimen-
                                      sion.

                                      You  can assign up to 30 dimensions to a
                                      metric.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the dimension. Dimension
                                          names  must contain only ASCII char-
                                          acters, must include  at  least  one
                                          non-whitespace character, and cannot
                                          start with a colon (: ). ASCII  con-
                                          trol characters are not supported as
                                          part of dimension names.

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          The value of the  dimension.  Dimen-
                                          sion  values must contain only ASCII
                                          characters and must include at least
                                          one  non-whitespace character. ASCII
                                          control characters are not supported
                                          as part of dimension values.

                            Period -> (integer)
                               The granularity, in seconds, to be used for the
                               metric. For metrics with regular resolution,  a
                               period  can  be as short as one minute (60 sec-
                               onds)  and  must  be  a  multiple  of  60.  For
                               high-resolution  metrics  that are collected at
                               intervals of less than one minute,  the  period
                               can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60.
                               High-resolution  metrics  are   those   metrics
                               stored  by a PutMetricData call that includes a
                               StorageResolution of 1 second.

                            Stat -> (string)
                               The statistic to  use  for  comparison  to  the
                               threshold.  It  can be any CloudWatch statistic
                               or extended  statistic.  For  more  information
                               about  statistics,  see  CloudWatch  statistics
                               definitions .

                            Unit -> (string)
                               If you omit Unit then all data  that  was  col-
                               lected  with  any  unit is returned, along with
                               the corresponding  units  that  were  specified
                               when  the  data  was reported to CloudWatch. If
                               you specify a unit, the operation returns  only
                               data  that  was collected with that unit speci-
                               fied. If you specify a unit that does not match
                               the  data  collected, the results of the opera-
                               tion are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit
                               conversions.

                        Expression -> (string)
                            This field can contain a metric math expression to
                            be performed on the other metrics that you are re-
                            trieving within this MetricDataQueries structure.

                            A math expression can use the Id of the other met-
                            rics or queries to refer to those metrics, and can
                            also  use  the  Id of other expressions to use the
                            result of those expressions. For more  information
                            about  metric  math  expressions,  see Metric Math
                            Syntax and Functions in the Amazon CloudWatch User
                            Guide .

                            Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must spec-
                            ify either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                        Label -> (string)
                            A human-readable label for this metric or  expres-
                            sion.  This is especially useful if this is an ex-
                            pression, so that you know what the  value  repre-
                            sents.  If  the metric or expression is shown in a
                            CloudWatch dashboard widget, the label  is  shown.
                            If  Label  is  omitted, CloudWatch generates a de-
                            fault.

                            You can put dynamic expressions into a  label,  so
                            that it is more descriptive. For more information,
                            see Using Dynamic Labels .

                        ReturnData -> (boolean)
                            Use this only if you are using a metric  math  ex-
                            pression  for the SLO. Specify true for ReturnData
                            for only the one expression result to use  as  the
                            alarm.  For  all  other metrics and expressions in
                            the  same  CreateServiceLevelObjective  operation,
                            specify ReturnData as false .

                        Period -> (integer)
                            The  granularity, in seconds, of the returned data
                            points for this metric. For metrics  with  regular
                            resolution, a period can be as short as one minute
                            (60 seconds) and must be a  multiple  of  60.  For
                            high-resolution  metrics that are collected at in-
                            tervals of less than one minute, the period can be
                            1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-res-
                            olution metrics are those metrics stored by a Put-
                            MetricData  call that includes a StorageResolution
                            of 1 second.

                            If the StartTime parameter specifies a time  stamp
                            that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify
                            the period as follows or no data  points  in  that
                            time range is returned:

                            o Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use
                              a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).

                            o Start time between 15 and 63 days ago  -  Use  a
                              multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).

                            o Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a mul-
                              tiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).

                        AccountId -> (string)
                            The ID of the account where  this  metric  is  lo-
                            cated.  If you are performing this operatiion in a
                            monitoring account,  use  this  to  specify  which
                            source account to retrieve this metric from.

              MetricThreshold -> (double)
                 The value that the SLI metric is compared to.

              ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                 The  arithmetic  operation  used when comparing the specified
                 metric to the threshold.

          Goal -> (structure)
              This structure contains the attributes that determine  the  goal
              of  an SLO. This includes the time period for evaluation and the
              attainment threshold.

              Interval -> (tagged union structure)
                 The time period used to evaluate the SLO. It can be either  a
                 calendar interval or rolling interval.

                 If  you  omit this parameter, a rolling interval of 7 days is
                 used.

                 NOTE:
                     This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the follow-
                     ing top level keys can be set: RollingInterval, Calendar-
                     Interval.

                 RollingInterval -> (structure)
                     If the interval is a  rolling  interval,  this  structure
                     contains the interval specifications.

                     DurationUnit -> (string)
                        Specifies the rolling interval unit.

                     Duration -> (integer)
                        Specifies  the  duration of each rolling interval. For
                        example, if Duration is 7 and DurationUnit  is  DAY  ,
                        each rolling interval is seven days.

                 CalendarInterval -> (structure)
                     If  the  interval  is a calendar interval, this structure
                     contains the interval specifications.

                     StartTime -> (timestamp)
                        The date and time when you want the first interval  to
                        start.  Be  sure  to choose a time that configures the
                        intervals the way that you want. For example,  if  you
                        want  weekly  intervals starting on Mondays at 6 a.m.,
                        be sure to specify a start time that is a Monday at  6
                        a.m.

                        When  used in a raw HTTP Query API, it is formatted as
                        be epoch time in seconds. For example: 1698778057

                        As soon as one calendar interval ends,  another  auto-
                        matically begins.

                     DurationUnit -> (string)
                        Specifies the calendar interval unit.

                     Duration -> (integer)
                        Specifies  the duration of each calendar interval. For
                        example, if Duration is 1 and DurationUnit is MONTH  ,
                        each interval is one month, aligned with the calendar.

              AttainmentGoal -> (double)
                 The  threshold  that  determines if the goal is being met. An
                 attainment goal is the ratio of good periods  that  meet  the
                 threshold requirements to the total periods within the inter-
                 val. For example, an attainment  goal  of  99.9%  means  that
                 within  your interval, you are targeting 99.9% of the periods
                 to be in healthy state.

                 If you omit this parameter, 99 is used to  represent  99%  as
                 the attainment goal.

              WarningThreshold -> (double)
                 The percentage of remaining budget over total budget that you
                 want to get warnings for. If you omit this parameter, the de-
                 fault of 50.0 is used.
