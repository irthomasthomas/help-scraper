NAME
       update-service-level-objective -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  an existing service level objective (SLO). If you omit parame-
       ters, the previous values of those parameters are retained.

       You cannot change from a period-based SLO to a  request-based  SLO,  or
       change from a request-based SLO to a period-based SLO.

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) or name of the service level objec-
          tive that you want to update.

       --description (string)
          An optional description for the SLO.

       --sli-config (structure)
          If this SLO is a period-based SLO, this structure defines the infor-
          mation about what performance metric this SLO will monitor.

          SliMetricConfig -> (structure)
              Use this structure to specify the metric to be used for the SLO.

              KeyAttributes -> (map)
                 If  this  SLO is related to a metric collected by Application
                 Signals, you must use this field to specify which service the
                 SLO metric is related to. To do so, you must specify at least
                 the Type , Name , and Environment attributes.

                 This is a string-to-string map. It can include the  following
                 fields.

                 o Type designates the type of object this is.

                 o ResourceType specifies the type of the resource. This field
                   is used only when the value of the Type field  is  Resource
                   or AWS::Resource .

                 o Name specifies the name of the object. This is used only if
                   the value of the Type field is Service , RemoteService , or
                   AWS::Service .

                 o Identifier  identifies  the  resource  objects  of this re-
                   source. This is used only if the value of the Type field is
                   Resource or AWS::Resource .

                 o Environment  specifies  the  location  where this object is
                   hosted, or what it belongs to.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              OperationName -> (string)
                 If the SLO is to monitor a specific operation of the service,
                 use this field to specify the name of that operation.

              MetricType -> (string)
                 If  the  SLO is to monitor either the LATENCY or AVAILABILITY
                 metric that Application Signals collects, use this  field  to
                 specify which of those metrics is used.

              Statistic -> (string)
                 The  statistic to use for comparison to the threshold. It can
                 be any CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic.  For  more
                 information about statistics, see CloudWatch statistics defi-
                 nitions .

              PeriodSeconds -> (integer)
                 The number of seconds to use as the period  for  SLO  evalua-
                 tion.  Your  application's performance is compared to the SLI
                 during each period. For each period, the application  is  de-
                 termined  to  have either achieved or not achieved the neces-
                 sary performance.

              MetricDataQueries -> (list)
                 If this SLO monitors a CloudWatch metric or the result  of  a
                 CloudWatch  metric  math  expression,  use  this structure to
                 specify that metric or expression.

                 (structure)
                     Use this structure to define a metric or metric math  ex-
                     pression  that you want to use as for a service level ob-
                     jective.

                     Each MetricDataQuery in the MetricDataQueries array spec-
                     ifies  either  a metric to retrieve, or a metric math ex-
                     pression to be performed on retrieved metrics.  A  single
                     MetricDataQueries array can include as many as 20 Metric-
                     DataQuery structures in the array. The 20 structures  can
                     include  as  many as 10 structures that contain a Metric-
                     Stat parameter to retrieve a metric, and as  many  as  10
                     structures  that contain the Expression parameter to per-
                     form a math expression. Of those  Expression  structures,
                     exactly  one must have true as the value for ReturnData .
                     The result of this expression used for the SLO.

                     For more information about metric math  expressions,  see
                     CloudWatchUse metric math .

                     Within  each MetricDataQuery object, you must specify ei-
                     ther Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                     Id -> (string)
                        A short name used to tie this object to the results in
                        the  response. This Id must be unique within a Metric-
                        DataQueries array. If you are performing math  expres-
                        sions  on  this set of data, this name represents that
                        data and can serve as a variable in  the  metric  math
                        expression. The valid characters are letters, numbers,
                        and underscore. The first character must be  a  lower-
                        case letter.

                     MetricStat -> (structure)
                        A  metric  to  be  used directly for the SLO, or to be
                        used in the math expression that will be used for  the
                        SLO.

                        Within  one  MetricDataQuery  object, you must specify
                        either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                        Metric -> (structure)
                            The metric to use as the service level  indicator,
                            including  the  metric name, namespace, and dimen-
                            sions.

                            Namespace -> (string)
                               The namespace of the metric. For more  informa-
                               tion, see Namespaces .

                            MetricName -> (string)
                               The name of the metric to use.

                            Dimensions -> (list)
                               An  array  of  one or more dimensions to use to
                               define the metric that you  want  to  use.  For
                               more information, see Dimensions .

                               (structure)
                                   A  dimension  is  a name/value pair that is
                                   part of the identity of a  metric.  Because
                                   dimensions  are  part of the unique identi-
                                   fier for  a  metric,  whenever  you  add  a
                                   unique  name/value pair to one of your met-
                                   rics, you are creating a new  variation  of
                                   that  metric.  For example, many Amazon EC2
                                   metrics publish InstanceId as  a  dimension
                                   name,  and  the  actual  instance ID as the
                                   value for that dimension.

                                   You can assign up to  30  dimensions  to  a
                                   metric.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the  dimension. Dimension
                                      names must contain  only  ASCII  charac-
                                      ters,   must   include   at   least  one
                                      non-whitespace  character,  and   cannot
                                      start  with  a colon (: ). ASCII control
                                      characters are not supported as part  of
                                      dimension names.

                                   Value -> (string)
                                      The  value  of  the dimension. Dimension
                                      values must contain only  ASCII  charac-
                                      ters  and  must  include  at  least  one
                                      non-whitespace character. ASCII  control
                                      characters  are not supported as part of
                                      dimension values.

                        Period -> (integer)
                            The granularity, in seconds, to be  used  for  the
                            metric. For metrics with regular resolution, a pe-
                            riod can be as short as one  minute  (60  seconds)
                            and  must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution
                            metrics that are collected at  intervals  of  less
                            than  one  minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30,
                            60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics
                            are  those  metrics stored by a PutMetricData call
                            that includes a StorageResolution of 1 second.

                        Stat -> (string)
                            The statistic to use for comparison to the thresh-
                            old.  It  can  be  any CloudWatch statistic or ex-
                            tended statistic. For more information about  sta-
                            tistics, see CloudWatch statistics definitions .

                        Unit -> (string)
                            If  you omit Unit then all data that was collected
                            with any unit is returned, along with  the  corre-
                            sponding  units  that were specified when the data
                            was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit,
                            the operation returns only data that was collected
                            with that unit specified. If you  specify  a  unit
                            that  does  not  match the data collected, the re-
                            sults of the operation are null.  CloudWatch  does
                            not perform unit conversions.

                     Expression -> (string)
                        This  field can contain a metric math expression to be
                        performed on the other metrics that you are retrieving
                        within this MetricDataQueries structure.

                        A  math expression can use the Id of the other metrics
                        or queries to refer to those metrics, and can also use
                        the Id of other expressions to use the result of those
                        expressions. For more information  about  metric  math
                        expressions,  see  Metric Math Syntax and Functions in
                        the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide .

                        Within each MetricDataQuery object, you  must  specify
                        either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                     Label -> (string)
                        A  human-readable label for this metric or expression.
                        This is especially useful if this is an expression, so
                        that you know what the value represents. If the metric
                        or expression is shown in a CloudWatch dashboard  wid-
                        get,  the  label is shown. If Label is omitted, Cloud-
                        Watch generates a default.

                        You can put dynamic expressions into a label, so  that
                        it  is  more  descriptive.  For  more information, see
                        Using Dynamic Labels .

                     ReturnData -> (boolean)
                        Use this only if you are using a metric  math  expres-
                        sion for the SLO. Specify true for ReturnData for only
                        the one expression result to use as the alarm. For all
                        other  metrics  and expressions in the same CreateSer-
                        viceLevelObjective operation,  specify  ReturnData  as
                        false .

                     Period -> (integer)
                        The  granularity,  in  seconds,  of  the returned data
                        points for this metric. For metrics with regular reso-
                        lution,  a  period  can  be as short as one minute (60
                        seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For  high-reso-
                        lution metrics that are collected at intervals of less
                        than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10,  30,  60,
                        or  any  multiple  of  60. High-resolution metrics are
                        those metrics stored by a PutMetricData call that  in-
                        cludes a StorageResolution of 1 second.

                        If the StartTime parameter specifies a time stamp that
                        is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the  pe-
                        riod  as  follows or no data points in that time range
                        is returned:

                        o Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago -  Use  a
                          multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).

                        o Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multi-
                          ple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).

                        o Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple
                          of 3600 seconds (1 hour).

                     AccountId -> (string)
                        The ID of the account where this metric is located. If
                        you are performing this operation in a monitoring  ac-
                        count, use this to specify which source account to re-
                        trieve this metric from.

          MetricThreshold -> (double)
              This parameter is used only when a request-based SLO tracks  the
              Latency  metric.  Specify  the threshold value that the observed
              Latency metric values are to be compared to.

          ComparisonOperator -> (string)
              The arithmetic operation to use  when  comparing  the  specified
              metric to the threshold.

       --request-based-sli-config (structure)
          If  this  SLO is a request-based SLO, this structure defines the in-
          formation about what performance metric this SLO will monitor.

          You can't specify both SliConfig and  RequestBasedSliConfig  in  the
          same operation.

          RequestBasedSliMetricConfig -> (structure)
              Use this structure to specify the metric to be used for the SLO.

              KeyAttributes -> (map)
                 If  this  SLO is related to a metric collected by Application
                 Signals, you must use this field to specify which service the
                 SLO metric is related to. To do so, you must specify at least
                 the Type , Name , and Environment attributes.

                 This is a string-to-string map. It can include the  following
                 fields.

                 o Type designates the type of object this is.

                 o ResourceType specifies the type of the resource. This field
                   is used only when the value of the Type field  is  Resource
                   or AWS::Resource .

                 o Name specifies the name of the object. This is used only if
                   the value of the Type field is Service , RemoteService , or
                   AWS::Service .

                 o Identifier  identifies  the  resource  objects  of this re-
                   source. This is used only if the value of the Type field is
                   Resource or AWS::Resource .

                 o Environment  specifies  the  location  where this object is
                   hosted, or what it belongs to.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              OperationName -> (string)
                 If the SLO is to monitor a specific operation of the service,
                 use this field to specify the name of that operation.

              MetricType -> (string)
                 If  the  SLO is to monitor either the LATENCY or AVAILABILITY
                 metric that Application Signals collects, use this  field  to
                 specify which of those metrics is used.

              TotalRequestCountMetric -> (list)
                 Use  this structure to define the metric that you want to use
                 as the "total requests" number for a request-based SLO.  This
                 result will be divided by the "good request" or "bad request"
                 value defined in MonitoredRequestCountMetric .

                 (structure)
                     Use this structure to define a metric or metric math  ex-
                     pression  that you want to use as for a service level ob-
                     jective.

                     Each MetricDataQuery in the MetricDataQueries array spec-
                     ifies  either  a metric to retrieve, or a metric math ex-
                     pression to be performed on retrieved metrics.  A  single
                     MetricDataQueries array can include as many as 20 Metric-
                     DataQuery structures in the array. The 20 structures  can
                     include  as  many as 10 structures that contain a Metric-
                     Stat parameter to retrieve a metric, and as  many  as  10
                     structures  that contain the Expression parameter to per-
                     form a math expression. Of those  Expression  structures,
                     exactly  one must have true as the value for ReturnData .
                     The result of this expression used for the SLO.

                     For more information about metric math  expressions,  see
                     CloudWatchUse metric math .

                     Within  each MetricDataQuery object, you must specify ei-
                     ther Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                     Id -> (string)
                        A short name used to tie this object to the results in
                        the  response. This Id must be unique within a Metric-
                        DataQueries array. If you are performing math  expres-
                        sions  on  this set of data, this name represents that
                        data and can serve as a variable in  the  metric  math
                        expression. The valid characters are letters, numbers,
                        and underscore. The first character must be  a  lower-
                        case letter.

                     MetricStat -> (structure)
                        A  metric  to  be  used directly for the SLO, or to be
                        used in the math expression that will be used for  the
                        SLO.

                        Within  one  MetricDataQuery  object, you must specify
                        either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                        Metric -> (structure)
                            The metric to use as the service level  indicator,
                            including  the  metric name, namespace, and dimen-
                            sions.

                            Namespace -> (string)
                               The namespace of the metric. For more  informa-
                               tion, see Namespaces .

                            MetricName -> (string)
                               The name of the metric to use.

                            Dimensions -> (list)
                               An  array  of  one or more dimensions to use to
                               define the metric that you  want  to  use.  For
                               more information, see Dimensions .

                               (structure)
                                   A  dimension  is  a name/value pair that is
                                   part of the identity of a  metric.  Because
                                   dimensions  are  part of the unique identi-
                                   fier for  a  metric,  whenever  you  add  a
                                   unique  name/value pair to one of your met-
                                   rics, you are creating a new  variation  of
                                   that  metric.  For example, many Amazon EC2
                                   metrics publish InstanceId as  a  dimension
                                   name,  and  the  actual  instance ID as the
                                   value for that dimension.

                                   You can assign up to  30  dimensions  to  a
                                   metric.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the  dimension. Dimension
                                      names must contain  only  ASCII  charac-
                                      ters,   must   include   at   least  one
                                      non-whitespace  character,  and   cannot
                                      start  with  a colon (: ). ASCII control
                                      characters are not supported as part  of
                                      dimension names.

                                   Value -> (string)
                                      The  value  of  the dimension. Dimension
                                      values must contain only  ASCII  charac-
                                      ters  and  must  include  at  least  one
                                      non-whitespace character. ASCII  control
                                      characters  are not supported as part of
                                      dimension values.

                        Period -> (integer)
                            The granularity, in seconds, to be  used  for  the
                            metric. For metrics with regular resolution, a pe-
                            riod can be as short as one  minute  (60  seconds)
                            and  must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution
                            metrics that are collected at  intervals  of  less
                            than  one  minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30,
                            60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics
                            are  those  metrics stored by a PutMetricData call
                            that includes a StorageResolution of 1 second.

                        Stat -> (string)
                            The statistic to use for comparison to the thresh-
                            old.  It  can  be  any CloudWatch statistic or ex-
                            tended statistic. For more information about  sta-
                            tistics, see CloudWatch statistics definitions .

                        Unit -> (string)
                            If  you omit Unit then all data that was collected
                            with any unit is returned, along with  the  corre-
                            sponding  units  that were specified when the data
                            was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit,
                            the operation returns only data that was collected
                            with that unit specified. If you  specify  a  unit
                            that  does  not  match the data collected, the re-
                            sults of the operation are null.  CloudWatch  does
                            not perform unit conversions.

                     Expression -> (string)
                        This  field can contain a metric math expression to be
                        performed on the other metrics that you are retrieving
                        within this MetricDataQueries structure.

                        A  math expression can use the Id of the other metrics
                        or queries to refer to those metrics, and can also use
                        the Id of other expressions to use the result of those
                        expressions. For more information  about  metric  math
                        expressions,  see  Metric Math Syntax and Functions in
                        the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide .

                        Within each MetricDataQuery object, you  must  specify
                        either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                     Label -> (string)
                        A  human-readable label for this metric or expression.
                        This is especially useful if this is an expression, so
                        that you know what the value represents. If the metric
                        or expression is shown in a CloudWatch dashboard  wid-
                        get,  the  label is shown. If Label is omitted, Cloud-
                        Watch generates a default.

                        You can put dynamic expressions into a label, so  that
                        it  is  more  descriptive.  For  more information, see
                        Using Dynamic Labels .

                     ReturnData -> (boolean)
                        Use this only if you are using a metric  math  expres-
                        sion for the SLO. Specify true for ReturnData for only
                        the one expression result to use as the alarm. For all
                        other  metrics  and expressions in the same CreateSer-
                        viceLevelObjective operation,  specify  ReturnData  as
                        false .

                     Period -> (integer)
                        The  granularity,  in  seconds,  of  the returned data
                        points for this metric. For metrics with regular reso-
                        lution,  a  period  can  be as short as one minute (60
                        seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For  high-reso-
                        lution metrics that are collected at intervals of less
                        than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10,  30,  60,
                        or  any  multiple  of  60. High-resolution metrics are
                        those metrics stored by a PutMetricData call that  in-
                        cludes a StorageResolution of 1 second.

                        If the StartTime parameter specifies a time stamp that
                        is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the  pe-
                        riod  as  follows or no data points in that time range
                        is returned:

                        o Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago -  Use  a
                          multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).

                        o Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multi-
                          ple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).

                        o Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple
                          of 3600 seconds (1 hour).

                     AccountId -> (string)
                        The ID of the account where this metric is located. If
                        you are performing this operation in a monitoring  ac-
                        count, use this to specify which source account to re-
                        trieve this metric from.

              MonitoredRequestCountMetric -> (tagged union structure)
                 Use this structure to define the metric that you want to  use
                 as  the  "good  request"  or  "bad  request"  value for a re-
                 quest-based SLO. This value observed for the  metric  defined
                 in  TotalRequestCountMetric  will  be  divided  by the number
                 found for MonitoredRequestCountMetric to determine  the  per-
                 centage of successful requests that this SLO tracks.

                 NOTE:
                     This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the follow-
                     ing top level keys can be set: GoodCountMetric, BadCount-
                     Metric.

                 GoodCountMetric -> (list)
                     If  you  want  to  count "good requests" to determine the
                     percentage of successful requests for this  request-based
                     SLO, specify the metric to use as "good requests" in this
                     structure.

                     (structure)
                        Use this structure to define a metric or  metric  math
                        expression that you want to use as for a service level
                        objective.

                        Each MetricDataQuery in  the  MetricDataQueries  array
                        specifies  either  a  metric  to retrieve, or a metric
                        math expression to be performed on retrieved  metrics.
                        A  single  MetricDataQueries array can include as many
                        as 20 MetricDataQuery structures in the array. The  20
                        structures  can  include as many as 10 structures that
                        contain a MetricStat parameter to retrieve  a  metric,
                        and  as many as 10 structures that contain the Expres-
                        sion parameter to perform a math expression. Of  those
                        Expression  structures,  exactly one must have true as
                        the value for ReturnData . The result of this  expres-
                        sion used for the SLO.

                        see CloudWatchUse metric math .

                        Within each MetricDataQuery object, you  must  specify
                        either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                        Id -> (string)
                            A  short  name  used to tie this object to the re-
                            sults in the response.  This  Id  must  be  unique
                            within  a MetricDataQueries array. If you are per-
                            forming math expressions on this set of data, this
                            name represents that data and can serve as a vari-
                            able in the  metric  math  expression.  The  valid
                            characters  are  letters, numbers, and underscore.
                            The first character must be a lowercase letter.

                        MetricStat -> (structure)
                            A metric to be used directly for the SLO, or to be
                            used  in the math expression that will be used for
                            the SLO.

                            Within one MetricDataQuery object, you must  spec-
                            ify either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                            Metric -> (structure)
                               The  metric to use as the service level indica-
                               tor, including the metric name, namespace,  and
                               dimensions.

                               Namespace -> (string)
                                   The  namespace  of the metric. For more in-
                                   formation, see Namespaces .

                               MetricName -> (string)
                                   The name of the metric to use.

                               Dimensions -> (list)
                                   An array of one or more dimensions  to  use
                                   to  define the metric that you want to use.
                                   For more information, see Dimensions .

                                   (structure)
                                      A dimension is a name/value pair that is
                                      part  of  the  identity of a metric. Be-
                                      cause dimensions are part of the  unique
                                      identifier  for  a  metric, whenever you
                                      add a unique name/value pair to  one  of
                                      your  metrics,  you  are  creating a new
                                      variation of that metric.  For  example,
                                      many  Amazon EC2 metrics publish Instan-
                                      ceId as a dimension name, and the actual
                                      instance ID as the value for that dimen-
                                      sion.

                                      You can assign up to 30 dimensions to  a
                                      metric.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the dimension. Dimension
                                          names must contain only ASCII  char-
                                          acters,  must  include  at least one
                                          non-whitespace character, and cannot
                                          start  with a colon (: ). ASCII con-
                                          trol characters are not supported as
                                          part of dimension names.

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          The  value  of the dimension. Dimen-
                                          sion values must contain only  ASCII
                                          characters and must include at least
                                          one non-whitespace character.  ASCII
                                          control characters are not supported
                                          as part of dimension values.

                            Period -> (integer)
                               The granularity, in seconds, to be used for the
                               metric.  For metrics with regular resolution, a
                               period can be as short as one minute  (60  sec-
                               onds)  and  must  be  a  multiple  of  60.  For
                               high-resolution metrics that are  collected  at
                               intervals  of  less than one minute, the period
                               can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60.
                               High-resolution   metrics   are  those  metrics
                               stored by a PutMetricData call that includes  a
                               StorageResolution of 1 second.

                            Stat -> (string)
                               The  statistic  to  use  for  comparison to the
                               threshold. It can be any  CloudWatch  statistic
                               or  extended  statistic.  For  more information
                               about  statistics,  see  CloudWatch  statistics
                               definitions .

                            Unit -> (string)
                               If  you  omit  Unit then all data that was col-
                               lected with any unit is  returned,  along  with
                               the  corresponding  units  that  were specified
                               when the data was reported  to  CloudWatch.  If
                               you  specify a unit, the operation returns only
                               data that was collected with that  unit  speci-
                               fied. If you specify a unit that does not match
                               the data collected, the results of  the  opera-
                               tion are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit
                               conversions.

                        Expression -> (string)
                            This field can contain a metric math expression to
                            be performed on the other metrics that you are re-
                            trieving within this MetricDataQueries structure.

                            A math expression can use the Id of the other met-
                            rics or queries to refer to those metrics, and can
                            also use the Id of other expressions  to  use  the
                            result  of those expressions. For more information
                            about metric math  expressions,  see  Metric  Math
                            Syntax and Functions in the Amazon CloudWatch User
                            Guide .

                            Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must spec-
                            ify either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                        Label -> (string)
                            A  human-readable label for this metric or expres-
                            sion. This is especially useful if this is an  ex-
                            pression,  so  that you know what the value repre-
                            sents. If the metric or expression is shown  in  a
                            CloudWatch  dashboard  widget, the label is shown.
                            If Label is omitted, CloudWatch  generates  a  de-
                            fault.

                            You  can  put dynamic expressions into a label, so
                            that it is more descriptive. For more information,
                            see Using Dynamic Labels .

                        ReturnData -> (boolean)
                            Use  this  only if you are using a metric math ex-
                            pression for the SLO. Specify true for  ReturnData
                            for  only  the one expression result to use as the
                            alarm. For all other metrics  and  expressions  in
                            the  same  CreateServiceLevelObjective  operation,
                            specify ReturnData as false .

                        Period -> (integer)
                            The granularity, in seconds, of the returned  data
                            points  for  this metric. For metrics with regular
                            resolution, a period can be as short as one minute
                            (60  seconds)  and  must  be a multiple of 60. For
                            high-resolution metrics that are collected at  in-
                            tervals of less than one minute, the period can be
                            1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-res-
                            olution metrics are those metrics stored by a Put-
                            MetricData call that includes a  StorageResolution
                            of 1 second.

                            If  the StartTime parameter specifies a time stamp
                            that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify
                            the  period  as  follows or no data points in that
                            time range is returned:

                            o Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use
                              a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).

                            o Start  time  between  15 and 63 days ago - Use a
                              multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).

                            o Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a mul-
                              tiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).

                        AccountId -> (string)
                            The  ID  of  the  account where this metric is lo-
                            cated. If you are performing this operation  in  a
                            monitoring  account,  use  this  to  specify which
                            source account to retrieve this metric from.

                 BadCountMetric -> (list)
                     If you want to count "bad requests" to determine the per-
                     centage  of  successful  requests  for this request-based
                     SLO, specify the metric to use as "bad requests" in  this
                     structure.

                     (structure)
                        Use  this  structure to define a metric or metric math
                        expression that you want to use as for a service level
                        objective.

                        Each  MetricDataQuery  in  the MetricDataQueries array
                        specifies either a metric to  retrieve,  or  a  metric
                        math  expression to be performed on retrieved metrics.
                        A single MetricDataQueries array can include  as  many
                        as  20 MetricDataQuery structures in the array. The 20
                        structures can include as many as 10  structures  that
                        contain  a  MetricStat parameter to retrieve a metric,
                        and as many as 10 structures that contain the  Expres-
                        sion  parameter to perform a math expression. Of those
                        Expression structures, exactly one must have  true  as
                        the  value for ReturnData . The result of this expres-
                        sion used for the SLO.

                        see CloudWatchUse metric math .

                        Within  each  MetricDataQuery object, you must specify
                        either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                        Id -> (string)
                            A short name used to tie this object  to  the  re-
                            sults  in  the  response.  This  Id must be unique
                            within a MetricDataQueries array. If you are  per-
                            forming math expressions on this set of data, this
                            name represents that data and can serve as a vari-
                            able  in  the  metric  math  expression. The valid
                            characters are letters, numbers,  and  underscore.
                            The first character must be a lowercase letter.

                        MetricStat -> (structure)
                            A metric to be used directly for the SLO, or to be
                            used in the math expression that will be used  for
                            the SLO.

                            Within  one MetricDataQuery object, you must spec-
                            ify either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                            Metric -> (structure)
                               The metric to use as the service level  indica-
                               tor,  including the metric name, namespace, and
                               dimensions.

                               Namespace -> (string)
                                   The namespace of the metric. For  more  in-
                                   formation, see Namespaces .

                               MetricName -> (string)
                                   The name of the metric to use.

                               Dimensions -> (list)
                                   An  array  of one or more dimensions to use
                                   to define the metric that you want to  use.
                                   For more information, see Dimensions .

                                   (structure)
                                      A dimension is a name/value pair that is
                                      part of the identity of  a  metric.  Be-
                                      cause  dimensions are part of the unique
                                      identifier for a  metric,  whenever  you
                                      add  a  unique name/value pair to one of
                                      your metrics, you  are  creating  a  new
                                      variation  of  that metric. For example,
                                      many Amazon EC2 metrics publish  Instan-
                                      ceId as a dimension name, and the actual
                                      instance ID as the value for that dimen-
                                      sion.

                                      You  can assign up to 30 dimensions to a
                                      metric.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the dimension. Dimension
                                          names  must contain only ASCII char-
                                          acters, must include  at  least  one
                                          non-whitespace character, and cannot
                                          start with a colon (: ). ASCII  con-
                                          trol characters are not supported as
                                          part of dimension names.

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          The value of the  dimension.  Dimen-
                                          sion  values must contain only ASCII
                                          characters and must include at least
                                          one  non-whitespace character. ASCII
                                          control characters are not supported
                                          as part of dimension values.

                            Period -> (integer)
                               The granularity, in seconds, to be used for the
                               metric. For metrics with regular resolution,  a
                               period  can  be as short as one minute (60 sec-
                               onds)  and  must  be  a  multiple  of  60.  For
                               high-resolution  metrics  that are collected at
                               intervals of less than one minute,  the  period
                               can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60.
                               High-resolution  metrics  are   those   metrics
                               stored  by a PutMetricData call that includes a
                               StorageResolution of 1 second.

                            Stat -> (string)
                               The statistic to  use  for  comparison  to  the
                               threshold.  It  can be any CloudWatch statistic
                               or extended  statistic.  For  more  information
                               about  statistics,  see  CloudWatch  statistics
                               definitions .

                            Unit -> (string)
                               If you omit Unit then all data  that  was  col-
                               lected  with  any  unit is returned, along with
                               the corresponding  units  that  were  specified
                               when  the  data  was reported to CloudWatch. If
                               you specify a unit, the operation returns  only
                               data  that  was collected with that unit speci-
                               fied. If you specify a unit that does not match
                               the  data  collected, the results of the opera-
                               tion are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit
                               conversions.

                        Expression -> (string)
                            This field can contain a metric math expression to
                            be performed on the other metrics that you are re-
                            trieving within this MetricDataQueries structure.

                            A math expression can use the Id of the other met-
                            rics or queries to refer to those metrics, and can
                            also  use  the  Id of other expressions to use the
                            result of those expressions. For more  information
                            about  metric  math  expressions,  see Metric Math
                            Syntax and Functions in the Amazon CloudWatch User
                            Guide .

                            Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must spec-
                            ify either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                        Label -> (string)
                            A human-readable label for this metric or  expres-
                            sion.  This is especially useful if this is an ex-
                            pression, so that you know what the  value  repre-
                            sents.  If  the metric or expression is shown in a
                            CloudWatch dashboard widget, the label  is  shown.
                            If  Label  is  omitted, CloudWatch generates a de-
                            fault.

                            You can put dynamic expressions into a  label,  so
                            that it is more descriptive. For more information,
                            see Using Dynamic Labels .

                        ReturnData -> (boolean)
                            Use this only if you are using a metric  math  ex-
                            pression  for the SLO. Specify true for ReturnData
                            for only the one expression result to use  as  the
                            alarm.  For  all  other metrics and expressions in
                            the  same  CreateServiceLevelObjective  operation,
                            specify ReturnData as false .

                        Period -> (integer)
                            The  granularity, in seconds, of the returned data
                            points for this metric. For metrics  with  regular
                            resolution, a period can be as short as one minute
                            (60 seconds) and must be a  multiple  of  60.  For
                            high-resolution  metrics that are collected at in-
                            tervals of less than one minute, the period can be
                            1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-res-
                            olution metrics are those metrics stored by a Put-
                            MetricData  call that includes a StorageResolution
                            of 1 second.

                            If the StartTime parameter specifies a time  stamp
                            that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify
                            the period as follows or no data  points  in  that
                            time range is returned:

                            o Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use
                              a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).

                            o Start time between 15 and 63 days ago  -  Use  a
                              multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).

                            o Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a mul-
                              tiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).

                        AccountId -> (string)
                            The ID of the account where  this  metric  is  lo-
                            cated.  If  you are performing this operation in a
                            monitoring account,  use  this  to  specify  which
                            source account to retrieve this metric from.

          MetricThreshold -> (double)
              The  value that the SLI metric is compared to. This parameter is
              required if this SLO is tracking the Latency metric.

          ComparisonOperator -> (string)
              The arithmetic operation to use  when  comparing  the  specified
              metric  to the threshold. This parameter is required if this SLO
              is tracking the Latency metric.

       --goal (structure)
          A structure that contains the attributes that determine the goal  of
          the  SLO.  This  includes the time period for evaluation and the at-
          tainment threshold.

          Interval -> (tagged union structure)
              The time period used to evaluate the SLO. It  can  be  either  a
              calendar interval or rolling interval.

              If  you  omit  this  parameter,  a rolling interval of 7 days is
              used.

              NOTE:
                 This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of  the  following
                 top level keys can be set: RollingInterval, CalendarInterval.

              RollingInterval -> (structure)
                 If  the  interval  is a rolling interval, this structure con-
                 tains the interval specifications.

                 DurationUnit -> (string)
                     Specifies the rolling interval unit.

                 Duration -> (integer)
                     Specifies the duration of each rolling interval. For  ex-
                     ample,  if  Duration  is 7 and DurationUnit is DAY , each
                     rolling interval is seven days.

              CalendarInterval -> (structure)
                 If the interval is a calendar interval, this  structure  con-
                 tains the interval specifications.

                 StartTime -> (timestamp)
                     The  date  and  time  when you want the first interval to
                     start. Be sure to choose a time that configures  the  in-
                     tervals  the  way that you want. For example, if you want
                     weekly intervals starting on Mondays at 6 a.m.,  be  sure
                     to specify a start time that is a Monday at 6 a.m.

                     When  used in a raw HTTP Query API, it is formatted as be
                     epoch time in seconds. For example: 1698778057

                     As soon as one calendar interval ends, another  automati-
                     cally begins.

                 DurationUnit -> (string)
                     Specifies the calendar interval unit.

                 Duration -> (integer)
                     Specifies the duration of each calendar interval. For ex-
                     ample, if Duration is 1 and DurationUnit is MONTH ,  each
                     interval is one month, aligned with the calendar.

          AttainmentGoal -> (double)
              The threshold that determines if the goal is being met.

              If  this  is a period-based SLO, the attainment goal is the per-
              centage of good periods that meet the threshold requirements  to
              the  total  periods within the interval. For example, an attain-
              ment goal of 99.9% means that within your interval, you are tar-
              geting 99.9% of the periods to be in healthy state.

              If  this is a request-based SLO, the attainment goal is the per-
              centage of requests that must be successful to meet the  attain-
              ment goal.

              If  you  omit this parameter, 99 is used to represent 99% as the
              attainment goal.

          WarningThreshold -> (double)
              The percentage of remaining budget over total  budget  that  you
              want  to  get  warnings for. If you omit this parameter, the de-
              fault of 50.0 is used.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Interval={RollingInterval={DurationUnit=string,Duration=integer},CalendarInterval={StartTime=timestamp,DurationUnit=string,Duration=integer}},AttainmentGoal=double,WarningThreshold=double

       JSON Syntax:

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                 KeyAttributes -> (map)
                     This  is a string-to-string map that contains information
                     about the type of object that this SLO is related to.  It
                     can include the following fields.

                     o Type designates the type of object that this SLO is re-
                       lated to.

                     o ResourceType specifies the type of the  resource.  This
                       field  is used only when the value of the Type field is
                       Resource or AWS::Resource .

                     o Name specifies the name of the  object.  This  is  used
                       only  if  the  value of the Type field is Service , Re-

                     o Environment specifies the location where this object is
                       hosted, or what it belongs to.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 OperationName -> (string)
                     If  the SLO monitors a specific operation of the service,
                     this field displays that operation name.

                 MetricType -> (string)
                     If the SLO monitors either the  LATENCY  or  AVAILABILITY
                     metric that Application Signals collects, this field dis-
                     plays which of those metrics is used.

                 MetricDataQueries -> (list)
                     If this SLO monitors a CloudWatch metric or the result of
                     a  CloudWatch  metric math expression, this structure in-
                     cludes the information about that metric or expression.

                     (structure)
                        Use this structure to define a metric or  metric  math
                        expression that you want to use as for a service level
                        objective.

                        Each MetricDataQuery in  the  MetricDataQueries  array
                        specifies  either  a  metric  to retrieve, or a metric
                        math expression to be performed on retrieved  metrics.
                        A  single  MetricDataQueries array can include as many
                        as 20 MetricDataQuery structures in the array. The  20
                        structures  can  include as many as 10 structures that
                        contain a MetricStat parameter to retrieve  a  metric,
                        and  as many as 10 structures that contain the Expres-
                        sion parameter to perform a math expression. Of  those
                        Expression  structures,  exactly one must have true as
                        the value for ReturnData . The result of this  expres-
                        sion used for the SLO.

                        For  more  information  about metric math expressions,
                        see CloudWatchUse metric math .

                        Within each MetricDataQuery object, you  must  specify
                        either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                        Id -> (string)
                            A  short  name  used to tie this object to the re-
                            sults in the response.  This  Id  must  be  unique
                            within  a MetricDataQueries array. If you are per-
                            forming math expressions on this set of data, this
                            name represents that data and can serve as a vari-
                            able in the  metric  math  expression.  The  valid
                            characters  are  letters, numbers, and underscore.
                            The first character must be a lowercase letter.

                        MetricStat -> (structure)
                            A metric to be used directly for the SLO, or to be
                            used  in the math expression that will be used for
                            the SLO.

                            Within one MetricDataQuery object, you must  spec-
                            ify either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                            Metric -> (structure)
                               The  metric to use as the service level indica-
                               tor, including the metric name, namespace,  and
                               dimensions.

                               Namespace -> (string)
                                   The  namespace  of the metric. For more in-
                                   formation, see Namespaces .

                               MetricName -> (string)
                                   The name of the metric to use.

                               Dimensions -> (list)
                                   An array of one or more dimensions  to  use
                                   to  define the metric that you want to use.
                                   For more information, see Dimensions .

                                   (structure)
                                      A dimension is a name/value pair that is
                                      part  of  the  identity of a metric. Be-
                                      cause dimensions are part of the  unique
                                      identifier  for  a  metric, whenever you
                                      add a unique name/value pair to  one  of
                                      your  metrics,  you  are  creating a new
                                      variation of that metric.  For  example,
                                      many  Amazon EC2 metrics publish Instan-
                                      ceId as a dimension name, and the actual
                                      instance ID as the value for that dimen-
                                      sion.

                                      You can assign up to 30 dimensions to  a
                                      metric.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the dimension. Dimension
                                          names must contain only ASCII  char-
                                          acters,  must  include  at least one
                                          non-whitespace character, and cannot
                                          start  with a colon (: ). ASCII con-
                                          trol characters are not supported as
                                          part of dimension names.

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          The  value  of the dimension. Dimen-
                                          sion values must contain only  ASCII
                                          characters and must include at least
                                          one non-whitespace character.  ASCII
                                          control characters are not supported
                                          as part of dimension values.

                            Period -> (integer)
                               The granularity, in seconds, to be used for the
                               metric.  For metrics with regular resolution, a
                               period can be as short as one minute  (60  sec-
                               onds)  and  must  be  a  multiple  of  60.  For
                               high-resolution metrics that are  collected  at
                               intervals  of  less than one minute, the period
                               can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60.
                               High-resolution   metrics   are  those  metrics
                               stored by a PutMetricData call that includes  a
                               StorageResolution of 1 second.

                            Stat -> (string)
                               The  statistic  to  use  for  comparison to the
                               threshold. It can be any  CloudWatch  statistic
                               or  extended  statistic.  For  more information
                               about  statistics,  see  CloudWatch  statistics
                               definitions .

                            Unit -> (string)
                               If  you  omit  Unit then all data that was col-
                               lected with any unit is  returned,  along  with
                               the  corresponding  units  that  were specified
                               when the data was reported  to  CloudWatch.  If
                               you  specify a unit, the operation returns only
                               data that was collected with that  unit  speci-
                               fied. If you specify a unit that does not match
                               the data collected, the results of  the  opera-
                               tion are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit
                               conversions.

                        Expression -> (string)
                            This field can contain a metric math expression to
                            be performed on the other metrics that you are re-
                            trieving within this MetricDataQueries structure.

                            A math expression can use the Id of the other met-
                            rics or queries to refer to those metrics, and can
                            also use the Id of other expressions  to  use  the
                            result  of those expressions. For more information
                            about metric math  expressions,  see  Metric  Math
                            Syntax and Functions in the Amazon CloudWatch User
                            Guide .

                            Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must spec-
                            ify either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                        Label -> (string)
                            A  human-readable label for this metric or expres-
                            sion. This is especially useful if this is an  ex-
                            pression,  so  that you know what the value repre-
                            sents. If the metric or expression is shown  in  a
                            CloudWatch  dashboard  widget, the label is shown.
                            If Label is omitted, CloudWatch  generates  a  de-
                            fault.

                            You  can  put dynamic expressions into a label, so
                            that it is more descriptive. For more information,
                            see Using Dynamic Labels .

                        ReturnData -> (boolean)
                            Use  this  only if you are using a metric math ex-
                            pression for the SLO. Specify true for  ReturnData
                            for  only  the one expression result to use as the
                            alarm. For all other metrics  and  expressions  in
                            the  same  CreateServiceLevelObjective  operation,
                            specify ReturnData as false .

                        Period -> (integer)
                            The granularity, in seconds, of the returned  data
                            points  for  this metric. For metrics with regular
                            resolution, a period can be as short as one minute
                            (60  seconds)  and  must  be a multiple of 60. For
                            high-resolution metrics that are collected at  in-
                            tervals of less than one minute, the period can be
                            1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-res-
                            olution metrics are those metrics stored by a Put-
                            MetricData call that includes a  StorageResolution
                            of 1 second.

                            If  the StartTime parameter specifies a time stamp
                            that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify
                            the  period  as  follows or no data points in that
                            time range is returned:

                            o Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use
                              a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).

                            o Start  time  between  15 and 63 days ago - Use a
                              multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).

                            o Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a mul-
                              tiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).

                        AccountId -> (string)
                            The  ID  of  the  account where this metric is lo-
                            cated. If you are performing this operation  in  a
                            monitoring  account,  use  this  to  specify which
                            source account to retrieve this metric from.

              MetricThreshold -> (double)
                 The value that the SLI metric is compared to.

              ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                 The arithmetic operation used when  comparing  the  specified
                 metric to the threshold.

          RequestBasedSli -> (structure)
              A  structure containing information about the performance metric
              that this SLO monitors, if this is a request-based SLO.

              RequestBasedSliMetric -> (structure)
                 A structure that contains information about the  metric  that
                 the SLO monitors.

                 KeyAttributes -> (map)
                     This  is a string-to-string map that contains information
                     about the type of object that this SLO is related to.  It
                     can include the following fields.

                     o Type designates the type of object that this SLO is re-
                       lated to.

                     o ResourceType specifies the type of the  resource.  This
                       field  is used only when the value of the Type field is
                       Resource or AWS::Resource .

                     o Name specifies the name of the  object.  This  is  used
                       only  if  the  value of the Type field is Service , Re-
                       moteService , or AWS::Service .

                     o Identifier identifies the resource objects of this  re-
                       source.  This  is  used  only  if the value of the Type
                       field is Resource or AWS::Resource .

                     o Environment specifies the location where this object is
                       hosted, or what it belongs to.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 OperationName -> (string)
                     If  the SLO monitors a specific operation of the service,
                     this field displays that operation name.

                 MetricType -> (string)
                     If the SLO monitors either the  LATENCY  or  AVAILABILITY
                     metric that Application Signals collects, this field dis-
                     plays which of those metrics is used.

                 TotalRequestCountMetric -> (list)
                     This structure defines the metric that  is  used  as  the
                     "total requests" number for a request-based SLO. The num-
                     ber observed for this metric is divided by the number  of
                     "good  requests"  or  "bad requests" that is observed for
                     the metric defined in MonitoredRequestCountMetric .

                     (structure)
                        Use this structure to define a metric or  metric  math
                        expression that you want to use as for a service level
                        objective.

                        Each MetricDataQuery in  the  MetricDataQueries  array
                        specifies  either  a  metric  to retrieve, or a metric
                        math expression to be performed on retrieved  metrics.
                        A  single  MetricDataQueries array can include as many
                        as 20 MetricDataQuery structures in the array. The  20
                        structures  can  include as many as 10 structures that
                        contain a MetricStat parameter to retrieve  a  metric,
                        and  as many as 10 structures that contain the Expres-
                        sion parameter to perform a math expression. Of  those
                        Expression  structures,  exactly one must have true as
                        the value for ReturnData . The result of this  expres-
                        sion used for the SLO.

                        For  more  information  about metric math expressions,
                        see CloudWatchUse metric math .

                        Within each MetricDataQuery object, you  must  specify
                        either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                        Id -> (string)
                            A  short  name  used to tie this object to the re-
                            sults in the response.  This  Id  must  be  unique
                            within  a MetricDataQueries array. If you are per-
                            forming math expressions on this set of data, this
                            name represents that data and can serve as a vari-
                            able in the  metric  math  expression.  The  valid
                            characters  are  letters, numbers, and underscore.
                            The first character must be a lowercase letter.

                        MetricStat -> (structure)
                            A metric to be used directly for the SLO, or to be
                            used  in the math expression that will be used for
                            the SLO.

                            Within one MetricDataQuery object, you must  spec-
                            ify either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                            Metric -> (structure)
                               The  metric to use as the service level indica-
                               tor, including the metric name, namespace,  and
                               dimensions.

                               Namespace -> (string)
                                   The  namespace  of the metric. For more in-
                                   formation, see Namespaces .

                               MetricName -> (string)
                                   The name of the metric to use.

                               Dimensions -> (list)
                                   An array of one or more dimensions  to  use
                                   to  define the metric that you want to use.
                                   For more information, see Dimensions .

                                   (structure)
                                      A dimension is a name/value pair that is
                                      part  of  the  identity of a metric. Be-
                                      cause dimensions are part of the  unique
                                      identifier  for  a  metric, whenever you
                                      add a unique name/value pair to  one  of
                                      your  metrics,  you  are  creating a new
                                      variation of that metric.  For  example,
                                      many  Amazon EC2 metrics publish Instan-
                                      ceId as a dimension name, and the actual
                                      instance ID as the value for that dimen-
                                      sion.

                                      You can assign up to 30 dimensions to  a
                                      metric.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the dimension. Dimension
                                          names must contain only ASCII  char-
                                          acters,  must  include  at least one
                                          non-whitespace character, and cannot
                                          start  with a colon (: ). ASCII con-
                                          trol characters are not supported as
                                          part of dimension names.

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          The  value  of the dimension. Dimen-
                                          sion values must contain only  ASCII
                                          characters and must include at least
                                          one non-whitespace character.  ASCII
                                          control characters are not supported
                                          as part of dimension values.

                            Period -> (integer)
                               The granularity, in seconds, to be used for the
                               metric.  For metrics with regular resolution, a
                               period can be as short as one minute  (60  sec-
                               onds)  and  must  be  a  multiple  of  60.  For
                               high-resolution metrics that are  collected  at
                               intervals  of  less than one minute, the period
                               can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60.
                               High-resolution   metrics   are  those  metrics
                               stored by a PutMetricData call that includes  a
                               StorageResolution of 1 second.

                            Stat -> (string)
                               The  statistic  to  use  for  comparison to the
                               threshold. It can be any  CloudWatch  statistic
                               or  extended  statistic.  For  more information
                               about  statistics,  see  CloudWatch  statistics
                               definitions .

                            Unit -> (string)
                               If  you  omit  Unit then all data that was col-
                               lected with any unit is  returned,  along  with
                               the  corresponding  units  that  were specified
                               when the data was reported  to  CloudWatch.  If
                               you  specify a unit, the operation returns only
                               data that was collected with that  unit  speci-
                               fied. If you specify a unit that does not match
                               the data collected, the results of  the  opera-
                               tion are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit
                               conversions.

                        Expression -> (string)
                            This field can contain a metric math expression to
                            be performed on the other metrics that you are re-
                            trieving within this MetricDataQueries structure.

                            A math expression can use the Id of the other met-
                            rics or queries to refer to those metrics, and can
                            also use the Id of other expressions  to  use  the
                            result  of those expressions. For more information
                            about metric math  expressions,  see  Metric  Math
                            Syntax and Functions in the Amazon CloudWatch User
                            Guide .

                            Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must spec-
                            ify either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                        Label -> (string)
                            A  human-readable label for this metric or expres-
                            sion. This is especially useful if this is an  ex-
                            pression,  so  that you know what the value repre-
                            sents. If the metric or expression is shown  in  a
                            CloudWatch  dashboard  widget, the label is shown.
                            If Label is omitted, CloudWatch  generates  a  de-
                            fault.

                            You  can  put dynamic expressions into a label, so
                            that it is more descriptive. For more information,
                            see Using Dynamic Labels .

                        ReturnData -> (boolean)
                            Use  this  only if you are using a metric math ex-
                            pression for the SLO. Specify true for  ReturnData
                            for  only  the one expression result to use as the
                            alarm. For all other metrics  and  expressions  in
                            the  same  CreateServiceLevelObjective  operation,
                            specify ReturnData as false .

                        Period -> (integer)
                            The granularity, in seconds, of the returned  data
                            points  for  this metric. For metrics with regular
                            resolution, a period can be as short as one minute
                            (60  seconds)  and  must  be a multiple of 60. For
                            high-resolution metrics that are collected at  in-
                            tervals of less than one minute, the period can be
                            1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-res-
                            olution metrics are those metrics stored by a Put-
                            MetricData call that includes a  StorageResolution
                            of 1 second.

                            If  the StartTime parameter specifies a time stamp
                            that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify
                            the  period  as  follows or no data points in that
                            time range is returned:

                            o Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use
                              a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).

                            o Start  time  between  15 and 63 days ago - Use a
                              multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).

                            o Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a mul-
                              tiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).

                        AccountId -> (string)
                            The  ID  of  the  account where this metric is lo-
                            cated. If you are performing this operation  in  a
                            monitoring  account,  use  this  to  specify which
                            source account to retrieve this metric from.

                 MonitoredRequestCountMetric -> (tagged union structure)
                     This structure defines the metric that  is  used  as  the
                     "good request" or "bad request" value for a request-based
                     SLO. This value observed for the metric defined in Total-
                     RequestCountMetric  is  divided  by  the number found for
                     MonitoredRequestCountMetric to determine  the  percentage
                     of successful requests that this SLO tracks.

                     NOTE:
                        This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the fol-
                        lowing top level keys  can  be  set:  GoodCountMetric,
                        BadCountMetric.

                     GoodCountMetric -> (list)
                        If  you want to count "good requests" to determine the
                        percentage  of  successful  requests  for   this   re-
                        quest-based  SLO,  specify  the metric to use as "good
                        requests" in this structure.

                        (structure)
                            Use this structure to define a  metric  or  metric
                            math expression that you want to use as for a ser-
                            vice level objective.

                            Each MetricDataQuery in the MetricDataQueries  ar-
                            ray  specifies  either  a metric to retrieve, or a
                            metric math expression  to  be  performed  on  re-
                            trieved  metrics. A single MetricDataQueries array
                            can include as many as 20  MetricDataQuery  struc-
                            tures  in the array. The 20 structures can include
                            as many as 10 structures that contain a MetricStat
                            parameter  to retrieve a metric, and as many as 10
                            structures that contain the  Expression  parameter
                            to  perform a math expression. Of those Expression
                            structures, exactly one  must  have  true  as  the
                            value  for ReturnData . The result of this expres-
                            sion used for the SLO.

                            sions, see CloudWatchUse metric math .

                            Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must spec-
                            ify either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                            Id -> (string)
                               A short name used to tie this object to the re-
                               sults  in  the response. This Id must be unique
                               within a MetricDataQueries array.  If  you  are
                               performing  math  expressions  on  this  set of
                               data, this name represents that  data  and  can
                               serve  as a variable in the metric math expres-
                               sion. The valid characters  are  letters,  num-
                               bers,  and underscore. The first character must
                               be a lowercase letter.

                            MetricStat -> (structure)
                               A metric to be used directly for the SLO, or to
                               be  used  in  the  math expression that will be
                               used for the SLO.

                               Within one  MetricDataQuery  object,  you  must
                               specify either Expression or MetricStat but not
                               both.

                               Metric -> (structure)
                                   The metric to use as the service level  in-
                                   dicator,  including  the metric name, name-
                                   space, and dimensions.

                                   Namespace -> (string)
                                      The namespace of the  metric.  For  more
                                      information, see Namespaces .

                                   MetricName -> (string)
                                      The name of the metric to use.

                                   Dimensions -> (list)
                                      An  array  of  one or more dimensions to
                                      use to define the metric that  you  want
                                      to   use.   For  more  information,  see
                                      Dimensions .

                                      (structure)
                                          A dimension  is  a  name/value  pair
                                          that  is  part  of the identity of a
                                          metric. Because dimensions are  part
                                          of  the unique identifier for a met-
                                          ric,  whenever  you  add  a   unique
                                          name/value  pair to one of your met-
                                          rics, you are creating a new  varia-
                                          tion  of  that  metric. For example,
                                          many Amazon EC2 metrics publish  In-
                                          stanceId  as  a  dimension name, and
                                          the actual instance ID as the  value
                                          for that dimension.

                                          You  can  assign up to 30 dimensions
                                          to a metric.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the dimension. Dimen-
                                             sion   names  must  contain  only
                                             ASCII characters, must include at
                                             least  one non-whitespace charac-
                                             ter,  and  cannot  start  with  a
                                             colon (: ). ASCII control charac-
                                             ters are not supported as part of
                                             dimension names.

                                          Value -> (string)
                                             The  value  of the dimension. Di-
                                             mension values must contain  only
                                             ASCII characters and must include
                                             at least one non-whitespace char-
                                             acter.  ASCII  control characters
                                             are not supported as part of  di-
                                             mension values.

                               Period -> (integer)
                                   The granularity, in seconds, to be used for
                                   the metric. For metrics with regular  reso-
                                   lution,  a  period  can  be as short as one
                                   minute (60 seconds) and must be a  multiple
                                   of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are
                                   collected at intervals  of  less  than  one
                                   minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60,
                                   or any multiple of 60. High-resolution met-
                                   rics  are those metrics stored by a PutMet-
                                   ricData call that includes a StorageResolu-
                                   tion of 1 second.

                               Stat -> (string)
                                   The  statistic to use for comparison to the
                                   threshold. It can be any CloudWatch statis-
                                   tic  or extended statistic. For more infor-
                                   mation  about  statistics,  see  CloudWatch
                                   statistics definitions .

                               Unit -> (string)
                                   If  you  omit  Unit  then all data that was
                                   collected with any unit is returned,  along
                                   with  the  corresponding  units  that  were
                                   specified when the  data  was  reported  to
                                   CloudWatch.  If you specify a unit, the op-
                                   eration returns only  data  that  was  col-
                                   lected  with  that  unit  specified. If you
                                   specify a unit that does not match the data
                                   collected, the results of the operation are
                                   null. CloudWatch does not perform unit con-
                                   versions.

                            Expression -> (string)
                               This field can contain a metric math expression
                               to be performed on the other metrics  that  you
                               are  retrieving  within  this MetricDataQueries
                               structure.

                               A math expression can use the Id of  the  other
                               metrics  or  queries to refer to those metrics,
                               and can also use the Id of other expressions to
                               use  the  result of those expressions. For more
                               information about metric math expressions,  see
                               Metric  Math Syntax and Functions in the Amazon
                               CloudWatch User Guide .

                               Within each MetricDataQuery  object,  you  must
                               specify either Expression or MetricStat but not
                               both.

                            Label -> (string)
                               A human-readable label for this metric  or  ex-
                               pression.  This is especially useful if this is
                               an expression, so that you know what the  value
                               represents.  If  the  metric  or  expression is
                               shown in a CloudWatch dashboard widget, the la-
                               bel  is  shown. If Label is omitted, CloudWatch
                               generates a default.

                               You can put dynamic expressions into  a  label,
                               so that it is more descriptive. For more infor-
                               mation, see Using Dynamic Labels .

                            ReturnData -> (boolean)
                               Use this only if you are using  a  metric  math
                               expression  for  the  SLO. Specify true for Re-
                               turnData for only the one expression result  to
                               use as the alarm. For all other metrics and ex-
                               pressions in the same  CreateServiceLevelObjec-
                               tive operation, specify ReturnData as false .

                            Period -> (integer)
                               The  granularity,  in  seconds, of the returned
                               data points for this metric. For  metrics  with
                               regular resolution, a period can be as short as
                               one minute (60 seconds) and must be a  multiple
                               of  60.  For  high-resolution  metrics that are
                               collected at intervals of less than one minute,
                               the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any mul-
                               tiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are  those
                               metrics stored by a PutMetricData call that in-
                               cludes a StorageResolution of 1 second.

                               If the StartTime  parameter  specifies  a  time
                               stamp  that  is  greater  than 3 hours ago, you
                               must specify the period as follows or  no  data
                               points in that time range is returned:

                               o Start  time between 3 hours and 15 days ago -
                                 Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).

                               o Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a
                                 multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).

                               o Start  time  greater than 63 days ago - Use a
                                 multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).

                            AccountId -> (string)
                               The ID of the account where this metric is  lo-
                               cated.  If you are performing this operation in
                               a monitoring account, use this to specify which
                               source account to retrieve this metric from.

                     BadCountMetric -> (list)
                        If  you  want to count "bad requests" to determine the
                        percentage  of  successful  requests  for   this   re-
                        quest-based SLO, specify the metric to use as "bad re-
                        quests" in this structure.

                        (structure)
                            Use this structure to define a  metric  or  metric
                            math expression that you want to use as for a ser-
                            vice level objective.

                            Each MetricDataQuery in the MetricDataQueries  ar-
                            ray  specifies  either  a metric to retrieve, or a
                            metric math expression  to  be  performed  on  re-
                            trieved  metrics. A single MetricDataQueries array
                            can include as many as 20  MetricDataQuery  struc-
                            tures  in the array. The 20 structures can include
                            as many as 10 structures that contain a MetricStat
                            parameter  to retrieve a metric, and as many as 10
                            structures that contain the  Expression  parameter
                            to  perform a math expression. Of those Expression
                            structures, exactly one  must  have  true  as  the
                            value  for ReturnData . The result of this expres-
                            sion used for the SLO.

                            sions, see CloudWatchUse metric math .

                            Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must spec-
                            ify either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                            Id -> (string)
                               A short name used to tie this object to the re-
                               sults  in  the response. This Id must be unique
                               within a MetricDataQueries array.  If  you  are
                               performing  math  expressions  on  this  set of
                               data, this name represents that  data  and  can
                               serve  as a variable in the metric math expres-
                               sion. The valid characters  are  letters,  num-
                               bers,  and underscore. The first character must
                               be a lowercase letter.

                            MetricStat -> (structure)
                               A metric to be used directly for the SLO, or to
                               be  used  in  the  math expression that will be
                               used for the SLO.

                               Within one  MetricDataQuery  object,  you  must
                               specify either Expression or MetricStat but not
                               both.

                               Metric -> (structure)
                                   The metric to use as the service level  in-
                                   dicator,  including  the metric name, name-
                                   space, and dimensions.

                                   Namespace -> (string)
                                      The namespace of the  metric.  For  more
                                      information, see Namespaces .

                                   MetricName -> (string)
                                      The name of the metric to use.

                                   Dimensions -> (list)
                                      An  array  of  one or more dimensions to
                                      use to define the metric that  you  want
                                      to   use.   For  more  information,  see
                                      Dimensions .

                                      (structure)
                                          A dimension  is  a  name/value  pair
                                          that  is  part  of the identity of a
                                          metric. Because dimensions are  part
                                          of  the unique identifier for a met-
                                          ric,  whenever  you  add  a   unique
                                          name/value  pair to one of your met-
                                          rics, you are creating a new  varia-
                                          tion  of  that  metric. For example,
                                          many Amazon EC2 metrics publish  In-
                                          stanceId  as  a  dimension name, and
                                          the actual instance ID as the  value
                                          for that dimension.

                                          You  can  assign up to 30 dimensions
                                          to a metric.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the dimension. Dimen-
                                             sion   names  must  contain  only
                                             ASCII characters, must include at
                                             least  one non-whitespace charac-
                                             ter,  and  cannot  start  with  a
                                             colon (: ). ASCII control charac-
                                             ters are not supported as part of
                                             dimension names.

                                          Value -> (string)
                                             The  value  of the dimension. Di-
                                             mension values must contain  only
                                             ASCII characters and must include
                                             at least one non-whitespace char-
                                             acter.  ASCII  control characters
                                             are not supported as part of  di-
                                             mension values.

                               Period -> (integer)
                                   The granularity, in seconds, to be used for
                                   the metric. For metrics with regular  reso-
                                   lution,  a  period  can  be as short as one
                                   minute (60 seconds) and must be a  multiple
                                   of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are
                                   collected at intervals  of  less  than  one
                                   minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60,
                                   or any multiple of 60. High-resolution met-
                                   rics  are those metrics stored by a PutMet-
                                   ricData call that includes a StorageResolu-
                                   tion of 1 second.

                               Stat -> (string)
                                   The  statistic to use for comparison to the
                                   threshold. It can be any CloudWatch statis-
                                   tic  or extended statistic. For more infor-
                                   mation  about  statistics,  see  CloudWatch
                                   statistics definitions .

                               Unit -> (string)
                                   If  you  omit  Unit  then all data that was
                                   collected with any unit is returned,  along
                                   with  the  corresponding  units  that  were
                                   specified when the  data  was  reported  to
                                   CloudWatch.  If you specify a unit, the op-
                                   eration returns only  data  that  was  col-
                                   lected  with  that  unit  specified. If you
                                   specify a unit that does not match the data
                                   collected, the results of the operation are
                                   null. CloudWatch does not perform unit con-
                                   versions.

                            Expression -> (string)
                               This field can contain a metric math expression
                               to be performed on the other metrics  that  you
                               are  retrieving  within  this MetricDataQueries
                               structure.

                               A math expression can use the Id of  the  other
                               metrics  or  queries to refer to those metrics,
                               and can also use the Id of other expressions to
                               use  the  result of those expressions. For more
                               information about metric math expressions,  see
                               Metric  Math Syntax and Functions in the Amazon
                               CloudWatch User Guide .

                               Within each MetricDataQuery  object,  you  must
                               specify either Expression or MetricStat but not
                               both.

                            Label -> (string)
                               A human-readable label for this metric  or  ex-
                               pression.  This is especially useful if this is
                               an expression, so that you know what the  value
                               represents.  If  the  metric  or  expression is
                               shown in a CloudWatch dashboard widget, the la-
                               bel  is  shown. If Label is omitted, CloudWatch
                               generates a default.

                               You can put dynamic expressions into  a  label,
                               so that it is more descriptive. For more infor-
                               mation, see Using Dynamic Labels .

                            ReturnData -> (boolean)
                               Use this only if you are using  a  metric  math
                               expression  for  the  SLO. Specify true for Re-
                               turnData for only the one expression result  to
                               use as the alarm. For all other metrics and ex-
                               pressions in the same  CreateServiceLevelObjec-
                               tive operation, specify ReturnData as false .

                            Period -> (integer)
                               The  granularity,  in  seconds, of the returned
                               data points for this metric. For  metrics  with
                               regular resolution, a period can be as short as
                               one minute (60 seconds) and must be a  multiple
                               of  60.  For  high-resolution  metrics that are
                               collected at intervals of less than one minute,
                               the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any mul-
                               tiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are  those
                               metrics stored by a PutMetricData call that in-
                               cludes a StorageResolution of 1 second.

                               If the StartTime  parameter  specifies  a  time
                               stamp  that  is  greater  than 3 hours ago, you
                               must specify the period as follows or  no  data
                               points in that time range is returned:

                               o Start  time between 3 hours and 15 days ago -
                                 Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).

                               o Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a
                                 multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).

                               o Start  time  greater than 63 days ago - Use a
                                 multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).

                            AccountId -> (string)
                               The ID of the account where this metric is  lo-
                               cated.  If you are performing this operation in
                               a monitoring account, use this to specify which
                               source account to retrieve this metric from.

              MetricThreshold -> (double)
                 This  value  is the threshold that the observed metric values
                 of the SLI metric are compared to.

              ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                 The arithmetic operation used when  comparing  the  specified
                 metric to the threshold.

          EvaluationType -> (string)
              Displays  whether  this is a period-based SLO or a request-based
              SLO.

          Goal -> (structure)
              This structure contains the attributes that determine  the  goal
              of  an SLO. This includes the time period for evaluation and the
              attainment threshold.

              Interval -> (tagged union structure)
                 The time period used to evaluate the SLO. It can be either  a
                 calendar interval or rolling interval.

                 If  you  omit this parameter, a rolling interval of 7 days is
                 used.

                 NOTE:
                     This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the follow-
                     ing top level keys can be set: RollingInterval, Calendar-
                     Interval.

                 RollingInterval -> (structure)
                     If the interval is a  rolling  interval,  this  structure
                     contains the interval specifications.

                     DurationUnit -> (string)
                        Specifies the rolling interval unit.

                     Duration -> (integer)
                        Specifies  the  duration of each rolling interval. For
                        example, if Duration is 7 and DurationUnit  is  DAY  ,
                        each rolling interval is seven days.

                 CalendarInterval -> (structure)
                     If  the  interval  is a calendar interval, this structure
                     contains the interval specifications.

                     StartTime -> (timestamp)
                        The date and time when you want the first interval  to
                        start.  Be  sure  to choose a time that configures the
                        intervals the way that you want. For example,  if  you
                        want  weekly  intervals starting on Mondays at 6 a.m.,
                        be sure to specify a start time that is a Monday at  6
                        a.m.

                        When  used in a raw HTTP Query API, it is formatted as
                        be epoch time in seconds. For example: 1698778057

                        As soon as one calendar interval ends,  another  auto-
                        matically begins.

                     DurationUnit -> (string)
                        Specifies the calendar interval unit.

                     Duration -> (integer)
                        Specifies  the duration of each calendar interval. For
                        example, if Duration is 1 and DurationUnit is MONTH  ,
                        each interval is one month, aligned with the calendar.

              AttainmentGoal -> (double)
                 The threshold that determines if the goal is being met.

                 If  this  is  a  period-based SLO, the attainment goal is the
                 percentage of good periods that meet the  threshold  require-
                 ments  to the total periods within the interval. For example,
                 an attainment goal of 99.9% means that within your  interval,
                 you  are  targeting  99.9%  of  the  periods to be in healthy
                 state.

                 If this is a request-based SLO, the attainment  goal  is  the
                 percentage  of  requests  that must be successful to meet the
                 attainment goal.

                 If you omit this parameter, 99 is used to  represent  99%  as
                 the attainment goal.

              WarningThreshold -> (double)
                 The percentage of remaining budget over total budget that you
                 want to get warnings for. If you omit this parameter, the de-
                 fault of 50.0 is used.
