OPTIONS
       --start-time (timestamp)
          The  start  of  the  time period to retrieve information about. When
          used in a raw HTTP Query API, it is formatted as be  epoch  time  in
          seconds. For example: 1698778057

          Your requested start time will be rounded to the nearest hour.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The  end of the time period to retrieve information about. When used
          in a raw HTTP Query API, it is formatted as be epoch  time  in  sec-
          onds. For example: 1698778057

          Your requested start time will be rounded to the nearest hour.

       --key-attributes (map)
          Use  this field to specify which service you want to retrieve infor-
          mation for. You must specify at least the Type , Name , and Environ-
          ment attributes.

          This is a string-to-string map. It can include the following fields.

          o Type designates the type of object this is.

          o ResourceType  specifies  the  type  of the resource. This field is
            used only when the value of the Type field is Resource or AWS::Re-
            source .

          o Name  specifies  the  name of the object. This is used only if the
            value of the Type field is Service , RemoteService , or  AWS::Ser-
            vice .

          o Identifier  identifies the resource objects of this resource. This
            is used only if the  value  of  the  Type  field  is  Resource  or
            AWS::Resource .

          o Environment specifies the location where this object is hosted, or
            what it belongs to.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

              (map)
                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

          MetricReferences -> (list)
              An  array  of structures that each contain information about one
              metric associated with this service.

              (structure)
                 This structure contains information about one CloudWatch met-
                 ric  associated  with  this  entity discovered by Application
                 Signals.

                 Namespace -> (string)
                     The namespace of the metric. For  more  information,  see
                     CloudWatchNamespaces .

                 MetricType -> (string)
                     Used  to display the appropriate statistics in the Cloud-
                     Watch console.

                 Dimensions -> (list)
                     An array of one or more dimensions  that  further  define
                     the     metric.     For     more     information,     see
                     CloudWatchDimensions .

                     (structure)
                        A dimension is a name/value pair that is part  of  the
                        identity  of  a metric. Because dimensions are part of
                        the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a
                        unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are
                        creating a new variation of that metric. For  example,
                        many Amazon EC2 metrics publish InstanceId as a dimen-
                        sion name, and the actual instance ID as the value for
                        that dimension.

                        You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.

                        Name -> (string)
                            The  name  of  the dimension. Dimension names must
                            contain only ASCII  characters,  must  include  at
                            least  one  non-whitespace  character,  and cannot
                            start with a colon (: ). ASCII control  characters
                            are not supported as part of dimension names.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  value of the dimension. Dimension values must
                            contain only ASCII characters and must include  at
                            least  one non-whitespace character. ASCII control
                            characters are not supported as part of  dimension
                            values.

                 MetricName -> (string)
                     The name of the metric.

          LogGroupReferences -> (list)
              An  array of string-to-string maps that each contain information
              about  one  log  group  associated  with  this   service.   Each
              string-to-string map includes the following fields:

              o "Type": "AWS::Resource"

              o "ResourceType": "AWS::Logs::LogGroup"

              o "Identifier": "*name-of-log-group* "

              (map)
                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       StartTime -> (timestamp)
          The  start  time of the data included in the response. In a raw HTTP
          Query API, it is formatted as be epoch time in seconds. For example:
          1698778057 .

          This  displays  the  time  that Application Signals used for the re-
          quest. It might not match  your  request  exactly,  because  it  was
          rounded to the nearest hour.

       EndTime -> (timestamp)
          The  end  time  of  the data included in the response. In a raw HTTP
          Query API, it is formatted as be epoch time in seconds. For example:
          1698778057 .

          This  displays  the  time  that Application Signals used for the re-
          quest. It might not match  your  request  exactly,  because  it  was
          rounded to the nearest hour.

       LogGroupReferences -> (list)
          An  array  of  string-to-string  maps  that each contain information
          about  one  log   group   associated   with   this   service.   Each
          string-to-string map includes the following fields:

          o "Type": "AWS::Resource"

          o "ResourceType": "AWS::Logs::LogGroup"

          o "Identifier": "*name-of-log-group* "

          (map)
              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)



                                                                 GET-SERVICE()
