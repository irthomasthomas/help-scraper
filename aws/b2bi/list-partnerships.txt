NAME
       list-partnerships -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the partnerships associated with your Amazon Web Services account
       for your current or specified region. A partnership represents the con-
       nection  between  you and your trading partner. It ties together a pro-
       file and one or more trading capabilities.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-partnerships is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: partnerships

OPTIONS
       --profile-id (string)
          Specifies  the  unique,  system-generated identifier for the profile
          connected to this partnership.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                     NOTE:
                        This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the fol-
                        lowing top level keys can be set: x12.

                     x12 -> (structure)

                               In X12 EDI messages,  delimiters  are  used  to
                               mark  the  end of segments or elements, and are
                               defined in the interchange control header.

                               senderIdQualifier -> (string)

                                   sending trading partner.

                                   fier  ) identifies the sender of the inter-
                                   change.

                               receiverIdQualifier -> (string)

                                   Qualifier  for  the  receiver ID. Together,
                                   the ID and qualifier uniquely identify  the
                                   receiving trading partner.

                               receiverId -> (string)

                                   the interchange.

                               repetitionSeparator -> (string)
                                   Located at position ISA-11 in  the  header.
                                   This  string  makes it easier when you need
                                   to group similar  adjacent  element  values
                                   together without using extra segments.

                                   NOTE:
                                      This  parameter is only honored for ver-

                                   The value "1" indicates that the sender  is
                                   requesting an interchange acknowledgment at
                                   receipt of the interchange. The  value  "0"
                                   is used otherwise.
