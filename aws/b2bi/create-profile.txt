OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Specifies the name of the profile.

       --email (string)
          Specifies the email address associated with this customer profile.

       --phone (string)
          Specifies the phone number associated with the profile.

       --business-name (string)
          Specifies the name for the business associated with this profile.

       --logging (string)
          Specifies whether or not logging is enabled for this profile.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DISABLED

       --client-token (string)
          Reserved for future use.

       --tags (list)
          Specifies  the  key-value pairs assigned to ARNs that you can use to
          group and search for resources by type. You can attach this metadata
          to  resources  (capabilities,  partnerships, and so on) for any pur-
          pose.

          (structure)
              Creates a key-value pair for a specific resource. Tags are meta-
              data  that  you  can  use to search for and group a resource for
              various purposes. You can apply tags to  capabilities,  partner-
              ships,  profiles  and transformers. A tag key can take more than
              one value. For example, to  group  capabilities  for  accounting
              purposes,  you  might  create  a tag called Group and assign the
              values Research and Accounting to that group.

              Key -> (string)
                 Specifies the name assigned to the tag that you create.

              Value -> (string)
                 Contains one or more values that you assigned to the key name
                 that you create.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
