          associated capabilities.

          outboundEdi -> (tagged union structure)
              A structure that contains the outbound EDI options.

              NOTE:
                 This  is  a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following
                 top level keys can be set: x12.

              x12 -> (structure)
                 A structure that contains an X12 envelope structure.

                 common -> (structure)
                     A container for the X12 outbound EDI headers.

                     interchangeControlHeaders -> (structure)
                        In X12 EDI messages, delimiters are used to  mark  the
                        end  of  segments  or elements, and are defined in the
                        interchange control header.

                        senderIdQualifier -> (string)
                            Located at position ISA-05 in the  header.  Quali-
                            fier for the sender ID. Together, the ID and qual-
                            ifier uniquely identify the sending trading  part-
                            ner.

                        senderId -> (string)
                            Located  at  position  ISA-06  in the header. This
                            value (along with the senderIdQualifier )  identi-
                            fies the sender of the interchange.

                            fier for the receiver ID.  Together,  the  ID  and
                            qualifier  uniquely identify the receiving trading
                            partner.

                            value  (along with the receiverIdQualifier ) iden-
                            tifies the intended recipient of the interchange.

                            string makes it easier when you need to group sim-
                            ilar adjacent element values together without  us-
                            ing extra segments.

                            an interchange acknowledgment at  receipt  of  the
                            interchange. The value "0" is used otherwise.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
