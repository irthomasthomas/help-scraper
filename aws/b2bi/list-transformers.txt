LIST-TRANSFORMERS()                                        LIST-TRANSFORMERS()



NAME
       list-transformers -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the available transformers. A transformer can take an EDI file as
       input and transform it into a JSON-or XML-formatted document.  Alterna-
       tively,  a transformer can take a JSON-or XML-formatted document as in-
       put and transform it into an EDI file.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-transformers is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: transformers

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       transformers -> (list)
          Returns an array of one or more transformer objects.

          For each transformer, a TransformerSummary object is  returned.  The
          TransformerSummary  contains  all  the details for a specific trans-
          former.

          (structure)
              Contains the details for a transformer object. A transformer can
              take  an  EDI  file  as  input  and  transform it into a JSON-or
              XML-formatted document. Alternatively, a transformer can take  a
              JSON-or XML-formatted document as input and transform it into an
              EDI file.

              transformerId -> (string)
                 Returns the system-assigned unique identifier for the  trans-
                 former.

              name -> (string)
                 Returns the descriptive name for the transformer.

              status -> (string)
                 Returns  the  state  of  the  newly  created transformer. The
                 transformer can be either active or inactive . For the trans-
                 former to be used in a capability, its status must active .

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 Returns  a timestamp indicating when the transformer was cre-
                 ated. For example, 2023-07-20T19:58:44.624Z .

              modifiedAt -> (timestamp)
                 Returns a timestamp representing the date and  time  for  the
                 most recent change for the transformer object.

              fileFormat -> (string)
                 Returns  that  the  currently  supported file formats for EDI
                 transformations are JSON and XML .

              mappingTemplate -> (string)
                 Returns the mapping template for the transformer.  This  tem-
                 plate  is  used  to  map the parsed EDI file using JSONata or
                 XSLT.

              ediType -> (tagged union structure)
                 Returns the details for the EDI standard that is  being  used
                 for the transformer. Currently, only X12 is supported. X12 is
                 a set of standards and  corresponding  messages  that  define
                 specific business documents.

                 NOTE:
                     This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the follow-
                     ing top level keys can be set: x12Details.

                 x12Details -> (structure)
                     Returns the details for the EDI standard  that  is  being
                     used  for  the  transformer.  Currently, only X12 is sup-
                     ported. X12 is a set of standards and corresponding  mes-
                     sages that define specific business documents.

                     transactionSet -> (string)
                        Returns an enumerated type where each value identifies
                        an X12 transaction set.  Transaction  sets  are  main-
                        tained by the X12 Accredited Standards Committee.

                     version -> (string)
                        Returns  the  version  to  use  for  the specified X12
                        transaction set.

              sampleDocument -> (string)
                 Returns a sample EDI document that is used by  a  transformer
                 as a guide for processing the EDI data.

              inputConversion -> (structure)
                 Returns  a structure that contains the format options for the
                 transformation.

                 fromFormat -> (string)
                     The format for the transformer input: currently on X12 is
                     supported.

                 formatOptions -> (tagged union structure)
                     A  structure  that contains the formatting options for an
                     inbound transformer.

                     NOTE:
                        This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the fol-
                        lowing top level keys can be set: x12.

                     x12 -> (structure)
                        A  structure that contains the X12 transaction set and
                        version. The X12 structure is  used  when  the  system
                        transforms an EDI (electronic data interchange) file.

                        NOTE:
                            If an EDI input file contains more than one trans-
                            action, each transaction must have the same trans-
                            action  set  and version, for example 214/4010. If
                            not, the transformer cannot parse the file.

                        transactionSet -> (string)
                            Returns an enumerated type where each value  iden-
                            tifies  an  X12  transaction set. Transaction sets
                            are maintained by  the  X12  Accredited  Standards
                            Committee.

                        version -> (string)
                            Returns  the  version to use for the specified X12
                            transaction set.

              mapping -> (structure)
                 Returns the structure that contains the mapping template  and
                 its language (either XSLT or JSONATA).

                 templateLanguage -> (string)
                     The transformation language for the template, either XSLT
                     or JSONATA.

                 template -> (string)
                     A string that represents the  mapping  template,  in  the
                     transformation language specified in templateLanguage .

              outputConversion -> (structure)
                 Returns  the OutputConversion object, which contains the for-
                 mat options for the outbound transformation.

                 toFormat -> (string)
                     The format for the output from an  outbound  transformer:
                     only X12 is currently supported.

                 formatOptions -> (tagged union structure)
                     A  structure  that  contains  the X12 transaction set and
                     version for the transformer output.

                     NOTE:
                        This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the fol-
                        lowing top level keys can be set: x12.

                     x12 -> (structure)
                        A  structure that contains the X12 transaction set and
                        version. The X12 structure is  used  when  the  system
                        transforms an EDI (electronic data interchange) file.

                        NOTE:
                            If an EDI input file contains more than one trans-
                            action, each transaction must have the same trans-
                            action  set  and version, for example 214/4010. If
                            not, the transformer cannot parse the file.

                        transactionSet -> (string)
                            Returns an enumerated type where each value  iden-
                            tifies  an  X12  transaction set. Transaction sets
                            are maintained by  the  X12  Accredited  Standards
                            Committee.
