OPTIONS
       --profile-id (string)
          Specifies the unique, system-generated identifier  for  the  profile
          connected to this partnership.

       --name (string)
          Specifies a descriptive name for the partnership.

       --email (string)
          Specifies the email address associated with this trading partner.

       --phone (string)
          Specifies the phone number associated with the partnership.

       --capabilities (list)
          Specifies  a  list of the capabilities associated with this partner-
          ship.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --client-token (string)
          Reserved for future use.

       --tags (list)
          Specifies the key-value pairs assigned to ARNs that you can  use  to
          group and search for resources by type. You can attach this metadata
          to resources (capabilities, partnerships, and so on)  for  any  pur-
          pose.

          (structure)
              Creates a key-value pair for a specific resource. Tags are meta-
              data that you can use to search for and  group  a  resource  for
              various  purposes.  You can apply tags to capabilities, partner-
              ships, profiles and transformers. A tag key can take  more  than
              one  value.  For  example,  to group capabilities for accounting
              purposes, you might create a tag called  Group  and  assign  the
              values Research and Accounting to that group.

              Key -> (string)
                 Specifies the name assigned to the tag that you create.

              Value -> (string)
                 Contains one or more values that you assigned to the key name
                 that you create.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
