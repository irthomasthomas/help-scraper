CREATE-CLUSTER()                                              CREATE-CLUSTER()



NAME
       create-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an empty cluster. Each cluster supports five nodes. You use the
       CreateJob action separately to create the jobs for each of these nodes.
       The cluster does not ship until these five node jobs have been created.
