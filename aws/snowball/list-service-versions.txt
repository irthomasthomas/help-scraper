OPTIONS
       --service-name (string)
          The  name  of the service for which you're requesting supported ver-
          sions.

          Possible values:

          o KUBERNETES

          o EKS_ANYWHERE

       --dependent-services (list)
          A list of names and versions of dependant services of the  requested
          service.

          (structure)
              The  name  and version of the service dependant on the requested
              service.

              ServiceName -> (string)
                 The name of the dependent service.

              ServiceVersion -> (structure)
                 The version of the dependent service.

                 Version -> (string)
                     The version number of the requested service.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ServiceName=string,ServiceVersion={Version=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ServiceName": "KUBERNETES"|"EKS_ANYWHERE",
              "ServiceVersion": {
                "Version": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of ListServiceVersions objects to return.

       --next-token (string)
          Because HTTP requests are stateless, this is the starting point  for
          the next list of returned ListServiceVersionsRequest versions.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
