GET-JOB-MANIFEST()                                          GET-JOB-MANIFEST()



NAME
       get-job-manifest -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a link to an Amazon S3 presigned URL for the manifest file as-
       sociated with the specified JobId value. You can  access  the  manifest
       file  for  up to 60 minutes after this request has been made. To access
       the manifest file after 60 minutes have passed, you'll have to make an-
       other call to the GetJobManifest action.

       The  manifest is an encrypted file that you can download after your job
       enters the WithCustomer status. This is the only valid status for call-
       ing this API as the manifest and UnlockCode code value are used for se-
       curing your device and should only be used when you  have  the  device.
       The  manifest is decrypted by using the UnlockCode code value, when you
       pass both values to the Snow device through the  Snowball  client  when
       the client is started for the first time.

       As  a  best practice, we recommend that you don't save a copy of an Un-
       lockCode value in the same location as the manifest file for that  job.
       Saving these separately helps prevent unauthorized parties from gaining
       access to the Snow device associated with that job.

       The credentials of a given job, including its manifest file and  unlock
       code, expire 360 days after the job is created.

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The ID for a job that you want to get the manifest file for, for ex-
          ample JID123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000 .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
