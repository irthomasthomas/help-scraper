LIST-CLUSTER-JOBS()                                        LIST-CLUSTER-JOBS()



NAME
       list-cluster-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  an array of JobListEntry objects of the specified length. Each
       JobListEntry object is for a job in the specified cluster and  contains
       a job's state, a job's ID, and other information.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-cluster-jobs  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: JobListEntries

OPTIONS
       --cluster-id (string)
          The 39-character ID for the cluster that you want to list, for exam-
          ple CID123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000 .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       JobListEntries -> (list)
          Each JobListEntry object contains a job's state, a job's ID,  and  a
          value  that  indicates whether the job is a job part, in the case of
          export jobs.

          (structure)
              Each JobListEntry object contains a job's state, a job's ID, and
              a  value  that  indicates  whether the job is a job part, in the
              case of an export job.

              JobId -> (string)
                 The  automatically  generated  ID  for  a  job,  for  example
                 JID123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000 .

              JobState -> (string)
                 The current state of this job.

              IsMaster -> (boolean)
                 A  value  that  indicates that this job is a main job. A main
                 job represents a successful request to create an export  job.
                 Main jobs aren't associated with any Snowballs. Instead, each
                 main job will have at least one job part, and each  job  part
                 is associated with a Snowball. It might take some time before
                 the job parts associated  with  a  particular  main  job  are
                 listed,  because  they are created after the main job is cre-
                 ated.

              JobType -> (string)
                 The type of job.

              SnowballType -> (string)
                 The type of device used with this job.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The creation date for this job.

              Description -> (string)
                 The optional description of this specific  job,  for  example
                 Important Photos 2016-08-11 .

       NextToken -> (string)
          HTTP  requests are stateless. If you use the automatically generated
          NextToken value in your next ListClusterJobsResult call,  your  list
          of returned jobs will start from this point in the array.
