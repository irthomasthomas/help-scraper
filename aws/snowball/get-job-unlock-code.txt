GET-JOB-UNLOCK-CODE()                                    GET-JOB-UNLOCK-CODE()



NAME
       get-job-unlock-code -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  UnlockCode code value for the specified job. A particular
       UnlockCode value can be accessed for up to 360 days after  the  associ-
       ated job has been created.

       The  UnlockCode value is a 29-character code with 25 alphanumeric char-
       acters and 4 hyphens. This code is used to decrypt  the  manifest  file
       when  it  is  passed along with the manifest to the Snow device through
       the Snowball client when the client is started for the first time.  The
       only  valid status for calling this API is WithCustomer as the manifest
       and Unlock code values are used for securing  your  device  and  should
       only be used when you have the device.

       As  a best practice, we recommend that you don't save a copy of the Un-
       lockCode in the same location as the manifest file for that job. Saving
       these separately helps prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access
       to the Snow device associated with that job.

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The ID for the job that you want to get the  UnlockCode  value  for,
          for example JID123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000 .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
