CREATE-TOPIC()                                                  CREATE-TOPIC()



NAME
       create-topic -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a topic to which notifications can be published. Users can cre-
       ate at most 100,000 standard topics (at most 1,000  FIFO  topics).  For
       more  information,  see  Creating an Amazon SNS topic in the Amazon SNS
       Developer Guide . This action is idempotent, so if  the  requester  al-
       ready  owns  a  topic  with the specified name, that topic's ARN is re-
       turned without creating a new topic.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the topic you want to create.

          Constraints: Topic names must be made up of only uppercase and  low-
          ercase ASCII letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens, and must be
          between 1 and 256 characters long.

          For a FIFO (first-in-first-out) topic, the name must  end  with  the
          .fifo suffix.

       --attributes (map)
          A map of attributes with their corresponding values.

          The  following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the spe-
          cial request parameters that the CreateTopic action uses:

          o DeliveryPolicy  The policy that defines  how  Amazon  SNS  retries
            failed deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints.

          o DisplayName   The  display  name  to use for a topic with SMS sub-
            scriptions.

          o FifoTopic  Set to true to create a FIFO topic.

          o Policy  The policy that defines who can access your topic. By  de-
            fault, only the topic owner can publish or subscribe to the topic.

          o SignatureVersion  The signature version corresponds to the hashing
            algorithm used while creating the signature of the  notifications,
            subscription  confirmations,  or unsubscribe confirmation messages
            sent by Amazon SNS. By default, SignatureVersion is set to 1.

          o TracingConfig  Tracing mode of an Amazon  SNS  topic.  By  default
            TracingConfig is set to PassThrough , and the topic passes through
            the tracing header it receives from an Amazon SNS publisher to its
            subscriptions.  If  set to Active, Amazon SNS will vend X-Ray seg-
            ment data to topic owner account if the sampled flag in the  trac-
            ing header is true. This is only supported on standard topics.

          The following attribute applies only to server-side encryption :

          o KmsMasterKeyId   The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer
            master key (CMK) for Amazon SNS or a custom CMK. For more informa-
            tion, see Key Terms . For more examples, see KeyId in the Key Man-
            agement Service API Reference .

          The following attributes apply only to FIFO topics :

          o FifoTopic  When this is set to true , a FIFO topic is created.

          o ContentBasedDeduplication  Enables content-based deduplication for
            FIFO topics.

            o By  default,  ContentBasedDeduplication is set to false . If you
              create a FIFO topic and this attribute is false , you must spec-
              ify  a  value  for  the MessageDeduplicationId parameter for the
              Publish action.

            o When you set ContentBasedDeduplication to true , Amazon SNS uses
              a  SHA-256 hash to generate the MessageDeduplicationId using the
              body of the message (but not the  attributes  of  the  message).
              (Optional)  To  override  the generated value, you can specify a
              value for the MessageDeduplicationId parameter for  the  Publish
              action.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --tags (list)
          The list of tags to add to a new topic.

          NOTE:
              To  be  able  to  tag  a  topic  on  creation, you must have the
              sns:CreateTopic and sns:TagResource permissions.

          (structure)
              The list of tags to be added to the specified topic.

              Key -> (string)
                 The required key portion of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional value portion of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --data-protection-policy (string)
          The body of the policy document you want to use for this topic.

          You can only add one policy per topic.

          The policy must be in JSON string format.

          Length Constraints: Maximum length of 30,720.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an SNS topic

       The following create-topic example creates an SNS topic named my-topic.

          aws sns create-topic \
              --name my-topic

       Output:

          {
