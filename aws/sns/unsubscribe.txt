UNSUBSCRIBE()                                                    UNSUBSCRIBE()



NAME
       unsubscribe -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a subscription. If the subscription requires authentication for
       deletion, only the owner of the subscription or the topic's  owner  can
       unsubscribe,  and  an Amazon Web Services signature is required. If the
       Unsubscribe call does not require authentication and the  requester  is
       not  the  subscription owner, a final cancellation message is delivered
       to the endpoint, so that the endpoint owner can easily  resubscribe  to
       the topic if the Unsubscribe request was unintended.

       NOTE:
          Amazon  SQS queue subscriptions require authentication for deletion.
          Only the owner of the subscription, or the owner of  the  topic  can
          unsubscribe using the required Amazon Web Services signature.

       This action is throttled at 100 transactions per second (TPS).

OPTIONS
       --subscription-arn (string)
          The ARN of the subscription to be deleted.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
