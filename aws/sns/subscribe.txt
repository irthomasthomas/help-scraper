SUBSCRIBE()                                                        SUBSCRIBE()



NAME
       subscribe -

DESCRIPTION
       Subscribes  an endpoint to an Amazon SNS topic. If the endpoint type is
       HTTP/S or email, or if the endpoint and the topic are not in  the  same
       Amazon  Web  Services account, the endpoint owner must run the Confirm-
       Subscription action to confirm the subscription.

       You call the ConfirmSubscription action with the token  from  the  sub-
       scription response. Confirmation tokens are valid for two days.

       This action is throttled at 100 transactions per second (TPS).

OPTIONS
       --topic-arn (string)
          The ARN of the topic you want to subscribe to.

       --protocol (string)
          The protocol that you want to use. Supported protocols include:

          o http  delivery of JSON-encoded message via HTTP POST

          o https  delivery of JSON-encoded message via HTTPS POST

          o email  delivery of message via SMTP

          o email-json  delivery of JSON-encoded message via SMTP

          o sms  delivery of message via SMS

          o sqs  delivery of JSON-encoded message to an Amazon SQS queue

          o application   delivery  of  JSON-encoded message to an EndpointArn
            for a mobile app and device

          o lambda  delivery of JSON-encoded message to an Lambda function

          o firehose  delivery of JSON-encoded message to  an  Amazon  Kinesis
            Data Firehose delivery stream.

       --attributes (map)
          A map of attributes with their corresponding values.

          The  following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the spe-
          cial request parameters that the Subscribe action uses:

          o DeliveryPolicy  The policy that defines  how  Amazon  SNS  retries
            failed deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints.

          o FilterPolicy  The simple JSON object that lets your subscriber re-
            ceive only a subset of messages, rather than receiving every  mes-
            sage published to the topic.

          o FilterPolicyScope   This  attribute  lets you choose the filtering
            scope by using one of the following string value types:

            o MessageAttributes (default)  The filter is applied on  the  mes-
              sage attributes.

            o MessageBody  The filter is applied on the message body.

          o RawMessageDelivery   When set to true , enables raw message deliv-
            ery to Amazon SQS or HTTP/S endpoints. This  eliminates  the  need
            for  the  endpoints to process JSON formatting, which is otherwise
            created for Amazon SNS metadata.

          o RedrivePolicy  When specified, sends undeliverable messages to the
            specified Amazon SQS dead-letter queue. Messages that can't be de-
            livered due to client errors (for  example,  when  the  subscribed
            endpoint  is  unreachable) or server errors (for example, when the
            service that powers the subscribed endpoint  becomes  unavailable)
            are  held  in the dead-letter queue for further analysis or repro-
            cessing.

          The following attribute applies only to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
          delivery stream subscriptions:

          o SubscriptionRoleArn   The ARN of the IAM role that has the follow-
            ing:

            o Permission to write to the Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream

            o Amazon SNS listed as a trusted entity

          Specifying a valid ARN for this attribute is  required  for  Kinesis
          Data  Firehose  delivery stream subscriptions. For more information,
          see Fanout to Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams in  the  Amazon
          SNS Developer Guide .

          The following attributes apply only to FIFO topics :

          o ReplayPolicy  Adds or updates an inline policy document for a sub-
            scription to replay messages stored in the  specified  Amazon  SNS
            topic.

          o ReplayStatus  Retrieves the status of the subscription message re-
            play, which can be one of the following:

            o Completed  The replay has successfully redelivered all messages,
              and  is  now  delivering  newly published messages. If an ending
              point was specified in the ReplayPolicy  then  the  subscription
              will no longer receive newly published messages.

            o In progress  The replay is currently replaying the selected mes-
              sages.

            o Failed  The replay was unable to complete.

            o Pending  The default state while the replay initiates.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --return-subscription-arn | --no-return-subscription-arn (boolean)
          Sets whether the response from the Subscribe  request  includes  the
          subscription ARN, even if the subscription is not yet confirmed.

          If you set this parameter to true , the response includes the ARN in
          all cases, even if the subscription is not yet confirmed.  In  addi-
          tion  to  the ARN for confirmed subscriptions, the response also in-
          cludes the pending subscription ARN  value  for  subscriptions  that
          aren't yet confirmed. A subscription becomes confirmed when the sub-
          scriber calls the ConfirmSubscription action with a confirmation to-
          ken.

          The default value is false .

       --notification-endpoint (string)
          The  endpoint that you want to receive notifications. Endpoints vary
          by protocol:

          o For the http protocol, the (public) endpoint is  a  URL  beginning
            with http:// .

          o For  the  https protocol, the (public) endpoint is a URL beginning
            with https:// .

          o For the email protocol, the endpoint is an email address.

          o For the email-json protocol, the endpoint is an email address.

          o For the sms protocol, the endpoint is a phone number of an SMS-en-
            abled device.

          o For  the  sqs  protocol,  the endpoint is the ARN of an Amazon SQS
            queue.

          o For the application protocol, the endpoint is the EndpointArn of a
            mobile app and device.

          o For  the  lambda  protocol,  the  endpoint is the ARN of an Lambda
            function.

          o For the firehose protocol, the endpoint is the ARN  of  an  Amazon
            Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To subscribe to a topic

       The  following  subscribe  command  subscribes  an email address to the
       specified topic.

          aws sns subscribe \
              --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-topic \
              --protocol email \
              --notification-endpoint my-email@example.com

       Output:

          {
              "SubscriptionArn": "pending confirmation"
          }

OUTPUT
       SubscriptionArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the subscription if it is confirmed, or the string "pend-
          ing  confirmation"  if  the subscription requires confirmation. How-
          ever, if the API request parameter  ReturnSubscriptionArn  is  true,
          then the value is always the subscription ARN, even if the subscrip-
          tion requires confirmation.
