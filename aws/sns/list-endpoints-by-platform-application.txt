LIST-ENDPOINTS-BY-PLATFORM-APPLICATIONLIST-ENDPOINTS-BY-PLATFORM-APPLICATION()



NAME
       list-endpoints-by-platform-application -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the endpoints and endpoint attributes for devices in a supported
       push notification service, such as GCM (Firebase Cloud  Messaging)  and
       APNS.  The results for ListEndpointsByPlatformApplication are paginated
       and return a limited list  of  endpoints,  up  to  100.  If  additional
       records  are  available  after the first page results, then a NextToken
       string will be returned. To receive the next page,  you  call  ListEnd-
       pointsByPlatformApplication  again  using the NextToken string received
       from the previous call. When there are no more records to return, Next-
       Token  will  be null. For more information, see Using Amazon SNS Mobile
       Push Notifications .

       This action is throttled at 30 transactions per second (TPS).

       list-endpoints-by-platform-application is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  ar-
       gument.   When  using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: Endpoints

OPTIONS
       --platform-application-arn (string)
          PlatformApplicationArn  for  ListEndpointsByPlatformApplicationInput
          action.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
