OPTIONS
       --platform-application-arn (string)
          PlatformApplicationArn for SetPlatformApplicationAttributes action.

       --attributes (map)
          A map of the platform application attributes. Attributes in this map
          include the following:

          o PlatformCredential   The credential received from the notification
            service.

            o For ADM, PlatformCredential is client secret.

            o For Apple Services using certificate  credentials,  PlatformCre-
              dential is private key.

            o For  Apple  Services using token credentials, PlatformCredential
              is signing key.

            o For GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) using key credentials,  there
              is no PlatformPrincipal . The PlatformCredential is API key .

            o For  GCM  (Firebase  Cloud  Messaging)  using token credentials,
              there is no PlatformPrincipal . The PlatformCredential is a JSON
              formatted  private  key file. When using the Amazon Web Services
              CLI, the file must be in string format  and  special  characters
              must be ignored. To format the file correctly, Amazon SNS recom-
              mends using the following command:  SERVICE_JSON=`jq  @json  <<<
              cat service.json` .

          o PlatformPrincipal   The  principal  received from the notification
            service.

            o For ADM, PlatformPrincipal is client id.

            o For Apple Services using certificate credentials,  PlatformPrin-
              cipal is SSL certificate.

            o For Apple Services using token credentials, PlatformPrincipal is
              signing key ID.

            o For GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging), there is no  PlatformPrinci-
              pal .

          o EventEndpointCreated  Topic ARN to which EndpointCreated event no-
            tifications are sent.

          o EventEndpointDeleted  Topic ARN to which EndpointDeleted event no-
            tifications are sent.

          o EventEndpointUpdated   Topic ARN to which EndpointUpdate event no-
            tifications are sent.

          o EventDeliveryFailure  Topic ARN to which DeliveryFailure event no-
            tifications  are sent upon Direct Publish delivery failure (perma-
            nent) to one of the application's endpoints.

          o SuccessFeedbackRoleArn  IAM role ARN used to give Amazon SNS write
            access to use CloudWatch Logs on your behalf.

          o FailureFeedbackRoleArn  IAM role ARN used to give Amazon SNS write
            access to use CloudWatch Logs on your behalf.

          o SuccessFeedbackSampleRate  Sample rate percentage (0-100) of  suc-
            cessfully delivered messages.

          The  following attributes only apply to APNs token-based authentica-
          tion:

          o ApplePlatformTeamID  The identifier that's assigned to your  Apple
            developer account team.

          o ApplePlatformBundleID   The  bundle  identifier that's assigned to
            your iOS app.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To set platform application attributes

       The  following  set-platform-application-attributes  example  sets  the
       EventDeliveryFailure  attribute  for the specified platform application
       to the ARN of the specified Amazon SNS topic.

          aws sns set-platform-application-attributes \
              --platform-application-arn arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:app/GCM/MyApplication \
              --attributes EventDeliveryFailure=arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:AnotherTopic

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
