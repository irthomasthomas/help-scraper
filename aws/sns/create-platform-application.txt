CREATE-PLATFORM-APPLICATION()                    CREATE-PLATFORM-APPLICATION()



NAME
       create-platform-application -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a platform application object for one of the supported push no-
       tification services, such as APNS and GCM (Firebase  Cloud  Messaging),
       to  which  devices and mobile apps may register. You must specify Plat-
       formPrincipal and PlatformCredential attributes  when  using  the  Cre-
       atePlatformApplication action.
          PlatformPrincipal and PlatformCredential are received from the noti-
          fication service.

       o For ADM, PlatformPrincipal is client  id  and  PlatformCredential  is
         client secret .

       o For  APNS  and  APNS_SANDBOX using certificate credentials, Platform-
         Principal is SSL certificate and PlatformCredential is private key .

       o For APNS and APNS_SANDBOX using token credentials,  PlatformPrincipal
         is signing key ID and PlatformCredential is signing key .

       o For Baidu, PlatformPrincipal is API key and PlatformCredential is se-
         cret key .

       o For GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) using key credentials, there is no
         PlatformPrincipal . The PlatformCredential is API key .

       o For  GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) using token credentials, there is
         no PlatformPrincipal . The PlatformCredential  is  a  JSON  formatted
         private  key  file.  When using the Amazon Web Services CLI, the file
         must be in string format and special characters must be  ignored.  To
         format  the file correctly, Amazon SNS recommends using the following
         command: SERVICE_JSON=`jq @json <<< cat service.json` .

       o For MPNS, PlatformPrincipal is TLS certificate and PlatformCredential
         is private key .

       o For  WNS,  PlatformPrincipal is Package Security Identifier and Plat-
         formCredential is secret key .

       You can use the returned PlatformApplicationArn as an attribute for the
       CreatePlatformEndpoint action.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Application  names  must  be made up of only uppercase and lowercase
          ASCII letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, and periods, and  must
          be between 1 and 256 characters long.

       --platform (string)
          The  following  platforms  are supported: ADM (Amazon Device Messag-
          ing), APNS (Apple Push Notification Service), APNS_SANDBOX, and  GCM
          (Firebase Cloud Messaging).

       --attributes (map)
          For  a  list  of  attributes, see ` SetPlatformApplicationAttributes
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_SetPlatformApplicationAttributes.html`__
          .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a platform application

       The  following  create-platform-application  example  creates  a Google
       Firebase platform application using the specified platform credential.

          aws sns create-platform-application \
              --name MyApplication \
              --platform GCM \
              --attributes PlatformCredential=EXAMPLEabcd12345jklm67890stuv12345bcdef

       Output:

          {
              "PlatformApplicationArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:app/GCM/MyApplication"
          }

OUTPUT
       PlatformApplicationArn -> (string)
          PlatformApplicationArn is returned.
