       --topic-arn (string)
          The ARN of the topic to modify.

       --attribute-name (string)
          A map of attributes with their corresponding values.

          The  following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the spe-
          cial request parameters that the SetTopicAttributes action uses:

          o ApplicationSuccessFeedbackRoleArn  Indicates failed message deliv-
            ery  status  for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to a plat-
            form application endpoint.

          o DeliveryPolicy  The policy that defines  how  Amazon  SNS  retries
            failed deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints.

          o DisplayName   The  display  name  to use for a topic with SMS sub-
            scriptions.

          o Policy  The policy that defines who can access your topic. By  de-
            fault, only the topic owner can publish or subscribe to the topic.

          o TracingConfig   Tracing  mode  of  an Amazon SNS topic. By default
            TracingConfig is set to PassThrough , and the topic passes through
            the tracing header it receives from an Amazon SNS publisher to its
            subscriptions. If set to Active , Amazon SNS will vend X-Ray  seg-
            ment  data to topic owner account if the sampled flag in the trac-
            ing header is true. This is only supported on standard topics.

          o HTTP

            o HTTPSuccessFeedbackRoleArn  Indicates successful message  deliv-
              ery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an HTTP
              endpoint.

            o HTTPSuccessFeedbackSampleRate  Indicates percentage of  success-
              ful  messages  to  sample  for  an Amazon SNS topic that is sub-
              scribed to an HTTP endpoint.

            o HTTPFailureFeedbackRoleArn  Indicates  failed  message  delivery
              status  for  an  Amazon  SNS topic that is subscribed to an HTTP
              endpoint.

            o FirehoseSuccessFeedbackRoleArn  Indicates successful message de-
              livery  status  for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an
              Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose endpoint.

            o FirehoseSuccessFeedbackSampleRate  Indicates percentage of  suc-
              cessful  messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is sub-
              scribed to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose endpoint.

            o FirehoseFailureFeedbackRoleArn  Indicates failed message  deliv-
              ery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Ama-
              zon Kinesis Data Firehose endpoint.

          o Lambda

            o LambdaSuccessFeedbackRoleArn  Indicates successful  message  de-
              livery  status  for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an
              Lambda endpoint.

            o LambdaSuccessFeedbackSampleRate  Indicates  percentage  of  suc-
              cessful  messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is sub-

              status  for  an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Lambda
              endpoint.

          o Platform application endpoint

            o ApplicationSuccessFeedbackRoleArn  Indicates successful  message
              delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an
              Amazon Web Services application endpoint.

            o ApplicationSuccessFeedbackSampleRate   Indicates  percentage  of
              successful  messages  to  sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is
              subscribed to an Amazon Web Services application endpoint.

            o ApplicationFailureFeedbackRoleArn  Indicates failed message  de-
              livery  status  for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an
              Amazon Web Services application endpoint.

          NOTE:
              In addition to being able to configure topic attributes for mes-
              sage delivery status of notification messages sent to Amazon SNS
              application endpoints, you can also  configure  application  at-
              tributes  for  the delivery status of push notification messages
              sent to push notification services.

              For example, For more information, see Using Amazon SNS Applica-
              tion Attributes for Message Delivery Status .

          o Amazon SQS

            o SQSSuccessFeedbackRoleArn  Indicates successful message delivery
              status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to  an  Amazon
              SQS endpoint.

            o SQSSuccessFeedbackSampleRate  Indicates percentage of successful
              messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to
              an Amazon SQS endpoint.

            o SQSFailureFeedbackRoleArn   Indicates  failed  message  delivery
              status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to  an  Amazon
              SQS endpoint.

          NOTE:
              The  <ENDPOINT>SuccessFeedbackRoleArn and <ENDPOINT>FailureFeed-
              backRoleArn attributes are used to give Amazon SNS write  access
              to  use  CloudWatch  Logs on your behalf. The <ENDPOINT>Success-
              FeedbackSampleRate attribute is for specifying the  sample  rate
              percentage (0-100) of successfully delivered messages. After you
              configure the <ENDPOINT>FailureFeedbackRoleArn  attribute,  then
              all failed message deliveries generate CloudWatch Logs.

          The following attribute applies only to server-side-encryption :

          o KmsMasterKeyId   The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer
            master key (CMK) for Amazon SNS or a custom CMK. For more informa-
            tion, see Key Terms . For more examples, see KeyId in the Key Man-
            agement Service API Reference .

          o SignatureVersion  The signature version corresponds to the hashing
            algorithm  used while creating the signature of the notifications,
            subscription confirmations, or unsubscribe  confirmation  messages
            sent by Amazon SNS. By default, SignatureVersion is set to 1 .

          The following attribute applies only to FIFO topics :

          o ContentBasedDeduplication  Enables content-based deduplication for
            FIFO topics.

            o By default, ContentBasedDeduplication is set to false .  If  you
              create a FIFO topic and this attribute is false , you must spec-
              ify a value for the  MessageDeduplicationId  parameter  for  the
              Publish action.

            o When you set ContentBasedDeduplication to true , Amazon SNS uses
              a SHA-256 hash to generate the MessageDeduplicationId using  the
              body  of  the  message  (but not the attributes of the message).
              (Optional) To override the generated value, you  can  specify  a
              value  for  the MessageDeduplicationId parameter for the Publish
              action.

       --attribute-value (string)
          The new value for the attribute.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To set an attribute for a topic

       The  following set-topic-attributes example sets the DisplayName attri-
       bute for the specified topic.

          aws sns set-topic-attributes \
              --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:MyTopic \
              --attribute-name DisplayName \
              --attribute-value MyTopicDisplayName

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
