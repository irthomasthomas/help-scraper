CREATE-PLATFORM-ENDPOINT()                          CREATE-PLATFORM-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       create-platform-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an endpoint for a device and mobile app on one of the supported
       push notification services, such as GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging)  and
       APNS.  CreatePlatformEndpoint  requires the PlatformApplicationArn that
       is returned from CreatePlatformApplication . You can use  the  returned
       EndpointArn  to  send a message to a mobile app or by the Subscribe ac-
       tion for subscription to a topic. The CreatePlatformEndpoint action  is
       idempotent,  so if the requester already owns an endpoint with the same
       device token and attributes, that endpoint's ARN  is  returned  without
       creating a new endpoint. For more information, see Using Amazon SNS Mo-
       bile Push Notifications .

       When using CreatePlatformEndpoint with Baidu, two  attributes  must  be
       provided:  ChannelId  and UserId. The token field must also contain the
       ChannelId. For more information, see Creating an  Amazon  SNS  Endpoint
       for Baidu .

SYNOPSIS
            create-platform-endpoint
          --platform-application-arn <value>
          --token <value>
          [--custom-user-data <value>]
          [--attributes <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --platform-application-arn (string)
          PlatformApplicationArn  returned  from  CreatePlatformApplication is
          used to create a an endpoint.

       --token (string)
          Unique identifier created by the notification service for an app  on
          a  device. The specific name for Token will vary, depending on which
          notification service is being used. For example, when using APNS  as
          the  notification service, you need the device token. Alternatively,
          when using GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) or ADM, the  device  token
          equivalent is called the registration ID.

       --custom-user-data (string)
          Arbitrary  user data to associate with the endpoint. Amazon SNS does
          not use this data. The data must be in UTF-8 format  and  less  than
          2KB.

       --attributes (map)
          For a list of attributes, see SetEndpointAttributes .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a platform application endpoint

       The  following create-platform-endpoint example creates an endpoint for
       the specified platform application using the specified token.

          aws sns create-platform-endpoint \
              --platform-application-arn arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:app/GCM/MyApplication \
              --token EXAMPLE12345...

       Output:

          {
                "EndpointArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:1234567890:endpoint/GCM/MyApplication/12345678-abcd-9012-efgh-345678901234"
          }

OUTPUT
       EndpointArn -> (string)
          EndpointArn returned from CreateEndpoint action.
