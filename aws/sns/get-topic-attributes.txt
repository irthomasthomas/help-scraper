OPTIONS
       --topic-arn (string)
          The ARN of the topic whose properties you want to get.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve the attributes of a topic

       The  following get-topic-attributes example displays the attributes for
       the specified topic.

          aws sns get-topic-attributes \
              --topic-arn "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-topic"

       Output:

          {
              "Attributes": {
                  "SubscriptionsConfirmed": "1",
                  "DisplayName": "my-topic",
                  "SubscriptionsDeleted": "0",
                  "EffectiveDeliveryPolicy": "{\"http\":{\"defaultHealthyRetryPolicy\":{\"minDelayTarget\":20,\"maxDelayTarget\":20,\"numRetries\":3,\"numMaxDelayRetries\":0,\"numNoDelayRetries\":0,\"numMinDelayRetries\":0,\"backoffFunction\":\"linear\"},\"disableSubscriptionOverrides\":false}}",
                  "Owner": "123456789012",
                  "Policy": "{\"Version\":\"2008-10-17\",\"Id\":\"__default_policy_ID\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"__default_statement_ID\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"AWS\":\"*\"},\"Action\":[\"SNS:Subscribe\",\"SNS:ListSubscriptionsByTopic\",\"SNS:DeleteTopic\",\"SNS:GetTopicAttributes\",\"SNS:Publish\",\"SNS:RemovePermission\",\"SNS:AddPermission\",\"SNS:SetTopicAttributes\"],\"Resource\":\"arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-topic\",\"Condition\":{\"StringEquals\":{\"AWS:SourceOwner\":\"0123456789012\"}}}]}",
                  "TopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-topic",
                  "SubscriptionsPending": "0"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Attributes -> (map)
          A map of the topic's attributes. Attributes in this map include  the
          following:

          o DeliveryPolicy   The  JSON  serialization  of the topic's delivery
            policy.

          o DisplayName  The human-readable name used in the  From  field  for
            notifications to email and email-json endpoints.

          o EffectiveDeliveryPolicy   The  JSON serialization of the effective
            delivery policy, taking system defaults into account.

          o Owner  The Amazon Web Services account ID of the topic's owner.

          o Policy  The JSON serialization of the topic's access control  pol-
            icy.

          o SignatureVersion  The signature version corresponds to the hashing
            algorithm used while creating the signature of the  notifications,
            subscription  confirmations,  or unsubscribe confirmation messages
            sent by Amazon SNS.

            o By default, SignatureVersion is set to 1 . The  signature  is  a
              Base64-encoded SHA1withRSA signature.

            o When  you  set  SignatureVersion  to  2  .  Amazon  SNS  uses  a
              Base64-encoded SHA256withRSA signature.

            NOTE:
                If the API response does not include the SignatureVersion  at-
                tribute,  it means that the SignatureVersion for the topic has
                value 1 .

          o SubscriptionsConfirmed  The number of confirmed subscriptions  for
            the topic.

          o SubscriptionsDeleted   The number of deleted subscriptions for the
            topic.

          o SubscriptionsPending  The number of subscriptions pending  confir-
            mation for the topic.

          o TopicArn  The topic's ARN.

          o TracingConfig   Tracing  mode  of  an Amazon SNS topic. By default
            TracingConfig is set to PassThrough , and the topic passes through
            the tracing header it receives from an Amazon SNS publisher to its
            subscriptions. If set to Active , Amazon SNS will vend X-Ray  seg-
            ment  data to topic owner account if the sampled flag in the trac-
            ing header is true. This is only supported on standard topics.

          The following attribute applies only to server-side-encryption :

          o KmsMasterKeyId - The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer
            master key (CMK) for Amazon SNS or a custom CMK. For more informa-
            tion, see Key Terms . For more examples, see KeyId in the Key Man-
            agement Service API Reference .

          The following attributes apply only to FIFO topics :

          o ArchivePolicy   The policy that sets the retention period for mes-
            sages stored in the message archive of an Amazon SNS FIFO topic.

          o BeginningArchiveTime  The earliest starting point at which a  mes-
            sage  in  the  topics  archive can be replayed from. This point in
            time is based on the configured message retention  period  set  by
            the topics message archiving policy.

          o ContentBasedDeduplication  Enables content-based deduplication for
            FIFO topics.

            o By default, ContentBasedDeduplication is set to false .  If  you
              create a FIFO topic and this attribute is false , you must spec-
              ify a value for the  MessageDeduplicationId  parameter  for  the
              Publish action.

            o When you set ContentBasedDeduplication to true , Amazon SNS uses
              a SHA-256 hash to generate the MessageDeduplicationId using  the
              body  of  the  message  (but not the attributes of the message).
              (Optional) To override the generated value, you  can  specify  a
              value  for  the MessageDeduplicationId parameter for the Publish
              action.

          o FifoTopic  When this is set to true , a FIFO topic is created.
