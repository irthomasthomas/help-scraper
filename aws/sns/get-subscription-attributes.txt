            get-subscription-attributes
          --subscription-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]

          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-arn (string)
          The ARN of the subscription whose properties you want to get.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve subscription attributes for a topic

       The  following  get-subscription-attributes  displays the attributes of
       the specified subscription. You can get the subscription-arn  from  the
       output of the list-subscriptions command.

          aws sns get-subscription-attributes \
              --subscription-arn "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-topic:8a21d249-4329-4871-acc6-7be709c6ea7f"

       Output:

          {
              "Attributes": {
                  "Endpoint": "my-email@example.com",
                  "Protocol": "email",
                  "RawMessageDelivery": "false",
                  "ConfirmationWasAuthenticated": "false",
                  "Owner": "123456789012",
                  "SubscriptionArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-topic:8a21d249-4329-4871-acc6-7be709c6ea7f",
                  "TopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-topic"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Attributes -> (map)
          A  map  of the subscription's attributes. Attributes in this map in-
          clude the following:

          o ConfirmationWasAuthenticated  true if the  subscription  confirma-
            tion request was authenticated.

          o DeliveryPolicy   The  JSON serialization of the subscription's de-
            livery policy.

          o EffectiveDeliveryPolicy  The JSON serialization of  the  effective
            delivery  policy that takes into account the topic delivery policy
            and account system defaults.

          o FilterPolicy  The filter policy JSON that is assigned to the  sub-
            scription.  For more information, see Amazon SNS Message Filtering
            in the Amazon SNS Developer Guide .

          o FilterPolicyScope  This attribute lets you  choose  the  filtering
            scope by using one of the following string value types:

            o MessageAttributes  (default)   The filter is applied on the mes-
              sage attributes.

            o MessageBody  The filter is applied on the message body.

          o Owner  The Amazon Web Services account ID  of  the  subscription's
            owner.

          o PendingConfirmation   true  if  the  subscription hasn't been con-
            firmed. To confirm a pending subscription,  call  the  ConfirmSub-
            scription action with a confirmation token.

          o RawMessageDelivery   true  if  raw message delivery is enabled for
            the subscription. Raw messages are free of JSON formatting and can
            be sent to HTTP/S and Amazon SQS endpoints.

          o RedrivePolicy  When specified, sends undeliverable messages to the
            specified Amazon SQS dead-letter queue. Messages that can't be de-
            livered  due  to  client  errors (for example, when the subscribed
            endpoint is unreachable) or server errors (for example,  when  the
            service  that  powers the subscribed endpoint becomes unavailable)
            are held in the dead-letter queue for further analysis  or  repro-
            cessing.

          o SubscriptionArn  The subscription's ARN.

          o TopicArn  The topic ARN that the subscription is associated with.

          The  following attribute applies only to Amazon Data Firehose deliv-
          ery stream subscriptions:

          o SubscriptionRoleArn  The ARN of the IAM role that has the  follow-
            ing:

            o Permission to write to the Firehose delivery stream

            o Amazon SNS listed as a trusted entity

          Specifying  a  valid ARN for this attribute is required for Firehose
          delivery stream subscriptions. For more information, see  Fanout  to
          Firehose delivery streams in the Amazon SNS Developer Guide .
