OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the project for which you want to
          update network profile settings.

       --name (string)
          The name of the network profile about which you are returning infor-
          mation.

       --description (string)
          The description of the network profile about which you are returning
          information.

       --type (string)
          The type of network profile to return information about. Valid  val-
          ues are listed here.

          Possible values:

          o CURATED

          o PRIVATE

       --uplink-bandwidth-bits (long)
          The data throughput rate in bits per second, as an integer from 0 to
          104857600.

       --downlink-bandwidth-bits (long)
          The data throughput rate in bits per second, as an integer from 0 to
          104857600.

       --uplink-delay-ms (long)
          Delay  time for all packets to destination in milliseconds as an in-
          teger from 0 to 2000.

       --downlink-delay-ms (long)
          Delay time for all packets to destination in milliseconds as an  in-
          teger from 0 to 2000.

       --uplink-jitter-ms (long)
          Time  variation  in the delay of received packets in milliseconds as
          an integer from 0 to 2000.

       --downlink-jitter-ms (long)
          Time variation in the delay of received packets in  milliseconds  as
          an integer from 0 to 2000.

       --uplink-loss-percent (integer)
          Proportion  of transmitted packets that fail to arrive from 0 to 100
          percent.

       --downlink-loss-percent (integer)
          Proportion of received packets that fail to arrive  from  0  to  100
          percent.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
