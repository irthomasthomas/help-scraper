LIST-DEVICE-POOLS()                                        LIST-DEVICE-POOLS()



NAME
       list-device-pools -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about device pools.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-device-pools  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: devicePools

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The project ARN.

       --type (string)
          The device pools' type.

          Allowed values include:

          o CURATED: A device pool that is created and managed by  AWS  Device
            Farm.

          o PRIVATE:  A  device pool that is created and managed by the device
            pool developer.

          Possible values:

          o CURATED

          o PRIVATE

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                     operator -> (string)
                        Specifies how Device Farm compares the  rule's  attri-
                        bute  to  the  value.  For the operators that are sup-
                        ported by each attribute, see the  attribute  descrip-
                        tions.

                     value -> (string)
                        The rule's value.

              maxDevices -> (integer)
                 The number of devices that Device Farm can add to your device
                 pool. Device Farm adds devices that are  available  and  meet
                 the criteria that you assign for the rules parameter. Depend-
                 ing on how many devices meet these constraints,  your  device
                 pool  might contain fewer devices than the value for this pa-
                 rameter.

                 By specifying the maximum number of devices, you can  control
                 the costs that you incur by running tests.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  the  number  of  items that are returned is significantly large,
          this is an identifier that is also returned. It can  be  used  in  a
          subsequent call to this operation to return the next set of items in
          the list.
