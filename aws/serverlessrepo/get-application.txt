OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the application.

       --semantic-version (string)
          The semantic version of the application to get.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

                     (string)

                 ConstraintDescription -> (string)
                     A string that explains a constraint when  the  constraint
                     is  violated.  For example, without a constraint descrip-
                     tion,  a  parameter  that  has  an  allowed  pattern   of
                     [A-Za-z0-9]+  displays  the  following error message when
                     the user specifies an invalid value:

                     Malformed input-Parameter MyParameter must match  pattern
                     [A-Za-z0-9]+

                     By adding a constraint description, such as "must contain
                     only uppercase and lowercase letters  and  numbers,"  you
                     can display the following customized error message:

                     Malformed  input-Parameter  MyParameter must contain only
                     uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers.

                 DefaultValue -> (string)
                     A value of the appropriate type for the template  to  use
                     if  no value is specified when a stack is created. If you
                     define constraints for the parameter, you must specify  a
                     value that adheres to those constraints.

                 Description -> (string)
                     A string of up to 4,000 characters that describes the pa-
                     rameter.

                 MaxLength -> (integer)
                     An integer value that determines the  largest  number  of
                     characters that you want to allow for String types.

                 MaxValue -> (integer)
                     A numeric value that determines the largest numeric value
                     that you want to allow for Number types.

                 MinLength -> (integer)
                     An integer value that determines the smallest  number  of
                     characters that you want to allow for String types.

                 MinValue -> (integer)
                     A  numeric  value  that  determines  the smallest numeric
                     value that you want to allow for Number types.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the parameter.

                 NoEcho -> (boolean)
                     Whether to mask the parameter value whenever anyone makes
                     a  call that describes the stack. If you set the value to
                     true, the parameter value is masked with asterisks (*).

                 ReferencedByResources -> (list)
                     A list of AWS SAM resources that use this parameter.

                     (string)

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of the parameter.

                     Valid values: String | Number | List<Number>  |  CommaDe-
                     limitedList

                     String: A literal string.

                     For example, users can specify "MyUserName".

                     Number: An integer or float. AWS CloudFormation validates
                     the parameter value as a number. However,  when  you  use
                     the parameter elsewhere in your template (for example, by
                     using the Ref intrinsic function),  the  parameter  value
                     becomes a string.

                     For example, users might specify "8888".

                     List<Number>:  An  array  of  integers or floats that are
                     separated by commas. AWS CloudFormation validates the pa-
                     rameter  value  as numbers. However, when you use the pa-
                     rameter elsewhere in your template (for example, by using
                     the  Ref intrinsic function), the parameter value becomes
                     a list of strings.

                     For example, users might specify "80,20",  and  then  Ref
                     results in ["80","20"].

                     CommaDelimitedList:  An array of literal strings that are
                     separated by commas. The total number of  strings  should
                     be  one  more than the total number of commas. Also, each
                     member string is space-trimmed.

                     For example, users  might  specify  "test,dev,prod",  and
                     then Ref results in ["test","dev","prod"].

          RequiredCapabilities -> (list)
              A  list  of  values  that you must specify before you can deploy
              certain applications. Some applications might include  resources
              that can affect permissions in your AWS account, for example, by
              creating new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For
              those  applications, you must explicitly acknowledge their capa-
              bilities by specifying this parameter.

              The only valid values are CAPABILITY_IAM,  CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM,
              CAPABILITY_RESOURCE_POLICY, and CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND.

              The following resources require you to specify CAPABILITY_IAM or
              CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM:             AWS::IAM::Group              ,
              AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile     ,     AWS::IAM::Policy    ,    and
              AWS::IAM::Role . If the application contains IAM resources,  you
              can  specify  either  CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM. If
              the application contains IAM resources with  custom  names,  you
              must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.

              The  following  resources  require you to specify CAPABILITY_RE-
              SOURCE_POLICY:  AWS::Lambda::Permission  ,   AWS::IAM:Policy   ,
              AWS::ApplicationAutoScaling::ScalingPolicy                     ,
              AWS::S3::BucketPolicy    ,    AWS::SQS::QueuePolicy    ,     and
              AWS::SNS::TopicPolicy .

              Applications  that  contain  one or more nested applications re-
              quire you to specify CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND.

              If your application template  contains  any  of  the  above  re-
              sources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated
              with the application before deploying. If you don't specify this
              parameter  for  an  application  that requires capabilities, the
              call will fail.

              (string)
                 Values that must be specified in order to deploy some  appli-
                 cations.

          ResourcesSupported -> (boolean)
              Whether  all  of the AWS resources contained in this application
              are supported in the region in which it is being retrieved.

          SemanticVersion -> (string)
              The semantic version of the application:
                 https://semver.org/

          SourceCodeArchiveUrl -> (string)
              A link to the S3 object that contains the  ZIP  archive  of  the
              source code for this version of your application.

              Maximum size 50 MB

          SourceCodeUrl -> (string)
              A link to a public repository for the source code of your appli-
              cation, for example the URL of a specific GitHub commit.

          TemplateUrl -> (string)
              A link to the packaged AWS SAM template of your application.
