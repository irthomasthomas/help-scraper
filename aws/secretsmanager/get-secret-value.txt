GET-SECRET-VALUE()                                          GET-SECRET-VALUE()



NAME
       get-secret-value -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the contents of the encrypted fields SecretString or Secret-
       Binary from the specified version of a secret, whichever contains  con-
       tent.

       We  recommend  that  you  cache your secret values by using client-side
       caching. Caching secrets improves speed and  reduces  your  costs.  For
       more information, see Cache secrets for your applications .

       To  retrieve  the  previous  version  of a secret, use VersionStage and
       specify AWSPREVIOUS. To revert to the previous  version  of  a  secret,
       call UpdateSecretVersionStage .
          Required permissions:  secretsmanager:GetSecretValue . If the secret
          is encrypted using a customer-managed key instead of the Amazon  Web
          Services managed key aws/secretsmanager , then you also need kms:De-
          crypt permissions for that key. For more information, see IAM policy
          actions for Secrets Manager and Authentication and access control in
          Secrets Manager .

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or name of the secret to retrieve.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN. See Finding a secret from a partial ARN .

       --version-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier of the version of the secret to retrieve. If
          you include both this parameter and VersionStage , the  two  parame-
          ters must refer to the same secret version. If you don't specify ei-
          ther a VersionStage or VersionId , then Secrets Manager returns  the
          AWSCURRENT version.

          This  value  is typically a UUID-type value with 32 hexadecimal dig-
          its.

       --version-stage (string)
          The staging label of the version of the secret to retrieve.

          Secrets Manager uses staging labels to keep track of different  ver-
          sions  during the rotation process. If you include both this parame-
          ter and VersionId , the two parameters must refer to the same secret
          version.  If  you don't specify either a VersionStage or VersionId ,
          Secrets Manager returns the AWSCURRENT version.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To retrieve the encrypted secret value of a secret

       The following get-secret-value example gets the current secret value.

          aws secretsmanager get-secret-value \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestSecret",
              "VersionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
              "SecretString": "{\"user\":\"diegor\",\"password\":\"EXAMPLE-PASSWORD\"}",
              "VersionStages": [
                  "AWSCURRENT"
              ],
              "CreatedDate": 1523477145.713
          }

       For more information, see Retrieve a secret in the Secrets Manager User
       Guide.

       Example 2: To retrieve the previous secret value

       The following get-secret-value example gets the current secret value.:

          aws secretsmanager get-secret-value \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret
              --version-stage AWSPREVIOUS

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestSecret",
              "VersionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",
              "SecretString": "{\"user\":\"diegor\",\"password\":\"PREVIOUS-EXAMPLE-PASSWORD\"}",
              "VersionStages": [
                  "AWSPREVIOUS"
              ],
              "CreatedDate": 1523477145.713
          }

OUTPUT
       ARN -> (string)
          The ARN of the secret.

       Name -> (string)
          The friendly name of the secret.

       VersionId -> (string)
          The unique identifier of this version of the secret.

       SecretBinary -> (blob)
          The decrypted secret value, if the secret value was originally  pro-
          vided  as  binary data in the form of a byte array. The response pa-
          rameter represents the binary data as a base64-encoded string.

          If the secret was created by using the Secrets Manager  console,  or
          if  the  secret value was originally provided as a string, then this
          field is omitted. The secret value appears in SecretString instead.

       SecretString -> (string)
          The decrypted secret value, if the secret value was originally  pro-
          vided as a string or through the Secrets Manager console.

          If  this  secret was created by using the console, then Secrets Man-
          ager stores the information as a JSON structure of key/value pairs.

       VersionStages -> (list)
          A list of all of the staging labels currently attached to this  ver-
          sion of the secret.

          (string)

       CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and  time that this version of the secret was created. If
          you don't specify which version in VersionId or VersionStage ,  then
          Secrets Manager uses the AWSCURRENT version.
