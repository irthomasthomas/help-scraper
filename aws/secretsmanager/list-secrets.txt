LIST-SECRETS()                                                  LIST-SECRETS()



NAME
       list-secrets -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the secrets that are stored by Secrets Manager in the Amazon Web
       Services account, not including secrets that are marked  for  deletion.
       To see secrets marked for deletion, use the Secrets Manager console.

       ListSecrets  is  eventually  consistent,  however  it might not reflect
       changes from the last five minutes. To get the latest information for a
       specific secret, use  DescribeSecret .

       To list the versions of a secret, use  ListSecretVersionIds .

       To  get the secret value from SecretString or SecretBinary , call  Get-
       SecretValue .

       For information about finding secrets in the console, see Find  secrets
       in Secrets Manager .

       Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this ac-
       tion. Do not include sensitive information in  request  parameters  be-
       cause  it  might  be  logged. For more information, see Logging Secrets
       Manager events with CloudTrail .
          Required permissions:  secretsmanager:ListSecrets . For more  infor-
          mation,   see   IAM   policy   actions   for   Secrets  Manager  and
          Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager .

       list-secrets is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: SecretList

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters to apply to the list of secrets.

          (structure)
              Allows  you  to  add filters when you use the search function in
              Secrets Manager. For more information, see Find secrets  in  Se-
              crets Manager .

              Key -> (string)
                 The following are keys you can use:

                 o description : Prefix match, not case-sensitive.

                 o name : Prefix match, case-sensitive.

                 o tag-key : Prefix match, case-sensitive.

                 o tag-value : Prefix match, case-sensitive.

                 o primary-region : Prefix match, case-sensitive.

                 o all  :  Breaks  the filter value string into words and then
                   searches all attributes for matches. Not case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The keyword to filter for.

                 You can prefix your search value with an exclamation mark  (!
                 ) in order to perform negation filters.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "description"|"name"|"tag-key"|"tag-value"|"primary-region"|"all",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sort-order (string)
          Lists secrets in the requested order.

          Possible values:

          o asc

          o desc

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To list the secrets in your account

       Guide.

       Example 2: To filter the list of secrets in your account

       The following list-secrets example gets a list of the secrets  in  your
       account  that  have  Test in the name. Filtering by name is case sensi-
       tive.

          aws secretsmanager list-secrets \
              --filter Key="name",Values="Test"

       Output:

          {
              "SecretList": [
                  {
                      "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
                      "Name": "MyTestSecret",

       Guide.

OUTPUT
       SecretList -> (list)
          A list of the secrets in the account.

          (structure)
              A  structure  that  contains the details about a secret. It does
              not include the encrypted SecretString and SecretBinary  values.
              To get those values, use GetSecretValue .

              ARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  friendly name of the secret. You can use forward slashes
                 in the name to  represent  a  path  hierarchy.  For  example,
                 /prod/databases/dbserver1  could  represent  the secret for a
                 server named dbserver1 in the folder databases in the  folder
                 prod .

              Description -> (string)
                 The user-provided description of the secret.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of the KMS key that Secrets Manager uses to encrypt
                 the secret value. If the secret is encrypted with the  Amazon
                 Web  Services  managed key aws/secretsmanager , this field is
                 omitted.

              RotationEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether automatic, scheduled  rotation  is  enabled
                 for this secret.

              RotationLambdaARN -> (string)
                 The  ARN of an Amazon Web Services Lambda function invoked by
                 Secrets Manager to rotate and expire the secret either  auto-
                 matically  per  the  schedule  or manually by a call to ` Ro-
                 tateSecret
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/apireference/API_RotateSecret.html`__
                 .

              RotationRules -> (structure)
                 A structure that defines the rotation configuration  for  the
                 secret.

                 AutomaticallyAfterDays -> (long)
                     The  number of days between automatic scheduled rotations
                     of the secret. You can use this value to check that  your
                     secret meets your compliance guidelines for how often se-
                     crets must be rotated.

                     In DescribeSecret and ListSecrets , this value is  calcu-
                     lated  from  the rotation schedule after every successful
                     rotation. In RotateSecret ,  you  can  set  the  rotation
                     schedule  in RotationRules with AutomaticallyAfterDays or
                     ScheduleExpression , but not both.

                 Duration -> (string)
                     The length of the rotation window in hours,  for  example
                     3h  for a three hour window. Secrets Manager rotates your
                     secret at any time during this window.  The  window  must
                     not  go  into the next UTC day. If you don't specify this
                     value, the window automatically ends at the  end  of  the
                     UTC  day.  The window begins according to the ScheduleEx-
                     pression . For more information, including examples,  see
                     Schedule expressions in Secrets Manager rotation .

                 ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                     A  cron()  or rate() expression that defines the schedule
                     for rotating your secret. Secrets Manager rotation sched-
                     ules use UTC time zone.

                     Secrets Manager rate() expressions represent the interval
                     in days that you want to rotate your secret, for  example
                     rate(10 days) . If you use a rate() expression, the rota-
                     tion window opens at midnight, and  Secrets  Manager  ro-
                     tates  your  secret any time that day after midnight. You
                     can set a Duration to shorten the rotation window.

                     You can use a cron() expression to create rotation sched-
                     ules that are more detailed than a rotation interval. For
                     more information, including examples,  see  Schedule  ex-
                     pressions  in  Secrets  Manager  rotation  . If you use a
                     cron() expression, Secrets Manager  rotates  your  secret
                     any  time during that day after the window opens. For ex-
                     ample, cron(0 8 1 * ? *)  represents  a  rotation  window
                     that  occurs on the first day of every month beginning at
                     8:00 AM UTC. Secrets Manager rotates the secret any  time
                     that day after 8:00 AM. You can set a Duration to shorten
                     the rotation window.

              LastRotatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The most recent date and time that the Secrets Manager  rota-
                 tion  process  was successfully completed. This value is null
                 if the secret hasn't ever rotated.

              LastChangedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The last date and time that this secret was modified  in  any
                 way.

              LastAccessedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  that  the  secret was last accessed in the Region.
                 This field is omitted if the secret has never been  retrieved
                 in the Region.

              DeletedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time the deletion of the secret occurred. Not
                 present on active secrets. The secret can be recovered  until
                 the  number  of  days  in  the recovery window has passed, as
                 specified in the  RecoveryWindowInDays  parameter  of  the  `
                 DeleteSecret
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/apireference/API_DeleteSecret.html`__
                 operation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The  list of user-defined tags associated with the secret. To
                 add    tags    to    a    secret,    use    `     TagResource
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/apireference/API_TagResource.html`__
                 .     To     remove     tags,     use     `     UntagResource
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/apireference/API_UntagResource.html`__
                 .

                 (structure)
                     A structure that contains information about a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The string value associated with the key of the tag.

              SecretVersionsToStages -> (map)
                 A list of all of the  currently  assigned  SecretVersionStage
                 staging  labels and the SecretVersionId attached to each one.
                 Staging labels are used to keep track of the  different  ver-

       NextToken -> (string)
          Secrets Manager includes this value if there's more output available
          than what is included in the current response. This can  occur  even
          when  the  response  includes no values at all, such as when you ask
          for a filtered view of a long list. To get the  next  results,  call
          ListSecrets again with this value.
