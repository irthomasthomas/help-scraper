CANCEL-ROTATE-SECRET()                                  CANCEL-ROTATE-SECRET()



NAME
       cancel-rotate-secret -

DESCRIPTION
       Turns  off  automatic  rotation,  and  if  a  rotation  is currently in
       progress, cancels the rotation.

       If you cancel a rotation in progress, it can leave the VersionStage la-
       bels in an unexpected state. You might need to remove the staging label
       AWSPENDING from the partially created version. You also need to  deter-
       mine whether to roll back to the previous version of the secret by mov-
       ing the staging label AWSCURRENT to the version that has  AWSPENDING  .
       To  determine which version has a specific staging label, call  ListSe-
       cretVersionIds . Then use  UpdateSecretVersionStage to  change  staging
       labels. For more information, see How rotation works .

       To turn on automatic rotation again, call  RotateSecret .

       Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this ac-
       tion. Do not include sensitive information in  request  parameters  be-
       cause  it  might  be  logged. For more information, see Logging Secrets
       Manager events with CloudTrail .
          Required permissions:  secretsmanager:CancelRotateSecret . For  more
          information,   see  IAM  policy  actions  for  Secrets  Manager  and
          Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager .

SYNOPSIS
            cancel-rotate-secret
          --secret-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or name of the secret.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN. See Finding a secret from a partial ARN .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To turn off automatic rotation for a secret

       The following cancel-rotate-secret example turns off automatic rotation
       for a secret. To resume rotation, call rotate-secret.

          aws secretsmanager cancel-rotate-secret \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret

       Output:

          {
            "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
            "Name": "MyTestSecret"
          }

       For more information, see Rotate a secret in the Secrets  Manager  User
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       ARN -> (string)
          The ARN of the secret.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the secret.

       VersionId -> (string)
          The  unique  identifier  of the version of the secret created during
          the rotation. This version might not  be  complete,  and  should  be
          evaluated  for  possible  deletion. We recommend that you remove the
          VersionStage value AWSPENDING from this version so that Secrets Man-
          ager  can  delete  it.  Failing to clean up a cancelled rotation can
          block you from starting future rotations.
