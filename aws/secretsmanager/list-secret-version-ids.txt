LIST-SECRET-VERSION-IDS()                            LIST-SECRET-VERSION-IDS()



NAME
       list-secret-version-ids -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the versions of a secret. Secrets Manager uses staging labels to
       indicate the different versions of a secret. For more information,  see
       Secrets Manager concepts: Versions .

       To list the secrets in the account, use  ListSecrets .

       Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this ac-
       tion. Do not include sensitive information in  request  parameters  be-
       cause  it  might  be  logged. For more information, see Logging Secrets
       Manager events with CloudTrail .
          Required  permissions:   secretsmanager:ListSecretVersionIds  .  For
          more  information,  see  IAM  policy actions for Secrets Manager and
          Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager .

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or name of the secret whose versions you want to list.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN. See Finding a secret from a partial ARN .

       --max-results (integer)
          The number of results to include in the response.

          If  there  are more results available, in the response, Secrets Man-
          ager includes NextToken . To get  the  next  results,  call  ListSe-
          cretVersionIds again with the value from NextToken .

       --next-token (string)
          A  token  that indicates where the output should continue from, if a
          previous call did not show all results. To  get  the  next  results,
          call ListSecretVersionIds again with this value.

       --include-deprecated | --no-include-deprecated (boolean)
          Specifies whether to include versions of secrets that don't have any
          staging labels attached to them. Versions without staging labels are
          considered  deprecated  and  are subject to deletion by Secrets Man-
          ager. By default, versions without staging labels aren't included.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list all of the secret versions associated with a secret

       The following list-secret-version-ids example gets a list of all of the
       versions of a secret.

          aws secretsmanager list-secret-version-ids \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret

              LastAccessedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  that this version of the secret was last accessed.
                 Note that the resolution of this field is at the  date  level
                 and does not include the time.

          ListSecretVersionIds again with this value.

       ARN -> (string)
