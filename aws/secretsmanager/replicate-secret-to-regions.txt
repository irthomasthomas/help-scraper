NAME
       replicate-secret-to-regions -

DESCRIPTION
       Replicates the secret to a new Regions. See Multi-Region secrets .

       Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this ac-
       tion. Do not include sensitive information in  request  parameters  be-
       cause  it  might  be  logged. For more information, see Logging Secrets
       Manager events with CloudTrail .
          Required permissions:  secretsmanager:ReplicateSecretToRegions . For
          more  information,  see  IAM  policy actions for Secrets Manager and
          Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager .

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or name of the secret to replicate.

       --add-replica-regions (list)
          A list of Regions in which to replicate the secret.

          (structure)
              A custom type that specifies a Region and  the  KmsKeyId  for  a
              replica secret.

              Region -> (string)
                 A  Region code. For a list of Region codes, see Name and code
                 of Regions .

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The ARN, key ID, or alias of the KMS key to encrypt  the  se-
                 cret.  If  you don't include this field, Secrets Manager uses
                 aws/secretsmanager .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Region=string,KmsKeyId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Region": "string",
              "KmsKeyId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --force-overwrite-replica-secret |  --no-force-overwrite-replica-secret
       (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  to  overwrite a secret with the same name in the
          destination Region. By default, secrets aren't overwritten.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To replicate a secret to another region

       The following replicate-secret-to-regions example replicates  a  secret
       to eu-west-3. The replica is encrypted with the AWS managed key aws/se-
       cretsmanager.

          aws secretsmanager replicate-secret-to-regions \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret \
              --add-replica-regions Region=eu-west-3

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-1a2b3c",
              "ReplicationStatus": [
                  {
                      "Region": "eu-west-3",
                      "KmsKeyId": "alias/aws/secretsmanager",
                      "Status": "InProgress"
                  }
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Replicate a secret to another Region  in  the
       Secrets Manager User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ARN -> (string)

              ject and includes a Region, KMSKeyId, status,  and  status  mes-
              sage.

              Region -> (string)
                 The Region where replication occurs.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
