SYNOPSIS
            replicate-secret-to-regions
          --secret-id <value>
          --add-replica-regions <value>
          [--force-overwrite-replica-secret | --no-force-overwrite-replica-secret]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or name of the secret to replicate.

       --add-replica-regions (list)
          A list of Regions in which to replicate the secret.

          (structure)
              A  custom  type  that  specifies a Region and the KmsKeyId for a
              replica secret.

              Region -> (string)
                 A Region code. For a list of Region codes, see Name and  code
                 of Regions .

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The  ARN,  key ID, or alias of the KMS key to encrypt the se-
                 cret. If you don't include this field, Secrets  Manager  uses
                 aws/secretsmanager .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Region=string,KmsKeyId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Region": "string",
              "KmsKeyId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --force-overwrite-replica-secret  | --no-force-overwrite-replica-secret
       (boolean)
          Specifies whether to overwrite a secret with the same  name  in  the
          destination Region.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To replicate a secret to another region

       The  following  replicate-secret-to-regions example replicates a secret
       to eu-west-3. The replica is encrypted with the AWS managed key aws/se-
       cretsmanager.

          aws secretsmanager replicate-secret-to-regions \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret \
              --add-replica-regions Region=eu-west-3

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-1a2b3c",
              "ReplicationStatus": [
                  {
                      "Region": "eu-west-3",
                      "KmsKeyId": "alias/aws/secretsmanager",
                      "Status": "InProgress"
                  }
              ]
          }

       For  more  information, see Replicate a secret to another Region in the
       Secrets Manager User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ARN -> (string)
          The ARN of the primary secret.

       ReplicationStatus -> (list)
          The status of replication.

          (structure)
              A replication object consisting of a RegionReplicationStatus ob-
              ject  and  includes  a Region, KMSKeyId, status, and status mes-
              sage.

              Region -> (string)
                 The Region where replication occurs.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 Can be an ARN , Key ID , or Alias .

              Status -> (string)
                 The status can be InProgress , Failed , or InSync .

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 Status message such as "Secret with this name already  exists
                 in this region ".

              LastAccessedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  that  the  secret was last accessed in the Region.
                 This field is omitted if the secret has never been  retrieved
                 in the Region.
