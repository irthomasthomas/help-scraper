PUT-SECRET-VALUE()                                          PUT-SECRET-VALUE()



NAME
       put-secret-value -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new version with a new encrypted secret value and attaches it
       to the secret. The version can contain a new SecretString  value  or  a
       new SecretBinary value.

       We  recommend  you  avoid calling PutSecretValue at a sustained rate of
       more than once every 10 minutes. When you update the secret value,  Se-
       crets  Manager creates a new version of the secret. Secrets Manager re-
       moves outdated versions when there are more than 100, but it  does  not
       remove  versions created less than 24 hours ago. If you call PutSecret-
       Value more than once every 10 minutes, you create  more  versions  than
       Secrets  Manager  removes, and you will reach the quota for secret ver-
       sions.

       You can specify the staging labels to attach to the new version in Ver-
       sionStages  . If you don't include VersionStages , then Secrets Manager
       automatically moves the staging label AWSCURRENT to  this  version.  If
       this  operation  creates the first version for the secret, then Secrets
       Manager automatically attaches the staging label AWSCURRENT to  it.  If
       this  operation moves the staging label AWSCURRENT from another version
       to this version, then Secrets  Manager  also  automatically  moves  the
       staging  label  AWSPREVIOUS  to the version that AWSCURRENT was removed
       from.

       This operation is idempotent. If you call this operation with a  Clien-
       tRequestToken  that  matches  an  existing version's VersionId, and you
       specify the same secret data, the operation succeeds but does  nothing.
       However,  if the secret data is different, then the operation fails be-
       cause you can't modify an existing version; you  can  only  create  new
       ones.

       Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this ac-
       tion. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters except
       SecretBinary  ,  SecretString  ,  or  RotationToken because it might be
       logged. For more information, see Logging Secrets Manager  events  with
       CloudTrail .
          Required  permissions:  secretsmanager:PutSecretValue . For more in-
          formation,  see  IAM  policy  actions  for   Secrets   Manager   and
          Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager .

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or name of the secret to add a new version to.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN. See Finding a secret from a partial ARN .

          If the secret doesn't already exist, use CreateSecret instead.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique identifier for the new version of the secret.

          NOTE:
              If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon  Web
              Services  SDKs  to  call this operation, then you can leave this
              parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for  you
              and includes it as the value for this parameter in the request.

          If  you  generate  a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service
          endpoint, then you must generate a ClientRequestToken and include it
          in the request.

          This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value
          to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate  versions  if  there
          are  failures  and  retries during a rotation. We recommend that you
          generate a UUID-type value to ensure  uniqueness  of  your  versions
          within the specified secret.

          o If  the  ClientRequestToken  value isn't already associated with a
            version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.

          o If a version with this value already exists and that version's Se-
            cretString or SecretBinary values are the same as those in the re-
            quest then the request is ignored. The operation is idempotent.

          o If a version with this value already exists and the version of the
            SecretString  and  SecretBinary values are different from those in
            the request, then the request fails because you can't modify a se-
            cret version. You can only create new versions to store new secret
            values.

          This value becomes the VersionId of the new version.

       --secret-binary (blob)
          The binary data to encrypt and store in the new version of  the  se-
          cret.  To use this parameter in the command-line tools, we recommend
          that you store your binary data in a file and then pass the contents
          of the file as a parameter.

          You must include SecretBinary or SecretString , but not both.

          You can't access this value from the Secrets Manager console.

          Sensitive: This field contains sensitive information, so the service
          does not include it in CloudTrail log entries. If  you  create  your
          own log entries, you must also avoid logging the information in this
          field.

       --secret-string (string)
          The text to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret.

          You must include SecretBinary or SecretString , but not both.

          We recommend you create the secret string as JSON  key/value  pairs,
          as shown in the example.

          Sensitive: This field contains sensitive information, so the service
          does not include it in CloudTrail log entries. If  you  create  your
          own log entries, you must also avoid logging the information in this
          field.

       --version-stages (list)
          A list of staging labels to attach to this version  of  the  secret.
          Secrets  Manager  uses  staging labels to track versions of a secret
          through the rotation process.

          If you specify a staging label that's already associated with a dif-
          ferent  version of the same secret, then Secrets Manager removes the
          label from the other version and attaches it to this version. If you
          specify  AWSCURRENT , and it is already attached to another version,
          then Secrets Manager also moves the staging label AWSPREVIOUS to the
          version that AWSCURRENT was removed from.

          If  you don't include VersionStages , then Secrets Manager automati-
          cally moves the staging label AWSCURRENT to this version.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --rotation-token (string)
          A unique identifier that indicates the source of  the  request.  For
          cross-account  rotation  (when you rotate a secret in one account by
          using a Lambda rotation function in another account) and the  Lambda
          rotation  function  assumes an IAM role to call Secrets Manager, Se-
          crets Manager validates the identity with the  rotation  token.  For
          more information, see How rotation works .

          Sensitive: This field contains sensitive information, so the service
          does not include it in CloudTrail log entries. If  you  create  your
          own log entries, you must also avoid logging the information in this
          field.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To store a new secret value in a secret

       The  following  put-secret-value example creates a new version of a se-
       cret with two key-value pairs.

          aws secretsmanager put-secret-value \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret \
              --secret-string "{\"user\":\"diegor\",\"password\":\"EXAMPLE-PASSWORD\"}"

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-1a2b3c",
              "Name": "MyTestSecret",
              "VersionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
              "VersionStages": [
                  "AWSCURRENT"
              ]
          }

       Guide.

       Example 2: To store a new secret value from credentials in a JSON file

       The  following  put-secret-value example creates a new version of a se-
       cret from credentials in a file. For more information, see Loading  AWS
       CLI parameters from a file in the AWS CLI User Guide.

          aws secretsmanager put-secret-value \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret \
              --secret-string file://mycreds.json
