GET-RESOURCE-POLICY()                                    GET-RESOURCE-POLICY()



NAME
       get-resource-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the JSON text of the resource-based policy document attached
       to the secret. For more information about permissions policies attached
       to a secret, see Permissions policies attached to a secret .

       Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this ac-
       tion. Do not include sensitive information in  request  parameters  be-
       cause  it  might  be  logged. For more information, see Logging Secrets
       Manager events with CloudTrail .
          Required permissions:  secretsmanager:GetResourcePolicy .  For  more
          information,   see  IAM  policy  actions  for  Secrets  Manager  and
          Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager .

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN  or  name  of  the  secret  to  retrieve  the  attached  re-
          source-based policy for.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN. See Finding a secret from a partial ARN .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve the resource-based policy attached to a secret

       The  following get-resource-policy example retrieves the resource-based
       policy attached to a secret.

          aws secretsmanager get-resource-policy \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestSecret",
              "ResourcePolicy": "{\n\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\n\"Statement\":[{\n\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\n
              \"Principal\":{\n\"AWS\":\"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root\"\n},\n\"Action\":
              \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\",\n\"Resource\":\"*\"\n}]\n}"
          }

       crets Manager User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ARN -> (string)

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the secret that the resource-based policy was  retrieved
          for.

       ResourcePolicy -> (string)
          A  JSON-formatted  string  that  contains the permissions policy at-
          tached to the secret. For more information about  permissions  poli-
          cies, see Authentication and access control for Secrets Manager .
