VALIDATE-RESOURCE-POLICY()                          VALIDATE-RESOURCE-POLICY()



NAME
       validate-resource-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Validates that a resource policy does not grant a wide range of princi-
       pals access to your secret. A resource-based policy is optional for se-
       crets.

       The API performs three checks when validating the policy:

       o Sends  a  call  to Zelkova , an automated reasoning engine, to ensure
         your resource policy does not allow broad access to your secret,  for
         example policies that use a wildcard for the principal.

       o Checks for correct syntax in a policy.

       o Verifies the policy does not lock out a caller.

       Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this ac-
       tion. Do not include sensitive information in  request  parameters  be-
       cause  it  might  be  logged. For more information, see Logging Secrets
       Manager events with CloudTrail .
          Required permissions:  secretsmanager:ValidateResourcePolicy and se-
          cretsmanager:PutResourcePolicy  . For more information, see IAM pol-
          icy actions for Secrets Manager and Authentication and  access  con-
          trol in Secrets Manager .

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The  ARN  or  name  of the secret with the resource-based policy you
          want to validate.

       --resource-policy (string)
          A JSON-formatted string that contains an  Amazon  Web  Services  re-
          source-based policy. The policy in the string identifies who can ac-
          cess or manage this secret and its versions. For  example  policies,
          see Permissions policy examples .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To validate a resource policy

       The  following  validate-resource-policy example checks that a resource
       policy doesn't grant broad access to a secret. The policy is read  from
       a  file  on  disk. For more information, see Loading AWS CLI parameters
       from a file in the AWS CLI User Guide.

          aws secretsmanager validate-resource-policy \
              --resource-policy file://mypolicy.json

       Contents of mypolicy.json:

          {
              "Version": "2012-10-17",
              "Statement": [
                  {

                      "Action": "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
                      "Resource": "*"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Output:

          {
              "PolicyValidationPassed": true,
              "ValidationErrors": []
          }

          (structure)
              Displays  errors that occurred during validation of the resource
              policy.
