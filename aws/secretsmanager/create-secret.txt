CREATE-SECRET()                                                CREATE-SECRET()



NAME
       create-secret -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new secret. A secret can be a password, a set of credentials
       such as a user name and password, an OAuth token, or other  secret  in-
       formation  that  you store in an encrypted form in Secrets Manager. The
       secret also includes the connection information to access a database or
       other  service,  which Secrets Manager doesn't encrypt. A secret in Se-
       crets Manager consists of both the protected secret data and the impor-
       tant information needed to manage the secret.

       For  information  about  creating a secret in the console, see Create a
       secret .

       To create a secret, you can provide the secret value to be encrypted in
       either  the  SecretString  parameter or the SecretBinary parameter, but
       not both. If you include SecretString or SecretBinary then Secrets Man-
       ager  creates  an initial secret version and automatically attaches the
       staging label AWSCURRENT to it.

       For database credentials you want to rotate, for Secrets Manager to  be
       able to rotate the secret, you must make sure the JSON you store in the
       SecretString matches the JSON structure of a database secret .

       If you don't specify an KMS encryption key, Secrets  Manager  uses  the
       Amazon  Web  Services  managed  key  aws/secretsmanager  .  If this key
       doesn't already exist in your account, then Secrets Manager creates  it
       for  you  automatically. All users and roles in the Amazon Web Services
       account automatically have access to use aws/secretsmanager .  Creating
       aws/secretsmanager  can  result  in a one-time significant delay in re-
       turning the result.

       If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services  account  from  the
       credentials  calling  the API, then you can't use aws/secretsmanager to
       encrypt the secret, and you must create and use a customer managed  KMS
       key.
          Required  permissions:  secretsmanager:CreateSecret . If you include
          tags in the secret, you also need secretsmanager:TagResource  .  For
          more  information,  see  IAM  policy actions for Secrets Manager and
          Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager .

       To encrypt the secret with a KMS key other  than  aws/secretsmanager  ,
       you need kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permission to the key.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the new secret.

          The  secret name can contain ASCII letters, numbers, and the follow-
          ing characters: /_+=.@-

          Do not end your secret name with a hyphen followed  by  six  charac-
          ters.  If  you do so, you risk confusion and unexpected results when
          searching for a secret by partial ARN. Secrets Manager automatically
          adds a hyphen and six random characters after the secret name at the
          end of the ARN.

       --client-request-token (string)
          If you include SecretString or SecretBinary , then  Secrets  Manager
          creates an initial version for the secret, and this parameter speci-
          fies the unique identifier for the new version.

          NOTE:
              If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon  Web
              Services  SDKs  to  call this operation, then you can leave this
              parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for  you
              and  includes it as the value for this parameter in the request.
              If you don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request
              to  the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate
              a ClientRequestToken yourself for the new  version  and  include
              the value in the request.

          This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value
          to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate  versions  if  there
          are  failures  and  retries during a rotation. We recommend that you
          generate a UUID-type value to ensure  uniqueness  of  your  versions
          within the specified secret.

          o If  the  ClientRequestToken  value isn't already associated with a
            version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.

          o If a version with this value already exists and  the  version  Se-
            cretString  and  SecretBinary  values are the same as those in the
            request, then the request is ignored.

          o If a version with this value already exists and that version's Se-
            cretString and SecretBinary values are different from those in the
            request, then the request fails because you cannot modify  an  ex-
            isting  version. Instead, use  PutSecretValue to create a new ver-
            sion.

          This value becomes the VersionId of the new version.

       --description (string)
          The description of the secret.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The ARN, key ID, or alias of the KMS key that Secrets  Manager  uses
          to  encrypt  the secret value in the secret. An alias is always pre-
          fixed by alias/ , for example alias/aws/secretsmanager  .  For  more
          information, see About aliases .

          To  use  a  KMS  key  in a different account, use the key ARN or the
          alias ARN.

          If you don't specify this value, then Secrets Manager uses  the  key
          aws/secretsmanager  .  If  that  key doesn't yet exist, then Secrets
          Manager creates it for you automatically the first time it  encrypts
          the secret value.

          If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account from the
          credentials calling the API, then you can't  use  aws/secretsmanager
          to  encrypt  the secret, and you must create and use a customer man-
          aged KMS key.

       --secret-binary (blob)
          The binary data to encrypt and store in the new version of  the  se-
          cret.  We  recommend  that  you store your binary data in a file and
          then pass the contents of the file as a parameter.

          Either SecretString or SecretBinary must have a value, but not both.

          This parameter is not available in the Secrets Manager console.

       --secret-string (string)
          The text data to encrypt and store in this new version  of  the  se-
          cret.  We  recommend you use a JSON structure of key/value pairs for
          your secret value.

          Either SecretString or SecretBinary must have a value, but not both.

          If you create a secret by using the Secrets Manager console then Se-
          crets  Manager  puts  the  protected secret text in only the Secret-
          String parameter. The Secrets Manager console stores the information
          as  a JSON structure of key/value pairs that a Lambda rotation func-
          tion can parse.

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags to attach to the secret. Each tag is a key and  value
          pair of strings in a JSON text string, for example:
              [{"Key":"CostCenter","Value":"12345"},{"Key":"environ-
              ment","Value":"production"}]

          Secrets Manager tag key names are case sensitive. A tag with the key
          "ABC" is a different tag from one with key "abc".

          If  you  check tags in permissions policies as part of your security
          strategy, then adding or removing a tag can change  permissions.  If
          the  completion  of  this  operation would result in you losing your
          permissions for this secret, then Secrets Manager blocks the  opera-
          tion  and  returns an Access Denied error. For more information, see
          Control access to secrets using tags and Limit access to  identities
          with tags that match secrets' tags .

          For information about how to format a JSON parameter for the various
          command line tool environments, see Using JSON for Parameters  .  If
          your  command-line  tool  or SDK requires quotation marks around the
          parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with  the
          double quotes required in the JSON text.

          The following restrictions apply to tags:

          o Maximum number of tags per secret: 50

          o Maximum key length: 127 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o Maximum value length: 255 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

          o Do  not  use  the  aws: prefix in your tag names or values because
            Amazon Web Services reserves it for Amazon Web Services  use.  You
            can't  edit  or  delete tag names or values with this prefix. Tags
            with this prefix do not count against your tags per secret limit.

          o If you use your tagging schema across multiple  services  and  re-
            sources, other services might have restrictions on allowed charac-
            ters. Generally allowed characters: letters, spaces,  and  numbers
            representable in UTF-8, plus the following special characters: + -
            = . _ : / @.

          (structure)
              A structure that contains information about a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The string value associated with the key of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --add-replica-regions (list)
          A list of Regions and KMS keys to replicate secrets.

          (structure)
              A custom type that specifies a Region and  the  KmsKeyId  for  a
              replica secret.

              Region -> (string)
                 A  Region code. For a list of Region codes, see Name and code
                 of Regions .

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The ARN, key ID, or alias of the KMS key to encrypt  the  se-
                 cret.  If  you don't include this field, Secrets Manager uses
                 aws/secretsmanager .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Region=string,KmsKeyId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Region": "string",
              "KmsKeyId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --force-overwrite-replica-secret |  --no-force-overwrite-replica-secret
       (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  to  overwrite a secret with the same name in the
          destination Region.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create a secret

       The following create-secret example creates a secret with two key-value
       pairs.

          aws secretsmanager create-secret \
              --name MyTestSecret \
              --description "My test secret created with the CLI." \
              --secret-string "{\"user\":\"diegor\",\"password\":\"EXAMPLE-PASSWORD\"}"

       Output:

          {
            "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
            "Name": "MyTestSecret",
            "VersionId": "EXAMPLE1-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987EXAMPLE"
          }

       For  more  information, see Create a secret in the Secrets Manager User
       Guide.

       Example 2: To create a secret from credentials in a JSON file

       The following create-secret example creates a secret  from  credentials
       in  a file. For more information, see Loading AWS CLI parameters from a
       file in the AWS CLI User Guide.

          aws secretsmanager create-secret \
              --name MyTestSecret \
              --secret-string file://mycreds.json

       Contents of mycreds.json:

          {
            "engine": "mysql",
            "username": "saanvis",
            "password": "EXAMPLE-PASSWORD",
            "host": "my-database-endpoint.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com",
            "dbname": "myDatabase",
            "port": "3306"
          }

       Output:

          {
            "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
            "Name": "MyTestSecret",
            "VersionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
          }

       For more information, see Create a secret in the Secrets  Manager  User
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       ARN -> (string)
          The  ARN  of the new secret. The ARN includes the name of the secret
          followed by six random characters. This ensures that if you create a
          new  secret  with the same name as a deleted secret, then users with
          access to the old secret don't get access to the new secret  because
          the ARNs are different.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the new secret.

       VersionId -> (string)
          The unique identifier associated with the version of the new secret.

       ReplicationStatus -> (list)
          A list of the replicas of this secret and their status:

          o Failed , which indicates that the replica was not created.

          o InProgress  ,  which  indicates  that  Secrets  Manager  is in the
            process of creating the replica.

          o InSync , which indicates that the replica was created.

          (structure)
              A replication object consisting of a RegionReplicationStatus ob-
              ject  and  includes  a Region, KMSKeyId, status, and status mes-
              sage.

              Region -> (string)
                 The Region where replication occurs.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 Can be an ARN , Key ID , or Alias .

              Status -> (string)
                 The status can be InProgress , Failed , or InSync .

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 Status message such as "Secret with this name already  exists
                 in this region ".

              LastAccessedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  that  the  secret was last accessed in the Region.
                 This field is omitted if the secret has never been  retrieved
                 in the Region.
