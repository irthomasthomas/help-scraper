UPDATE-SECRET()                                                UPDATE-SECRET()



NAME
       update-secret -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  the  details  of  a secret, including metadata and the secret
       value. To change the secret value, you can also use  PutSecretValue .

       To change the rotation configuration of a secret, use  RotateSecret in-
       stead.

       We recommend you avoid calling UpdateSecret at a sustained rate of more
       than once every 10 minutes. When you call UpdateSecret  to  update  the
       secret  value, Secrets Manager creates a new version of the secret. Se-
       crets Manager removes outdated versions when there are more  than  100,
       but  it does not remove versions created less than 24 hours ago. If you
       update the secret value more than once every  10  minutes,  you  create
       more  versions  than  Secrets  Manager  removes, and you will reach the
       quota for secret versions.

       If you include SecretString or SecretBinary to create a new secret ver-
       sion,  Secrets Manager automatically moves the staging label AWSCURRENT
       to the new version. Then it attaches the label AWSPREVIOUS to the  ver-
       sion that AWSCURRENT was removed from.

       If  you  call  this operation with a ClientRequestToken that matches an
       existing version's VersionId , the operation results in an  error.  You
       can't modify an existing version, you can only create a new version. To
       remove a version, remove all staging labels  from  it.  See   UpdateSe-
       cretVersionStage .

       Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this ac-
       tion. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters except
       SecretBinary  or  SecretString because it might be logged. For more in-
       formation, see Logging Secrets Manager events with CloudTrail .
          Required permissions:  secretsmanager:UpdateSecret . For more infor-
          mation,   see   IAM   policy   actions   for   Secrets  Manager  and
          Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager . If you use  a
          customer  managed  key,  you  must also have kms:GenerateDataKey and
          kms:Decrypt permissions on the key. For more information, see Secret
          encryption and decryption .

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or name of the secret.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN. See Finding a secret from a partial ARN .

       --client-request-token (string)
          If you include SecretString or SecretBinary , then  Secrets  Manager
          creates  a  new version for the secret, and this parameter specifies
          the unique identifier for the new version.

          NOTE:
              If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon  Web
              Services  SDKs  to  call this operation, then you can leave this
              parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for  you
              and  includes it as the value for this parameter in the request.
              If you don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request
              to  the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate
              a ClientRequestToken yourself for the new  version  and  include
              the value in the request.

          This value becomes the VersionId of the new version.

       --description (string)
          The description of the secret.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The  ARN,  key ID, or alias of the KMS key that Secrets Manager uses
          to encrypt new secret versions as well as any existing versions with
          the  staging  labels  AWSCURRENT , AWSPENDING , or AWSPREVIOUS . For
          more information about versions and staging  labels,  see  Concepts:
          Version .

          A key alias is always prefixed by alias/ , for example alias/aws/se-
          cretsmanager . For more information, see About aliases .

          If you set this to an empty string, Secrets Manager uses the  Amazon
          Web  Services  managed  key aws/secretsmanager . If this key doesn't
          already exist in your account, then Secrets Manager creates  it  for
          you  automatically.  All  users and roles in the Amazon Web Services
          account automatically have access to use aws/secretsmanager . Creat-
          ing aws/secretsmanager can result in a one-time significant delay in
          returning the result.

          WARNING:
              You can only use the Amazon Web  Services  managed  key  aws/se-
              cretsmanager  if  you call this operation using credentials from
              the same Amazon Web Services account that owns  the  secret.  If
              the  secret  is in a different account, then you must use a cus-
              tomer managed key and provide the ARN of that KMS  key  in  this
              field.  The  user  making the call must have permissions to both
              the secret and the KMS key in their respective accounts.

       --secret-binary (blob)
          The binary data to encrypt and store in the new version of  the  se-
          cret.  We  recommend  that  you store your binary data in a file and
          then pass the contents of the file as a parameter.

          Either SecretBinary or SecretString must have a value, but not both.

          You can't access this parameter in the Secrets Manager console.

       --secret-string (string)
          The text data to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret.
          We  recommend  you  use a JSON structure of key/value pairs for your
          secret value.

          Either SecretBinary or SecretString must have a value, but not both.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To update the description of a secret

       The following update-secret example updates the description  of  a  se-
       cret.

          aws secretsmanager update-secret \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret \
              --description "This is a new description for the secret."

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestSecret"
          }

       For  more  information, see Modify a secret in the Secrets Manager User
       Guide.

       Example 2: To update the encryption key associated with a secret

       The following update-secret example updates the KMS key used to encrypt
       the secret value. The KMS key must be in the same region as the secret.

          aws secretsmanager update-secret \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret \
              --kms-key-id arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/EXAMPLE1-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987EXAMPLE
