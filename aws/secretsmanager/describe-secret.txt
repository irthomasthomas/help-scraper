DESCRIBE-SECRET()                                            DESCRIBE-SECRET()



NAME
       describe-secret -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  details  of a secret. It does not include the encrypted
       secret value. Secrets Manager only returns fields that have a value  in
       the response.
          Required  permissions:  secretsmanager:DescribeSecret . For more in-
          formation,  see  IAM  policy  actions  for   Secrets   Manager   and
          Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-secret
          --secret-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or name of the secret.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN. See Finding a secret from a partial ARN .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       ARN -> (string)
          The ARN of the secret.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the secret.

       Description -> (string)
          The description of the secret.

       KmsKeyId -> (string)
          The key ID or alias ARN of the KMS key that Secrets Manager uses  to
          encrypt the secret value. If the secret is encrypted with the Amazon
          Web Services managed key aws/secretsmanager , this field is omitted.
          Secrets created using the console use an KMS key ID.

       RotationEnabled -> (boolean)
          Specifies whether automatic rotation is turned on for this secret.

          To  turn  on rotation, use  RotateSecret . To turn off rotation, use
          CancelRotateSecret .

       RotationLambdaARN -> (string)
          The ARN of the Lambda function that Secrets Manager invokes  to  ro-
          tate the secret.

       RotationRules -> (structure)
          The  rotation  schedule  and Lambda function for this secret. If the
          secret previously had rotation turned on, but it is now turned  off,
          this  field  shows the previous rotation schedule and rotation func-
          tion. If the secret never had rotation  turned  on,  this  field  is
          omitted.

          AutomaticallyAfterDays -> (long)
              The  number of days between automatic scheduled rotations of the
              secret. You can use this value to check that your  secret  meets
              your  compliance  guidelines  for  how often secrets must be ro-
              tated.

              In DescribeSecret and ListSecrets ,  this  value  is  calculated
              from  the  rotation schedule after every successful rotation. In
              RotateSecret , you can set the rotation  schedule  in  Rotation-
              Rules  with  AutomaticallyAfterDays  or ScheduleExpression , but
              not both.

          Duration -> (string)
              The length of the rotation window in hours, for example 3h for a
              three  hour  window.  Secrets Manager rotates your secret at any
              time during this window. The window must not go  into  the  next
              UTC  day.  If you don't specify this value, the window automati-
              cally ends at the end of the UTC day. The window begins  accord-
              ing  to the ScheduleExpression . For more information, including
              examples, see Schedule expressions in Secrets Manager rotation .

          ScheduleExpression -> (string)
              A cron() or rate() expression that defines the schedule for  ro-
              tating  your  secret. Secrets Manager rotation schedules use UTC
              time zone.

              Secrets Manager rate() expressions  represent  the  interval  in
              days  that  you  want to rotate your secret, for example rate(10
              days) . If you use a  rate()  expression,  the  rotation  window
              opens  at  midnight, and Secrets Manager rotates your secret any
              time that day after midnight. You can set a Duration to  shorten
              the rotation window.

              You  can  use  a  cron() expression to create rotation schedules
              that are more detailed than a rotation interval. For more infor-
              mation,  including examples, see Schedule expressions in Secrets
              Manager rotation . If you use a cron() expression, Secrets  Man-
              ager rotates your secret any time during that day after the win-
              dow opens. For example, cron(0 8 1 * ? *) represents a  rotation
              window  that occurs on the first day of every month beginning at
              8:00 AM UTC. Secrets Manager rotates the secret  any  time  that
              day  after  8:00 AM. You can set a Duration to shorten the rota-
              tion window.

       LastRotatedDate -> (timestamp)
          The last date and time that Secrets Manager rotated the  secret.  If
          the  secret  isn't  configured for rotation, Secrets Manager returns
          null.

       LastChangedDate -> (timestamp)
          The last date and time that this secret was modified in any way.

       LastAccessedDate -> (timestamp)
          The date that the secret was last accessed in the Region. This field
          is omitted if the secret has never been retrieved in the Region.

       DeletedDate -> (timestamp)
          The  date  the secret is scheduled for deletion. If it is not sched-
          uled for deletion, this field is omitted. When you delete a  secret,
          Secrets Manager requires a recovery window of at least 7 days before
          deleting the secret. Some time after the deleted date, Secrets  Man-
          ager deletes the secret, including all of its versions.

          If  a  secret is scheduled for deletion, then its details, including
          the encrypted secret value, is not accessible. To cancel a scheduled
          deletion and restore access to the secret, use  RestoreSecret .

       Tags -> (list)
          The  list  of  tags attached to the secret. To add tags to a secret,
          use  TagResource . To remove tags, use  UntagResource .

          (structure)
              A structure that contains information about a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The string value associated with the key of the tag.

       VersionIdsToStages -> (map)
          A list of the versions of the secret that have  staging  labels  at-
          tached.  Versions that don't have staging labels are considered dep-
          recated and Secrets Manager can delete them.

          Secrets Manager uses staging labels to indicate the status of a  se-
          cret  version during rotation. The three staging labels for rotation
          are:

          o AWSCURRENT , which indicates the current version of the secret.

          o AWSPENDING , which indicates the version of the secret  that  con-
            tains  new  secret  information  that will become the next current
            version when rotation finishes. During rotation,  Secrets  Manager
            creates  an  AWSPENDING  version ID before creating the new secret
            version. To check if a secret version exists, call  GetSecretValue
            .

          o AWSPREVIOUS  , which indicates the previous current version of the
            secret. You can use this as the last known good version.

          For more information about rotation and staging labels, see How  ro-
          tation works .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       OwningService -> (string)
          The  ID  of  the service that created this secret. For more informa-
          tion, see Secrets managed by other Amazon Web Services services .

       CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the secret was created.

       PrimaryRegion -> (string)
          The Region the secret is in. If a secret is replicated to other  Re-
          gions, the replicas are listed in ReplicationStatus .

       ReplicationStatus -> (list)
          A list of the replicas of this secret and their status:

          o Failed , which indicates that the replica was not created.

          o InProgress  ,  which  indicates  that  Secrets  Manager  is in the
            process of creating the replica.

          o InSync , which indicates that the replica was created.

          (structure)
              A replication object consisting of a RegionReplicationStatus ob-
              ject  and  includes  a Region, KMSKeyId, status, and status mes-
              sage.

              Region -> (string)
                 The Region where replication occurs.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 Can be an ARN , Key ID , or Alias .

              Status -> (string)
                 The status can be InProgress , Failed , or InSync .

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 Status message such as "Secret with this name already  exists
                 in this region ".

              LastAccessedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  that  the  secret was last accessed in the Region.
                 This field is omitted if the secret has never been  retrieved
                 in the Region.
