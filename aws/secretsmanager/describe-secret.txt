DESCRIBE-SECRET()                                            DESCRIBE-SECRET()



NAME
       describe-secret -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  details  of a secret. It does not include the encrypted
       secret value. Secrets Manager only returns fields that have a value  in
       the response.

       Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this ac-
       tion. Do not include sensitive information in  request  parameters  be-
       cause  it  might  be  logged. For more information, see Logging Secrets
       Manager events with CloudTrail .
          Required permissions:  secretsmanager:DescribeSecret . For more  in-
          formation,   see   IAM   policy  actions  for  Secrets  Manager  and
          Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager .

SYNOPSIS
            describe-secret
          --secret-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or name of the secret.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN. See Finding a secret from a partial ARN .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve the details of a secret

       The following describe-secret example shows the details of a secret.

          aws secretsmanager describe-secret \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret

OUTPUT
       ARN -> (string)
          The ARN of the secret.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the secret.

       Description -> (string)
          The description of the secret.

       KmsKeyId -> (string)
          The  key ID or alias ARN of the KMS key that Secrets Manager uses to
          encrypt the secret value. If the secret is encrypted with the Amazon
          Web Services managed key aws/secretsmanager , this field is omitted.
          Secrets created using the console use an KMS key ID.

       RotationEnabled -> (boolean)
          Specifies whether automatic rotation is turned on for this secret.

          To turn on rotation, use  RotateSecret . To turn off  rotation,  use
          CancelRotateSecret .

       RotationLambdaARN -> (string)
          The  ARN  of the Lambda function that Secrets Manager invokes to ro-
          tate the secret.

       RotationRules -> (structure)
          The rotation schedule and Lambda function for this  secret.  If  the
          secret  previously had rotation turned on, but it is now turned off,
          this field shows the previous rotation schedule and  rotation  func-
          tion.  If  the  secret  never  had rotation turned on, this field is
          omitted.

          AutomaticallyAfterDays -> (long)
              The number of days between rotations of the secret. You can  use
              this  value  to  check  that  your  secret meets your compliance
              guidelines for how often secrets must be  rotated.  If  you  use
              this  field to set the rotation schedule, Secrets Manager calcu-
              lates the next rotation date based  on  the  previous  rotation.
              Manually  updating the secret value by calling PutSecretValue or
              UpdateSecret is considered a valid rotation.

              In DescribeSecret and ListSecrets ,  this  value  is  calculated
              from  the  rotation schedule after every successful rotation. In
              RotateSecret , you can set the rotation  schedule  in  Rotation-
              Rules  with  AutomaticallyAfterDays  or ScheduleExpression , but
              not both. To set a rotation schedule in hours,  use  ScheduleEx-
              pression .

          Duration -> (string)
              The length of the rotation window in hours, for example 3h for a
              three hour window. Secrets Manager rotates your  secret  at  any
              time  during  this  window.  The window must not extend into the
              next rotation window or the next UTC day. The window starts  ac-
              cording to the ScheduleExpression . If you don't specify a Dura-
              tion , for a ScheduleExpression in hours, the  window  automati-
              cally  closes  after one hour. For a ScheduleExpression in days,
              the window automatically closes at the end of the UTC  day.  For
              more  information,  including examples, see Schedule expressions
              in Secrets Manager rotation in the Secrets Manager Users Guide .

          ScheduleExpression -> (string)
              A cron() or rate() expression that defines the schedule for  ro-
              tating  your  secret. Secrets Manager rotation schedules use UTC
              time zone. Secrets Manager rotates your secret any time during a
              rotation window.

              Secrets  Manager  rate()  expressions  represent the interval in
              hours or days that you want to rotate your secret,  for  example
              rate(12 hours) or rate(10 days) . You can rotate a secret as of-
              ten as every four hours. If you use a rate() expression, the ro-
              tation  window  starts at midnight. For a rate in hours, the de-
              fault rotation window closes after one hour. For a rate in days,
              the  default  rotation  window closes at the end of the day. You
              can set the Duration to change the rotation window. The rotation
              window  must  not  extend into the next UTC day or into the next
              rotation window.

              You can use a cron() expression to create  a  rotation  schedule
              that  is more detailed than a rotation interval. For more infor-
              mation, including examples, see Schedule expressions in  Secrets
              Manager rotation in the Secrets Manager Users Guide . For a cron
              expression that represents a schedule in hours, the default  ro-
              tation  window closes after one hour. For a cron expression that
              represents a schedule  in  days,  the  default  rotation  window
              closes at the end of the day. You can set the Duration to change
              the rotation window. The rotation window must  not  extend  into
              the next UTC day or into the next rotation window.

       LastRotatedDate -> (timestamp)
          The  last  date and time that Secrets Manager rotated the secret. If
          the secret isn't configured for rotation or rotation has  been  dis-
          abled, Secrets Manager returns null.

       LastChangedDate -> (timestamp)
          The last date and time that this secret was modified in any way.

       LastAccessedDate -> (timestamp)
          The date that the secret was last accessed in the Region. This field
          is omitted if the secret has never been retrieved in the Region.

       DeletedDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the secret is scheduled for deletion. If it is  not  sched-
          uled  for deletion, this field is omitted. When you delete a secret,
          Secrets Manager requires a recovery window of at least 7 days before
          deleting  the secret. Some time after the deleted date, Secrets Man-
          ager deletes the secret, including all of its versions.

          If a secret is scheduled for deletion, then its  details,  including
          the encrypted secret value, is not accessible. To cancel a scheduled
          deletion and restore access to the secret, use  RestoreSecret .

       NextRotationDate -> (timestamp)
          The next rotation is scheduled to occur on or before this  date.  If
          the  secret  isn't configured for rotation or rotation has been dis-
          abled, Secrets Manager returns null.

       Tags -> (list)
          The list of tags attached to the secret. To add tags  to  a  secret,
          use  TagResource . To remove tags, use  UntagResource .

          (structure)
              A structure that contains information about a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The string value associated with the key of the tag.

       VersionIdsToStages -> (map)
          A  list  of  the versions of the secret that have staging labels at-
          tached. Versions that don't have staging labels are considered  dep-
          recated and Secrets Manager can delete them.

          Secrets  Manager uses staging labels to indicate the status of a se-
          cret version during rotation. The three staging labels for  rotation
          are:

          o AWSCURRENT , which indicates the current version of the secret.

          o AWSPENDING  ,  which indicates the version of the secret that con-
            tains new secret information that will  become  the  next  current
            version  when  rotation finishes. During rotation, Secrets Manager
            creates an AWSPENDING version ID before creating  the  new  secret
            version. To check if a secret version exists, call  GetSecretValue
            .

          o AWSPREVIOUS , which indicates the previous current version of  the
            secret. You can use this as the last known good version.

          For  more information about rotation and staging labels, see How ro-
          tation works .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       OwningService -> (string)
          The ID of the service that created this secret.  For  more  informa-
          tion, see Secrets managed by other Amazon Web Services services .

       CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the secret was created.

       PrimaryRegion -> (string)
          The  Region the secret is in. If a secret is replicated to other Re-
          gions, the replicas are listed in ReplicationStatus .

       ReplicationStatus -> (list)
          A list of the replicas of this secret and their status:

          o Failed , which indicates that the replica was not created.

          o InProgress , which  indicates  that  Secrets  Manager  is  in  the
            process of creating the replica.

          o InSync , which indicates that the replica was created.

          (structure)
              A replication object consisting of a RegionReplicationStatus ob-
              ject and includes a Region, KMSKeyId, status,  and  status  mes-
              sage.

              Region -> (string)
                 The Region where replication occurs.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 Can be an ARN , Key ID , or Alias .

              Status -> (string)

                 in this region ".

              LastAccessedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date that the secret was last  accessed  in  the  Region.
                 This  field is omitted if the secret has never been retrieved
                 in the Region.
