NAME
       remove-regions-from-replication -

DESCRIPTION
       For  a  secret  that is replicated to other Regions, deletes the secret
       replicas from the Regions you specify.

       Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this ac-
       tion.  Do  not  include sensitive information in request parameters be-
       cause it might be logged. For more  information,  see  Logging  Secrets
       Manager events with CloudTrail .
          Required permissions:  secretsmanager:RemoveRegionsFromReplication .
          For more information, see IAM policy actions for Secrets Manager and
          Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager .

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or name of the secret.

       --remove-replica-regions (list)
          The Regions of the replicas to remove.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete a replica secret

       The following remove-regions-from-replication example deletes a replica
       secret  in  eu-west-3. To delete a primary secret that is replicated to
       other regions, first delete the replicas and then call delete-secret.

          aws secretsmanager remove-regions-from-replication \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret \
              --remove-replica-regions eu-west-3

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-1a2b3c",
              "ReplicationStatus": []
          }

       For more information, see Delete a replica secret in the  Secrets  Man-
       ager User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ARN -> (string)
          The ARN of the primary secret.

       ReplicationStatus -> (list)
          The status of replicas for this secret after you remove Regions.

          (structure)
              A replication object consisting of a RegionReplicationStatus ob-
              ject and includes a Region, KMSKeyId, status,  and  status  mes-
              sage.

              Region -> (string)
                 The Region where replication occurs.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 Can be an ARN , Key ID , or Alias .

              Status -> (string)
                 The status can be InProgress , Failed , or InSync .

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 Status  message such as "Secret with this name already exists
                 in this region ".

              LastAccessedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date that the secret was last  accessed  in  the  Region.
                 This  field is omitted if the secret has never been retrieved
                 in the Region.
