STOP-REPLICATION-TO-REPLICA()                    STOP-REPLICATION-TO-REPLICA()



NAME
       stop-replication-to-replica -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  the link between the replica secret and the primary secret and
       promotes the replica to a primary secret in the replica Region.

       You must call this operation from the Region in which you want to  pro-
       mote the replica to a primary secret.
          Required permissions:  secretsmanager:StopReplicationToReplica . For
          more information, see IAM policy actions  for  Secrets  Manager  and
          Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-replication-to-replica
          --secret-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN of the primary secret.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To promote a replica secret to a primary

       The  following stop-replication-to-replica example removes the link be-
       tween a replica secret to the primary. The replica secret  is  promoted
       to  a primary secret in the replica region. You must call stop-replica-
       tion-to-replica from within the replica region.

          aws secretsmanager stop-replication-to-replica \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3"
          }

       For more information, see Promote a replica secret in the Secrets  Man-
       ager User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ARN -> (string)
          The  ARN of the promoted secret. The ARN is the same as the original
          primary secret except the Region is changed.
