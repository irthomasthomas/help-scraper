ROTATE-SECRET()                                                ROTATE-SECRET()



NAME
       rotate-secret -

DESCRIPTION
       Configures  and starts the asynchronous process of rotating the secret.
       For more information about rotation, see Rotate secrets .

       If you include the configuration parameters,  the  operation  sets  the
       values  for  the  secret and then immediately starts a rotation. If you
       don't include the configuration parameters, the operation starts a  ro-
       tation with the values already stored in the secret.

       For  database credentials you want to rotate, for Secrets Manager to be
       able to rotate the secret, you must make sure the secret  value  is  in
       the JSON structure of a database secret . In particular, if you want to
       use the alternating users strategy , your secret must contain  the  ARN
       of a superuser secret.

       To  configure rotation, you also need the ARN of an Amazon Web Services
       Lambda function and the schedule for the rotation. The Lambda  rotation
       function creates a new version of the secret and creates or updates the
       credentials on the database or service to match. After testing the  new
       credentials, the function marks the new secret version with the staging
       label AWSCURRENT . Then anyone who retrieves the secret  gets  the  new
       version. For more information, see How rotation works .

       You can create the Lambda rotation function based on the rotation func-
       tion templates that Secrets Manager provides. Choose  a  template  that
       matches your Rotation strategy .

       When  rotation is successful, the AWSPENDING staging label might be at-
       tached to the same version as the AWSCURRENT version, or it  might  not
       be  attached to any version. If the AWSPENDING staging label is present
       but not attached to the same version as AWSCURRENT , then any later in-
       vocation  of  RotateSecret  assumes that a previous rotation request is
       still in progress and returns an error.
          Required permissions:  secretsmanager:RotateSecret . For more infor-
          mation,   see   IAM   policy   actions   for   Secrets  Manager  and
          Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager . You also need
          lambda:InvokeFunction permissions on the rotation function. For more
          information, see Permissions for rotation .

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or name of the secret to rotate.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN. See Finding a secret from a partial ARN .

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique identifier for the new version of the secret that helps en-
          sure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the ac-
          cidental  creation  of  duplicate versions if there are failures and
          retries during rotation. This value becomes the VersionId of the new
          version.

          If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web Ser-
          vices SDK to call this operation, then you can leave this  parameter
          empty.  The  CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes
          that in the request for this parameter. If you don't use the SDK and
          instead  generate  a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service
          endpoint, then you must generate a ClientRequestToken  yourself  for
          new versions and include that value in the request.

          You  only need to specify this value if you implement your own retry
          logic and you want to ensure that Secrets Manager doesn't attempt to
          create  a  secret  version  twice.  We recommend that you generate a
          UUID-type value to ensure uniqueness within the specified secret.

       --rotation-lambda-arn (string)
          The ARN of the Lambda rotation function that can rotate the secret.

       --rotation-rules (structure)
          A structure that defines the rotation configuration for this secret.

          AutomaticallyAfterDays -> (long)
              The number of days between automatic scheduled rotations of  the
              secret.  You  can use this value to check that your secret meets
              your compliance guidelines for how often  secrets  must  be  ro-
              tated.

              In  DescribeSecret  and  ListSecrets  , this value is calculated
              from the rotation schedule after every successful  rotation.  In
              RotateSecret  ,  you  can set the rotation schedule in Rotation-
              Rules with AutomaticallyAfterDays or  ScheduleExpression  ,  but
              not both.

          Duration -> (string)
              The length of the rotation window in hours, for example 3h for a
              three hour window. Secrets Manager rotates your  secret  at  any
              time  during  this  window. The window must not go into the next
              UTC day. If you don't specify this value, the  window  automati-
              cally  ends at the end of the UTC day. The window begins accord-
              ing to the ScheduleExpression . For more information,  including
              examples, see Schedule expressions in Secrets Manager rotation .

          ScheduleExpression -> (string)
              A  cron() or rate() expression that defines the schedule for ro-
              tating your secret. Secrets Manager rotation schedules  use  UTC
              time zone.

              Secrets  Manager  rate()  expressions  represent the interval in
              days that you want to rotate your secret,  for  example  rate(10
              days)  .  If  you  use  a rate() expression, the rotation window
              opens at midnight, and Secrets Manager rotates your  secret  any
              time  that day after midnight. You can set a Duration to shorten
              the rotation window.

              You can use a cron() expression  to  create  rotation  schedules
              that are more detailed than a rotation interval. For more infor-
              mation, including examples, see Schedule expressions in  Secrets
              Manager  rotation . If you use a cron() expression, Secrets Man-
              ager rotates your secret any time during that day after the win-
              dow  opens. For example, cron(0 8 1 * ? *) represents a rotation
              window that occurs on the first day of every month beginning  at
              8:00  AM  UTC.  Secrets Manager rotates the secret any time that
              day after 8:00 AM. You can set a Duration to shorten  the  rota-
              tion window.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AutomaticallyAfterDays=long,Duration=string,ScheduleExpression=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AutomaticallyAfterDays": long,
            "Duration": "string",
            "ScheduleExpression": "string"
          }

       --rotate-immediately | --no-rotate-immediately (boolean)
          Specifies whether to rotate the secret immediately or wait until the
          next scheduled rotation window. The rotation schedule is defined  in
          RotateSecretRequest$RotationRules .

          If  you  don't  immediately rotate the secret, Secrets Manager tests
          the rotation configuration by  running  the  `  testSecret  step  <-
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/ro-
          tate-secrets_how.html>`__ of the Lambda rotation function. The  test
          creates an AWSPENDING version of the secret and then removes it.

          If  you  don't  specify this value, then by default, Secrets Manager
          rotates the secret immediately.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To configure and start automatic rotation for a secret

       The following rotate-secret example configures and starts automatic ro-
       tation  for  a  secret. Secrets Manager rotates the secret once immedi-
       ately, and then on the 1st and 15th day of every month between 4:00  PM
       and  6:00 PM UTC. The output shows the VersionId of the new secret ver-
       sion created by rotation.

          aws secretsmanager rotate-secret \
              --secret-id MyTestDatabaseSecret \
              --rotation-lambda-arn arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:1234566789012:function:SecretsManagerTestRotationLambda \
              --rotation-rules "{\"ScheduleExpression\": \"cron(0 16 1,15 * ? *)\", \"Duration\": \"2h\"}"

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "aws:arn:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestDatabaseSecret",
              "VersionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
          }

       Guide.

       Example  2: To configure and start automatic rotation on a rotation in-
       terval

       The following rotate-secret example configures and starts automatic ro-
       tation  for  a  secret. Secrets Manager rotates the secret once immedi-
       ately, and then every 10 days. The output shows the  VersionId  of  the
       new secret version created by rotation.

          aws secretsmanager rotate-secret \
              --secret-id MyTestDatabaseSecret \
              --rotation-lambda-arn arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:1234566789012:function:SecretsManagerTestRotationLambda \
              --rotation-rules "{\"ScheduleExpression\": \"rate(10 days)\"}"

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "aws:arn:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestDatabaseSecret",
              "VersionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
          }

       For  more  information,  see Rotate secrets in the Secrets Manager User
       Guide.

       Example 3: To rotate a secret immediately

       The following rotate-secret example starts an immediate  rotation.  The
       output  shows  the VersionId of the new secret version created by rota-
       tion. The secret must already have rotation configured.

          aws secretsmanager rotate-secret \
              --secret-id MyTestDatabaseSecret

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "aws:arn:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestDatabaseSecret",
