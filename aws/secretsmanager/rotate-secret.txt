ROTATE-SECRET()                                                ROTATE-SECRET()



NAME
       rotate-secret -

DESCRIPTION
       Configures  and starts the asynchronous process of rotating the secret.
       For information about rotation, see Rotate secrets in the Secrets  Man-
       ager  User Guide . If you include the configuration parameters, the op-
       eration sets the values for the secret and then  immediately  starts  a
       rotation. If you don't include the configuration parameters, the opera-
       tion starts a rotation with the values already stored in the secret.

       When rotation is successful, the AWSPENDING staging label might be  at-
       tached  to  the same version as the AWSCURRENT version, or it might not
       be attached to any version. If the AWSPENDING staging label is  present
       but not attached to the same version as AWSCURRENT , then any later in-
       vocation of RotateSecret assumes that a previous  rotation  request  is
       still  in progress and returns an error. When rotation is unsuccessful,
       the AWSPENDING staging label might be attached to an empty secret  ver-
       sion.  For  more  information, see Troubleshoot rotation in the Secrets
       Manager User Guide .

       Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this ac-
       tion.  Do  not  include sensitive information in request parameters be-
       cause it might be logged. For more  information,  see  Logging  Secrets
       Manager events with CloudTrail .
          Required permissions:  secretsmanager:RotateSecret . For more infor-
          mation,  see  IAM   policy   actions   for   Secrets   Manager   and
          Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager . You also need
          lambda:InvokeFunction permissions on the rotation function. For more
          information, see Permissions for rotation .

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or name of the secret to rotate.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN. See Finding a secret from a partial ARN .

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique identifier for the new version of the secret. You only need
          to  specify this value if you implement your own retry logic and you
          want to ensure that Secrets Manager doesn't attempt to create a  se-
          cret version twice.

          NOTE:
              If  you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web
              Services SDKs to call this operation, then you  can  leave  this
              parameter  empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you
              and includes it as the value for this parameter in the request.

          If you generate a raw HTTP request to the  Secrets  Manager  service
          endpoint, then you must generate a ClientRequestToken and include it
          in the request.

          This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value
          to  prevent  the  accidental creation of duplicate versions if there
          are failures and retries during a rotation. We  recommend  that  you
          generate  a  UUID-type  value  to ensure uniqueness of your versions
          within the specified secret.

       --rotation-lambda-arn (string)
          For secrets that use a Lambda rotation function to rotate,  the  ARN
          of the Lambda rotation function.

          For  secrets  that  use managed rotation , omit this field. For more
          information, see Managed rotation in the Secrets Manager User  Guide
          .

       --rotation-rules (structure)
          A structure that defines the rotation configuration for this secret.

          AutomaticallyAfterDays -> (long)
              The  number of days between rotations of the secret. You can use
              this value to check  that  your  secret  meets  your  compliance
              guidelines  for  how  often  secrets must be rotated. If you use
              this field to set the rotation schedule, Secrets Manager  calcu-
              lates  the  next  rotation  date based on the previous rotation.
              Manually updating the secret value by calling PutSecretValue  or
              UpdateSecret is considered a valid rotation.

              In  DescribeSecret  and  ListSecrets  , this value is calculated
              from the rotation schedule after every successful  rotation.  In
              RotateSecret  ,  you  can set the rotation schedule in Rotation-
              Rules with AutomaticallyAfterDays or  ScheduleExpression  ,  but
              not  both.  To set a rotation schedule in hours, use ScheduleEx-
              pression .

          Duration -> (string)
              The length of the rotation window in hours, for example 3h for a
              three  hour  window.  Secrets Manager rotates your secret at any
              time during this window. The window must  not  extend  into  the
              next  rotation window or the next UTC day. The window starts ac-
              cording to the ScheduleExpression . If you don't specify a Dura-
              tion  ,  for a ScheduleExpression in hours, the window automati-
              cally closes after one hour. For a ScheduleExpression  in  days,
              the  window  automatically closes at the end of the UTC day. For
              more information, including examples, see  Schedule  expressions
              in Secrets Manager rotation in the Secrets Manager Users Guide .

          ScheduleExpression -> (string)
              A  cron() or rate() expression that defines the schedule for ro-
              tating your secret. Secrets Manager rotation schedules  use  UTC
              time zone. Secrets Manager rotates your secret any time during a
              rotation window.

              Secrets Manager rate() expressions  represent  the  interval  in
              hours  or  days that you want to rotate your secret, for example
              rate(12 hours) or rate(10 days) . You can rotate a secret as of-
              ten as every four hours. If you use a rate() expression, the ro-
              tation window starts at midnight. For a rate in hours,  the  de-
              fault rotation window closes after one hour. For a rate in days,
              the default rotation window closes at the end of  the  day.  You
              can set the Duration to change the rotation window. The rotation
              window must not extend into the next UTC day or  into  the  next
              rotation window.

              You  can  use  a cron() expression to create a rotation schedule
              that is more detailed than a rotation interval. For more  infor-
              mation,  including examples, see Schedule expressions in Secrets
              Manager rotation in the Secrets Manager Users Guide . For a cron
              expression  that represents a schedule in hours, the default ro-
              tation window closes after one hour. For a cron expression  that
              represents  a  schedule  in  days,  the  default rotation window
              closes at the end of the day. You can set the Duration to change
              the  rotation  window.  The rotation window must not extend into
              the next UTC day or into the next rotation window.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AutomaticallyAfterDays=long,Duration=string,ScheduleExpression=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AutomaticallyAfterDays": long,
            "Duration": "string",
            "ScheduleExpression": "string"
          }

       --rotate-immediately | --no-rotate-immediately (boolean)
          Specifies whether to rotate the secret immediately or wait until the
          next  scheduled rotation window. The rotation schedule is defined in
          RotateSecretRequest$RotationRules .

          For secrets that use a Lambda rotation function to  rotate,  if  you
          don't immediately rotate the secret, Secrets Manager tests the rota-
          tion  configuration  by   running   the   `   testSecret   step   <-
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/ro-
          tate-secrets_how.html>`__ of the Lambda rotation function. The  test
          creates an AWSPENDING version of the secret and then removes it.

          By default, Secrets Manager rotates the secret immediately.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To configure and start automatic rotation for a secret

       The following rotate-secret example configures and starts automatic ro-
       tation for a secret. Secrets Manager rotates the  secret  once  immedi-
       ately,  and  then  every  eight  hours in a two hour window. The output
       shows the VersionId of the new secret version created by rotation.

          aws secretsmanager rotate-secret \
              --secret-id MyTestDatabaseSecret \
              --rotation-lambda-arn arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:1234566789012:function:SecretsManagerTestRotationLambda \
              --rotation-rules "{\"ScheduleExpression\": \"cron(0 8/8 * * ? *)\", \"Duration\": \"2h\"}"

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "aws:arn:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestDatabaseSecret",
              "VersionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
          }

       For more information, see Rotate secrets in the  Secrets  Manager  User
       Guide.

       Example  2: To configure and start automatic rotation on a rotation in-
       terval

       The following rotate-secret example configures and starts automatic ro-
       tation  for  a  secret. Secrets Manager rotates the secret once immedi-
       ately, and then every 10 days. The output shows the  VersionId  of  the
       new secret version created by rotation.

          aws secretsmanager rotate-secret \
              --secret-id MyTestDatabaseSecret \
              --rotation-lambda-arn arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:1234566789012:function:SecretsManagerTestRotationLambda \
              --rotation-rules "{\"ScheduleExpression\": \"rate(10 days)\"}"

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "aws:arn:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestDatabaseSecret",
              "VersionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
          }

       For  more  information,  see Rotate secrets in the Secrets Manager User
       Guide.

       Example 3: To rotate a secret immediately

       The following rotate-secret example starts an immediate  rotation.  The
       output  shows  the VersionId of the new secret version created by rota-
       tion. The secret must already have rotation configured.

          aws secretsmanager rotate-secret \
              --secret-id MyTestDatabaseSecret

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "aws:arn:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestDatabaseSecret",
              "VersionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
          }
