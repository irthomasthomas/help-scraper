UPDATE-SECRET-VERSION-STAGE()                    UPDATE-SECRET-VERSION-STAGE()



NAME
       update-secret-version-stage -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  the staging labels attached to a version of a secret. Secrets
       Manager uses staging labels to track a version as it progresses through
       the secret rotation process. Each staging label can be attached to only
       one version at a time. To add a staging label to a version when  it  is
       already  attached  to another version, Secrets Manager first removes it
       from the other version first and then attaches it to this one. For more
       information about versions and staging labels, see Concepts: Version .

       The  staging  labels that you specify in the VersionStage parameter are
       added to the existing list of staging labels for the version.

       You can move the AWSCURRENT staging label to this version by  including
       it in this call.

       NOTE:
          Whenever  you  move AWSCURRENT , Secrets Manager automatically moves
          the label AWSPREVIOUS to the version  that  AWSCURRENT  was  removed
          from.

       If  this action results in the last label being removed from a version,
       then the version is considered to be 'deprecated' and can be deleted by
       Secrets Manager.

       Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this ac-
       tion. Do not include sensitive information in  request  parameters  be-
       cause  it  might  be  logged. For more information, see Logging Secrets
       Manager events with CloudTrail .
          Required permissions:  secretsmanager:UpdateSecretVersionStage . For
          more  information,  see  IAM  policy actions for Secrets Manager and
          Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager .

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or the name of the secret with the version and  staging  la-
          belsto modify.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN. See Finding a secret from a partial ARN .

       --version-stage (string)
          The staging label to add to this version.

       --remove-from-version-id (string)
          The ID of the version that the staging label is to be removed  from.
          If  the staging label you are trying to attach to one version is al-
          ready attached to a different version, then you  must  include  this
          parameter  and  specify  the version that the label is to be removed
          from. If the label is attached and you either do  not  specify  this
          parameter,  or  the  version  ID  does not match, then the operation
          fails.

       --move-to-version-id (string)
          The ID of the version to add the staging label to. To remove a label
          from a version, then do not specify this parameter.

          If  the  staging label is already attached to a different version of
          the secret, then you must also specify the  RemoveFromVersionId  pa-
          rameter.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To revert a secret to the previous version

       The  following update-secret-version-stage example moves the AWSCURRENT
       staging label to the previous version of a secret,  which  reverts  the
       secret  to  the  previous version. To find the ID for the previous ver-
       sion, use list-secret-version-ids. For this example, the  version  with
       the  AWSCURRENT  label  is a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 and the
       version with the  AWSPREVIOUS  label  is  a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAM-
       PLE22222.  In  this example, you move the AWSCURRENT label from version
       11111 to 22222. Because the AWSCURRENT label is removed from a version,
       update-secret-version-stage  automatically  moves the AWSPREVIOUS label
       to that version (11111). The effect is that the AWSCURRENT and  AWSPRE-
       VIOUS versions are swapped.

          aws secretsmanager update-secret-version-stage \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret \
              --version-stage AWSCURRENT \
              --move-to-version-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222 \
              --remove-from-version-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestSecret"
          }

       For more information, see Version in the Secrets Manager User Guide.

       Example 2: To add a staging label attached to a version of a secret

       The  following update-secret-version-stage example adds a staging label
       to a version of a  secret.  You  can  review  the  results  by  running
       list-secret-version-ids  and  viewing  the VersionStages response field
       for the affected version.

          aws secretsmanager update-secret-version-stage \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret \
              --version-stage STAGINGLABEL1 \
              --move-to-version-id EXAMPLE1-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestSecret"
          }

       For more information, see Version in the Secrets Manager User Guide.

       Example 3: To delete a staging label attached to a version of a secret

       The following update-secret-version-stage example deletes a staging la-
       bel  that  is attached to a version of a secret. You can review the re-
       sults by running list-secret-version-ids and viewing the  VersionStages
       response field for the affected version.

          aws secretsmanager update-secret-version-stage \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret \
              --version-stage STAGINGLABEL1 \
              --remove-from-version-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestSecret"
          }

       For more information, see Version in the Secrets Manager User Guide.
