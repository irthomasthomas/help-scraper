GET-RANDOM-PASSWORD()                                    GET-RANDOM-PASSWORD()



NAME
       get-random-password -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  a random password. We recommend that you specify the maximum
       length and include every character type that the system you are  gener-
       ating  a password for can support. By default, Secrets Manager uses up-
       percase and lowercase letters, numbers, and the following characters in
       passwords: !\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~

       Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this ac-
       tion.
          Required permissions:  secretsmanager:GetRandomPassword .  For  more
          information,   see  IAM  policy  actions  for  Secrets  Manager  and
          Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager .

OPTIONS
       --password-length (long)
          The length of the password. If you don't include this parameter, the
          default length is 32 characters.

       --exclude-characters (string)
          A string of the characters that you don't want in the password.

       --exclude-numbers | --no-exclude-numbers (boolean)
          Specifies whether to exclude numbers from the password. If you don't
          include this switch, the password can contain numbers.

       --exclude-punctuation | --no-exclude-punctuation (boolean)
          Specifies whether to exclude the  following  punctuation  characters
          from the password: ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \ ]
          ^ _ ` { | } ~ . If you don't include this switch, the  password  can
          contain punctuation.

       --exclude-uppercase | --no-exclude-uppercase (boolean)
          Specifies whether to exclude uppercase letters from the password. If
          you don't include this switch, the password  can  contain  uppercase
          letters.

       --exclude-lowercase | --no-exclude-lowercase (boolean)
          Specifies whether to exclude lowercase letters from the password. If
          you don't include this switch, the password  can  contain  lowercase
          letters.

       --include-space | --no-include-space (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  to  include  the space character. If you include
          this switch, the password can contain space characters.

       --require-each-included-type |  --no-require-each-included-type  (bool-
       ean)
          Specifies  whether  to include at least one upper and lowercase let-
          ter, one number, and one punctuation.  If  you  don't  include  this
          switch, the password contains at least one of every character type.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To generate a random password

       The following get-random-password example generates a  random  password
       20  characters long that includes at least one uppercase letter, lower-
       case letter, number, and punctuation.

          aws secretsmanager get-random-password \
              --require-each-included-type \
              --password-length 20

       Output:

          {
              "RandomPassword": "EXAMPLE-PASSWORD"
          }

       For more information, see Create and manage secrets in the Secrets Man-
       ager User Guide.

OUTPUT
       RandomPassword -> (string)
          A string with the password.
