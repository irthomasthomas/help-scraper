DELETE-SECRET()                                                DELETE-SECRET()



NAME
       delete-secret -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  secret  and all of its versions. You can specify a recovery
       window during which you can restore the secret.  The  minimum  recovery
       window  is 7 days. The default recovery window is 30 days. Secrets Man-
       ager attaches a DeletionDate stamp to the secret that specifies the end
       of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, Secrets Man-
       ager deletes the secret permanently.

       You can't delete a primary secret that is replicated to other  Regions.
       You  must first delete the replicas using  RemoveRegionsFromReplication
       , and then delete the primary secret. When you delete a replica, it  is
       deleted immediately.

       You  can't  directly  delete a version of a secret. Instead, you remove
       all staging labels from the version using   UpdateSecretVersionStage  .
       This  marks the version as deprecated, and then Secrets Manager can au-
       tomatically delete the version in the background.

       To determine whether an application still uses a secret, you can create
       an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to alert you to any attempts to access a se-
       cret during the recovery window. For more information, see Monitor  se-
       crets scheduled for deletion .

       Secrets  Manager  performs  the permanent secret deletion at the end of
       the waiting period as a background task with low priority. There is  no
       guarantee  of  a specific time after the recovery window for the perma-
       nent delete to occur.

       At any time before recovery window ends, you can use  RestoreSecret  to
       remove the DeletionDate and cancel the deletion of the secret.

       When a secret is scheduled for deletion, you cannot retrieve the secret
       value. You must first cancel the deletion with  RestoreSecret and  then
       you can retrieve the secret.

       Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this ac-
       tion. Do not include sensitive information in  request  parameters  be-
       cause  it  might  be  logged. For more information, see Logging Secrets
       Manager events with CloudTrail .
          Required permissions:  secretsmanager:DeleteSecret . For more infor-
          mation,   see   IAM   policy   actions   for   Secrets  Manager  and
          Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-secret
          --secret-id <value>
          [--recovery-window-in-days <value>]
          [--force-delete-without-recovery | --no-force-delete-without-recovery]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or name of the secret to delete.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN. See Finding a secret from a partial ARN .

       --recovery-window-in-days (long)
          The  number  of  days from 7 to 30 that Secrets Manager waits before
          permanently deleting the secret. You can't use both  this  parameter
          and  ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery  in  the same call. If you don't use
          either, then by default Secrets Manager uses a 30 day recovery  win-
          dow.

       --force-delete-without-recovery   |  --no-force-delete-without-recovery
       (boolean)
          Specifies whether to delete the secret without any recovery  window.
          You  can't  use  both this parameter and RecoveryWindowInDays in the
          same call. If you don't use either, then by default Secrets  Manager
          uses a 30 day recovery window.

          Secrets  Manager  performs  the actual deletion with an asynchronous
          background process, so there might be a short delay before  the  se-
          cret is permanently deleted. If you delete a secret and then immedi-
          ately create a secret with the same name, use appropriate  back  off
          and retry logic.

          WARNING:
              Use this parameter with caution. This parameter causes the oper-
              ation to skip the normal recovery window  before  the  permanent
              deletion that Secrets Manager would normally impose with the Re-
              coveryWindowInDays parameter. If you delete a  secret  with  the
              ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery  parameter, then you have no opportu-
              nity to recover the secret. You lose the secret permanently.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To delete a secret

       The following delete-secret example deletes a secret. You  can  recover
       the secret with restore-secret until the date and time in the Deletion-
       Date response field. To delete a secret that is replicated to other re-
       gions,  first remove its replicas with remove-regions-from-replication,
       and then call delete-secret.

          aws secretsmanager delete-secret \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret \
              --recovery-window-in-days 7

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestSecret",
              "DeletionDate": 1524085349.095
          }

       For more information, see Delete a secret in the Secrets  Manager  User
       Guide.

       Example 2: To delete a secret immediately

       The  following delete-secret example deletes a secret immediately with-
       out a recovery window. You can't recover this secret.

          aws secretsmanager delete-secret \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret \
              --force-delete-without-recovery

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestSecret",
              "DeletionDate": 1508750180.309
          }
