NAME
       converse -

DESCRIPTION
       Sends messages to the specified Amazon Bedrock model. Converse provides
       a consistent interface that works with all  models  that  support  mes-
       sages.  This  allows  you  to write code once and use it with different
       models. Should a model have unique inference parameters, you  can  also
       pass those unique parameters to the model.

       For information about the Converse API, see Use the Converse API in the
       Amazon Bedrock User Guide . To use a guardrail,  see  Use  a  guardrail
       with  the Converse API in the Amazon Bedrock User Guide . To use a tool
       with a model, see Tool use (Function calling)  in  the  Amazon  Bedrock
       User Guide

       For  example code, see Converse API examples in the Amazon Bedrock User
       Guide .

       This operation requires permission for the bedrock:InvokeModel action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       converse uses document type values. Document types follow the JSON data
       model where valid values are: strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays,
       and objects. For command input, options and nested parameters that  are
       labeled with the type document must be provided as JSON. Shorthand syn-
       tax does not support document types.

OPTIONS
       --model-id (string)
          The identifier for the model that you want to call.

          The modelId to provide depends on the type of model that you use:

          o If you use a base model, specify the model ID or its  ARN.  For  a
            list  of  model IDs for base models, see Amazon Bedrock base model
            IDs (on-demand throughput) in the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.

          o If you use a provisioned model, specify the ARN of the Provisioned
            Throughput. For more information, see Run inference using a Provi-
            sioned Throughput in the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.

          o If you use a custom model, first purchase  Provisioned  Throughput
            for  it.  Then specify the ARN of the resulting provisioned model.
            For more information, see Use a custom model in Amazon Bedrock  in
            the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.

       --messages (list)
          The messages that you want to send to the model.

          (structure)
              A  message  input,  or  returned  from,  a  call  to Converse or
              ConverseStream .

              role -> (string)
                 The role that the message plays in the message.

              content -> (list)
                 The message content. Note the following restrictions:

                 o You can include up to 20 images. Each image's size, height,
                   and  width  must be no more than 3.75 MB, 8000 px, and 8000
                   px, respectively.

                 o You can include up to five documents. Each document's  size
                   must be no more than 4.5 MB.

                 o If  you include a ContentBlock with a document field in the
                   array, you must also include a  ContentBlock  with  a  text
                   field.

                 o You  can  only  include images and documents if the role is
                   user .

                 (tagged union structure)
                     A block of content for a message that you pass to, or re-
                     ceive  from,  a model with the Converse or ConverseStream
                     API operations.

                     NOTE:
                        This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the fol-
                        lowing  top  level keys can be set: text, image, docu-
                        ment, toolUse, toolResult, guardContent.

                            The source for the image.

                            NOTE:
                               This  is  a Tagged Union structure. Only one of
                               the following top level keys can be set: bytes.

                            bytes -> (blob)
                               The raw image bytes for the image. If  you  use
                               an  AWS SDK, you don't need to encode the image
                               bytes in base64.

                     document -> (structure)
                        A document to include in the message.

                        format -> (string)
                            The format of a document, or its extension.

                        name -> (string)
                            A name for the document. The name can only contain
                            the following characters:

                            o Alphanumeric characters

                            o Whitespace  characters  (no  more  than one in a
                              row)

                            o Hyphens

                            o Parentheses

                            o Square brackets

                            NOTE:
                               This field is vulnerable to prompt  injections,
                               because the model might inadvertently interpret
                               it as  instructions.  Therefore,  we  recommend
                               that you specify a neutral name.

                        source -> (tagged union structure)
                            Contains the content of the document.

                            NOTE:

                               The raw bytes for the document. If you  use  an
                               Amazon  Web Services SDK, you don't need to en-
                               code the bytes in base64.

            ...
          ]

       --inference-config (structure)
          Inference  parameters to pass to the model. Converse supports a base
          set of inference parameters. If you need to pass additional  parame-
          ters  that  the model supports, use the additionalModelRequestFields
          request field.

          maxTokens -> (integer)
              The maximum number of tokens to allow in the generated response.
              The  default  value  is  the maximum allowed value for the model
              that you are using. For more information, see Inference  parame-
              ters for foundation models .

          temperature -> (float)
              The likelihood of the model selecting higher-probability options
              while generating a response. A lower value makes the model  more
              likely  to  choose  higher-probability  options,  while a higher
              value makes the model more likely  to  choose  lower-probability
              options.

              The  default  value  is the default value for the model that you
              are using. For more information, see  Inference  parameters  for
              foundation models .

          topP -> (float)
              The  percentage of most-likely candidates that the model consid-
              ers for the next token. For example, if you choose  a  value  of
              0.8  for topP , the model selects from the top 80% of the proba-
              bility distribution of tokens that could  be  next  in  the  se-
              quence.

              The  default  value  is the default value for the model that you
              are using. For more information, see  Inference  parameters  for
              foundation models .

          stopSequences -> (list)
              A list of stop sequences. A stop sequence is a sequence of char-
              acters that causes the model to stop generating the response.

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                               This  field is vulnerable to prompt injections,
                               because the model might inadvertently interpret
                               it  as  instructions.  Therefore,  we recommend
                               that you specify a neutral name.
