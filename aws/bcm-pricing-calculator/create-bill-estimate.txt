CREATE-BILL-ESTIMATE()                                  CREATE-BILL-ESTIMATE()



NAME
       create-bill-estimate -

DESCRIPTION
       Create  a  Bill estimate from a Bill scenario. In the Bill scenario you
       can model usage addition, usage changes, and  usage  removal.  You  can
       also  model  commitment  addition  and  commitment  removal.  After all
       changes in a Bill scenario is made satisfactorily, you  can  call  this
       API  with  a Bill scenario ID to generate the Bill estimate. Bill esti-
       mate calculates the pre-tax cost for your consolidated billing  family,
       incorporating  all modeled usage and commitments alongside existing us-
       age and commitments from your most recent completed  anniversary  bill,
       with any applicable discounts applied.

OPTIONS
       --bill-scenario-id (string)
          The  ID of the Bill Scenario for which you want to create a Bill es-
          timate.

       --name (string)
          The name of the Bill estimate that will be created.  Names  must  be
          unique for an account.

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request.

       --tags (map)
          An optional list of tags to associate with the  specified  BillEsti-
          mate.  You can use resource tags to control access to your BillEsti-
          mate using IAM policies. Each tag consists of a key and a value, and
          each key must be unique for the resource. The following restrictions
          apply to resource tags:

          o Although the maximum number of array members is 200, you  can  as-
            sign  a maximum of 50 user-tags to one resource. The remaining are
            reserved for Amazon Web Services.

          o The maximum length of a key is 128 characters.

          o The maximum length of a value is 256 characters.

          o Keys and values can only contain alphanumeric characters,  spaces,
            and any of the following: _.:/=+@- .

          o Keys and values are case sensitive.

          o Keys  and  values  are  trimmed for any leading or trailing white-
            spaces.

          o Don't use aws: as a prefix for your keys. This prefix is  reserved
            for Amazon Web Services.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
