       --usage-modifications (list)
          List of usage lines that you want to update in a Bill Scenario iden-
          tified by the usage ID.

          (structure)
              Represents an entry in a batch operation to update bill scenario
              usage modifications.

              id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the usage modification to update.

              group -> (string)
                 The updated group identifier for the usage modification.

              amounts -> (list)
                 The updated usage amounts for the modification.

                 (structure)

                     startHour -> (timestamp)
                        The start hour of the usage period.

                     amount -> (double)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          id=string,group=string,amounts=[{startHour=timestamp,amount=double},{startHour=timestamp,amount=double}] ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "id": "string",
              "group": "string",
              "amounts": [
                {
                  "startHour": timestamp,
                  "amount": double
                }
                ...

            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
