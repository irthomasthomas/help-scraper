OPTIONS
       --resource-group-name (string)
          The name of the resource group.

       --pattern-set-name (string)
          The name of the log pattern set.

       --pattern-name (string)
          The name of the log pattern.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ResourceGroupName -> (string)
          The name of the resource group.

       LogPattern -> (structure)
          The successfully created log pattern.

          PatternSetName -> (string)
              The name of the log pattern. A log pattern name can  contain  as
              many  as  30  characters, and it cannot be empty. The characters
              can be Unicode letters, digits, or one of the following symbols:
              period, dash, underscore.

          PatternName -> (string)
              The  name  of the log pattern. A log pattern name can contain as
              many as 50 characters, and it cannot be  empty.  The  characters
              can be Unicode letters, digits, or one of the following symbols:
              period, dash, underscore.

          Pattern -> (string)
              A regular expression that defines the log pattern. A log pattern
              can  contain  as  many as 50 characters, and it cannot be empty.
              The pattern must be DFA compatible. Patterns that  utilize  for-
              ward lookahead or backreference constructions are not supported.

          Rank -> (integer)
              Rank of the log pattern. Must be a value between 1 and 1,000,000
              . The patterns are sorted by rank, so we recommend that you  set
              your  highest  priority patterns with the lowest rank. A pattern
              of rank 1 will be the first to get matched to a log line. A pat-
              tern  of  rank  1,000,000  will be last to get matched. When you
              configure custom log patterns from the console, a  Low  severity
              pattern  translates to a 750,000 rank. A Medium severity pattern
              translates to a 500,000 rank. And a High severity pattern trans-
              lates to a 250,000 rank. Rank values less than 1 or greater than
              1,000,000 are reserved for AWS-provided patterns.
