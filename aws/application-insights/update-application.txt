       --cwe-monitor-enabled | --no-cwe-monitor-enabled (boolean)
          Indicates whether Application  Insights  can  listen  to  CloudWatch
          events  for the application resources, such as instance terminated ,
          failed deployment , and others.

       --ops-item-sns-topic-arn (string)
          The SNS topic provided to Application Insights that is associated to
          the created opsItem. Allows you to receive notifications for updates
          to the opsItem.

       --remove-sns-topic | --no-remove-sns-topic (boolean)
          Disassociates the SNS topic from the opsItem  created  for  detected
          problems.

          to the instance roles if they are missing.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-

       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not

       the string will be taken literally.

       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
