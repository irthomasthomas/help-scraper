LIST-TAGS-FOR-RESOURCE()                              LIST-TAGS-FOR-RESOURCE()



NAME
       list-tags-for-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve  a list of the tags (keys and values) that are associated with
       a specified application. A tag is a label that  you  optionally  define
       and  associate with an application. Each tag consists of a required tag
       key and an optional associated tag value . A tag key is a general label
       that  acts as a category for more specific tag values. A tag value acts
       as a descriptor within a tag key.

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the application that you  want  to
          retrieve tag information for.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Tags -> (list)
          An array that lists all the tags that are associated with the appli-
          cation. Each tag consists of a required tag key (Key ) and an  asso-
          ciated tag value (Value ).

          (structure)
              An  object that defines the tags associated with an application.
              A tag is a label that you optionally define and  associate  with
              an  application.  Tags  can  help  you categorize and manage re-
              sources in different ways, such as by purpose,  owner,  environ-
              ment, or other criteria.

              Each  tag  consists  of a required tag key and an associated tag
              value , both of which you define. A tag key is a  general  label
              that  acts  as  a  category for a more specific tag value. A tag
              value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can  con-
              tain  as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many
              as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode  letters,  dig-
              its,  white  space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = +
              -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique  and
                it can have only one value.

              o The  aws:  prefix  is reserved for use by Amazon Web Services;
                you cant use it in any tag keys or values that you define.  In
                addition, you can't edit or remove tag keys or values that use
                this prefix.

              Key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The  maximum
                 length  of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length is
                 1 character.

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The
                 maximum  length of a tag value is 256 characters. The minimum
                 length is 0 characters. If you don't want an  application  to
                 have a specific tag value, don't specify a value for this pa-
                 rameter.
