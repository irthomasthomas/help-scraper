OPTIONS
       --resource-group-name (string)
          The name of the resource group.

       --pattern-set-name (string)
          The name of the log pattern set.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  results to return in a single call. To re-
          trieve the remaining results, make another call  with  the  returned
          NextToken value.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to request the next page of results.

       --account-id (string)
          The AWS account ID for the resource group owner.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ResourceGroupName -> (string)
          The name of the resource group.

       AccountId -> (string)
          The AWS account ID for the resource group owner.

       LogPatterns -> (list)
          The list of log patterns.

          (structure)
              An  object  that defines the log patterns that belongs to a Log-
              PatternSet .

              PatternSetName -> (string)
                 The name of the log pattern. A log pattern name  can  contain
                 as many as 30 characters, and it cannot be empty. The charac-
                 ters can be Unicode letters, digits, or one of the  following
                 symbols: period, dash, underscore.

              PatternName -> (string)
                 The  name  of the log pattern. A log pattern name can contain
                 as many as 50 characters, and it cannot be empty. The charac-
                 ters  can be Unicode letters, digits, or one of the following
                 symbols: period, dash, underscore.

              Pattern -> (string)
                 A regular expression that defines the log pattern. A log pat-
                 tern  can  contain as many as 50 characters, and it cannot be
                 empty. The pattern must be DFA compatible. Patterns that uti-
                 lize forward lookahead or backreference constructions are not
                 supported.

              Rank -> (integer)
                 Rank of the log pattern.  Must  be  a  value  between  1  and
                 1,000,000  . The patterns are sorted by rank, so we recommend
                 that you set your highest priority patterns with  the  lowest
                 rank. A pattern of rank 1 will be the first to get matched to
                 a log line. A pattern of rank 1,000,000 will be last  to  get
                 matched. When you configure custom log patterns from the con-
                 sole, a Low severity pattern translates to a 750,000 rank.  A
                 Medium  severity  pattern translates to a 500,000 rank. And a
                 High severity pattern translates to a 250,000 rank. Rank val-
                 ues  less  than  1 or greater than 1,000,000 are reserved for
                 AWS-provided patterns.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token used to retrieve the next page of results. This  value  is
          null when there are no more results to return.
