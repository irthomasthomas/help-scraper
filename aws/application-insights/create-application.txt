OPTIONS
       --resource-group-name (string)
          The name of the resource group.

       --ops-center-enabled | --no-ops-center-enabled (boolean)
          When  set to true , creates opsItems for any problems detected on an
          application.

       --cwe-monitor-enabled | --no-cwe-monitor-enabled (boolean)
          Indicates whether Application  Insights  can  listen  to  CloudWatch
          events  for the application resources, such as instance terminated ,
          failed deployment , and others.

       --ops-item-sns-topic-arn (string)
          The SNS topic provided to Application Insights that is associated to
          the created opsItem. Allows you to receive notifications for updates
          to the opsItem.

       --tags (list)
          List of tags to add to the application. tag key (Key ) and an  asso-
          ciated  tag  value  (Value ). The maximum length of a tag key is 128
          characters. The maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters.

          (structure)
              An object that defines the tags associated with an  application.
              A  tag  is a label that you optionally define and associate with
              an application. Tags can help  you  categorize  and  manage  re-
              sources  in  different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environ-
              ment, or other criteria.

              Each tag consists of a required tag key and  an  associated  tag
              value  ,  both of which you define. A tag key is a general label
              that acts as a category for a more specific  tag  value.  A  tag
              value  acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can con-
              tain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as  many
              as  256  characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, dig-
              its, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : /  =  +
              -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o For  each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and
                it can have only one value.

              o The aws: prefix is reserved for use by AWS; you cant use it in
                any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can't
                edit or remove tag keys or values that use this prefix.

              Key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The  maximum
                 length  of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length is
                 1 character.

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The
                 maximum  length of a tag value is 256 characters. The minimum
                 length is 0 characters. If you don't want an  application  to
                 have a specific tag value, don't specify a value for this pa-
                 rameter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --auto-config-enabled | --no-auto-config-enabled (boolean)
          Indicates whether Application Insights automatically configures  un-
          monitored resources in the resource group.

       --auto-create | --no-auto-create (boolean)
          Configures  all  of  the resources in the resource group by applying
          the recommended configurations.

       --grouping-type (string)
          Application Insights can create applications  based  on  a  resource
          group or on an account. To create an account-based application using
          all of the resources in the  account,  set  this  parameter  to  AC-
          COUNT_BASED .

          Possible values:

          o ACCOUNT_BASED

       --attach-missing-permission | --no-attach-missing-permission (boolean)
          If set to true, the managed policies for SSM and CW will be attached
          to the instance roles if they are missing.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
