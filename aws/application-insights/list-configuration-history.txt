OPTIONS
       --resource-group-name (string)
          Resource group to which the application belongs.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start time of the event.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end time of the event.

       --event-status (string)
          The  status  of  the configuration update event. Possible values in-
          clude INFO, WARN, and ERROR.

          Possible values:

          o INFO

          o WARN

          o ERROR

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results returned  by  ListConfigurationHistory
          in  paginated  output.  When  this parameter is used, ListConfigura-
          tionHistory returns only MaxResults in a single page  along  with  a
          NextToken response element. The remaining results of the initial re-
          quest can be seen by sending  another  ListConfigurationHistory  re-
          quest  with  the  returned NextToken value. If this parameter is not
          used, then ListConfigurationHistory returns all results.

       --next-token (string)
          The NextToken value returned from a previous paginated  ListConfigu-
          rationHistory  request where MaxResults was used and the results ex-
          ceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination  continues  from  the
          end  of the previous results that returned the NextToken value. This
          value is null when there are no more results to return.

       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID for the resource group owner.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       EventList -> (list)
          The list of configuration events and their corresponding details.

              The event information.

              ResourceGroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the resource group of the  application  to  which
                 the configuration event belongs.

                 plication to which the configuration event belongs.

              MonitoredResourceARN -> (string)
                 The resource monitored by Application Insights.

              EventStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the configuration update event. Possible values
                 include INFO, WARN, and ERROR.

              EventResourceType -> (string)
                 The resource type that Application Insights attempted to con-
                 figure, for example, CLOUDWATCH_ALARM.

              EventTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp of the event.

              EventDetail -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  NextToken value to include in a future ListConfigurationHistory
          request. When the results of a ListConfigurationHistory request  ex-
          ceed  MaxResults  , this value can be used to retrieve the next page
          of results. This value is null when there are no more results to re-
          turn.
