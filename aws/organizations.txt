          Endpoint to call When using the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDK

       For the current release of Organizations, specify the us-east-1  region
       for  all Amazon Web Services API and CLI calls made from the commercial
       Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China. If calling  from  one  of
       the Amazon Web Services Regions in China, then specify cn-northwest-1 .
       You can do this in the CLI by using these parameters and commands:

       o Use the following parameter with each command  to  specify  both  the
         endpoint    and   its   region:    --endpoint-url   https://organiza-
         tions.us-east-1.amazonaws.com  (from commercial Amazon  Web  Services
         Regions  outside  of  China)    or   --endpoint-url https://organiza-
         tions.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn  (from Amazon Web Services  Re-
         gions in China)

       o Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with this
         command:  aws configure set default.region us-east-1   (from  commer-
         cial  Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)   or  aws config-
         ure set default.region cn-northwest-1  (from Amazon Web Services  Re-
         gions in China)

       o Use  the  following  parameter  with each command to specify the end-
         point:  --region us-east-1  (from commercial Amazon Web Services  Re-
         gions  outside  of China)   or  --region cn-northwest-1  (from Amazon
         Web Services Regions in China)
          Recording API Requests

       Organizations supports CloudTrail, a service that  records  Amazon  Web
       Services  API  calls  for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers
       log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By  using  information  collected  by
       CloudTrail,  you can determine which requests the Organizations service
       received, who made the request and when, and so on. For more about  Or-
       ganizations  and  its support for CloudTrail, see Logging Organizations
       Events with CloudTrail in the Organizations User Guide . To learn  more
       about  CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files,
       see the CloudTrail User Guide .
