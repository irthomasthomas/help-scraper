NAME
       create-observability-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Create  an  App Runner observability configuration resource. App Runner
       requires this resource when you create or update  App  Runner  services
       and  you  want  to  enable  non-default observability features. You can
       share an observability configuration across multiple services.

       Create multiple revisions of a configuration  by  calling  this  action
       multiple times using the same ObservabilityConfigurationName . The call
       returns incremental ObservabilityConfigurationRevision values. When you
       create a service and configure an observability configuration resource,
       the service uses the latest active revision of the  observability  con-
       figuration  by default. You can optionally configure the service to use
       a specific revision.

       The observability configuration resource is designed to configure  mul-
       tiple  features (currently one feature, tracing). This action takes op-
       tional parameters that describe the  configuration  of  these  features
       (currently  one parameter, TraceConfiguration ). If you don't specify a
       feature parameter, App Runner doesn't enable the feature.

OPTIONS
       --observability-configuration-name (string)
          A name for the observability configuration. When you use it for  the
          first  time in an Amazon Web Services Region, App Runner creates re-
          vision number 1 of this name. When you use the same name  in  subse-
          quent calls, App Runner creates incremental revisions of the config-
          uration.

          NOTE:
              The name DefaultConfiguration is reserved. You can't use  it  to
              create a new observability configuration, and you can't create a
              revision of it.

              When you want to use your own  observability  configuration  for
              your App Runner service, create a configuration with a different
              name , and then provide it when you create or update  your  ser-
              vice.

       --trace-configuration (structure)
          The  configuration  of the tracing feature within this observability
          configuration. If you don't specify it, App  Runner  doesn't  enable
          tracing.

          Vendor -> (string)
              The  implementation  provider chosen for tracing App Runner ser-
              vices.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Vendor=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Vendor": "AWSXRAY"
          }

       --tags (list)
          A list of metadata items that you can associate  with  your  observ-
          ability configuration resource. A tag is a key-value pair.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag that is applied to an App Runner resource. A tag
              is a metadata item consisting of a key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ObservabilityConfiguration -> (structure)
          A  description  of the App Runner observability configuration that's
          created by this request.

              tion.

          ObservabilityConfigurationName -> (string)
              The  customer-provided  observability configuration name. It can
              be used in multiple revisions of a configuration.

          TraceConfiguration -> (structure)
              The configuration of the tracing feature within this observabil-
              ity configuration. If not specified, tracing isn't enabled.

              Vendor -> (string)
                 The  implementation  provider  chosen  for tracing App Runner
                 services.

          ObservabilityConfigurationRevision -> (integer)
              The revision of this observability  configuration.  It's  unique
              among  all  the active configurations ("Status": "ACTIVE" ) that
              share the same ObservabilityConfigurationName .

          Latest -> (boolean)

              nently removed some time after they are deleted.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  time when the observability configuration was created. It's
              in Unix time stamp format.
