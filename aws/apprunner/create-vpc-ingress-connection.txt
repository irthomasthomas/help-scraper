OPTIONS
       --service-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) for this App Runner service that is
          used to create the VPC Ingress Connection resource.

       --vpc-ingress-connection-name (string)
          A name for the VPC Ingress Connection resource. It  must  be  unique
          across  all  the  active  VPC Ingress Connections in your Amazon Web
          Services account in the Amazon Web Services Region.

       --ingress-vpc-configuration (structure)
          Specifications for the customers Amazon VPC and the  related  Amazon
          Web  Services  PrivateLink  VPC endpoint that are used to create the
          VPC Ingress Connection resource.

          VpcId -> (string)
              The ID of the VPC that is used for the VPC endpoint.

          VpcEndpointId -> (string)
              The ID of the VPC endpoint that your App Runner service connects
              to.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          VpcId=string,VpcEndpointId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "VpcId": "string",
            "VpcEndpointId": "string"
          }

       --tags (list)
          An  optional  list of metadata items that you can associate with the
          VPC Ingress Connection resource. A tag is a key-value pair.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag that is applied to an App Runner resource. A tag
              is a metadata item consisting of a key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON

       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
