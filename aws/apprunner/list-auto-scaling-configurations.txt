NAME
       list-auto-scaling-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of active App Runner automatic scaling configurations in
       your Amazon Web Services account. You can query  the  revisions  for  a
       specific  configuration name or the revisions for all active configura-
       tions in your account. You can optionally query only the  latest  revi-
       sion of each requested name.

       To  retrieve a full description of a particular configuration revision,
       call and provide one of the ARNs returned by  ListAutoScalingConfigura-
       tions .

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-configuration-name (string)
          The  name of the App Runner auto scaling configuration that you want
          to list. If specified, App Runner lists revisions  that  share  this
          name.  If  not specified, App Runner returns revisions of all active
          configurations.

       --latest-only | --no-latest-only (boolean)
          Set to true to list only the latest revision for each requested con-
          figuration name.

          Set  to false to list all revisions for each requested configuration
          name.

          Default: true

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to include in  each  response  (result
          page). It's used for a paginated request.

          If  you  don't specify MaxResults , the request retrieves all avail-
          able results in a single response.

       --next-token (string)
          A token from a previous result page. It's used for a  paginated  re-
          quest. The request retrieves the next result page. All other parame-
          ter values must be identical to the ones that are specified  in  the
          initial request.

          If you don't specify NextToken , the request retrieves the first re-
          sult page.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get a paginated listing of App Runner auto scaling configurations

       The following list-auto-scaling-configurations example  lists  all  App
       Runner  auto  scaling  configurations  in your AWS account.  Up to five
       auto scaling configurations are listed in each  response.  AutoScaling-
       ConfigurationName  and  LatestOnly  aren't  specified.   Their defaults
       cause the latest revision of all active configurations to be listed.

       In this example, the response includes two results and there aren't ad-
       ditional ones, so no NextToken is returned.

          }

OUTPUT
       AutoScalingConfigurationSummaryList -> (list)
          A  list  of  summary information records for auto scaling configura-
          tions. In a paginated request, the request returns up to  MaxResults
          records for each call.

          (structure)
              Provides summary information about an App Runner automatic scal-
              ing configuration resource.

              This type contains limited information  about  an  auto  scaling
              configuration.  It  includes  only  identification  information,
              without configuration details. It's  returned  by  the   ListAu-
              toScalingConfigurations  action. Complete configuration informa-
              tion is returned by the  CreateAutoScalingConfiguration  ,   De-
              scribeAutoScalingConfiguration  , and  DeleteAutoScalingConfigu-
              ration actions using the  AutoScalingConfiguration type.

              AutoScalingConfigurationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this auto scaling  configu-
                 ration.

              AutoScalingConfigurationName -> (string)
                 The customer-provided auto scaling configuration name. It can
                 be used in multiple revisions of a configuration.

              AutoScalingConfigurationRevision -> (integer)
                 The revision of this auto scaling configuration. It's  unique
                 among  all  the  active  configurations ("Status": "ACTIVE" )
                 with the same AutoScalingConfigurationName .

              Status -> (string)
                 The current state of the auto scaling configuration.  If  the
                 status  of  a  configuration  revision  is  INACTIVE , it was
                 deleted and can't be used. Inactive  configuration  revisions
                 are permanently removed some time after they are deleted.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  when  the  auto scaling configuration was created.
                 It's in Unix time stamp format.

              HasAssociatedService -> (boolean)
                 Indicates if this auto scaling configuration has an App  Run-
                 ner service associated with it. A value of true indicates one
                 or more services are associated. A value of  false  indicates
                 no services are associated.

              IsDefault -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  if  this auto scaling configuration should be used
                 as the default for a new App Runner  service  that  does  not
                 have  an auto scaling configuration ARN specified during cre-
                 ation. Each account can have only one default AutoScalingCon-
                 figuration  per  region. The default AutoScalingConfiguration
                 can be any  revision  under  the  same  AutoScalingConfigura-
                 tionName .

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token that you can pass in a subsequent request to get the next
          result page. It's returned in a paginated request.
