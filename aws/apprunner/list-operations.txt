NAME
       list-operations -

DESCRIPTION
       Return a list of operations that occurred on an App Runner service.

       The  resulting  list  of  OperationSummary objects is sorted in reverse
       chronological order. The first object on the list represents  the  last
       started operation.

OPTIONS
       --service-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the App Runner service that you
          want a list of operations for.

       --next-token (string)
          A token from a previous result page. It's used for a  paginated  re-
          quest. The request retrieves the next result page. All other parame-
          ter values must be identical to the ones specified  in  the  initial
          request.

          If you don't specify NextToken , the request retrieves the first re-
          sult page.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to include in  each  response  (result
          page). It's used for a paginated request.

          If  you  don't specify MaxResults , the request retrieves all avail-
          able results in a single response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list operations that occurred on a servicee

       The  following  list-operations  example  lists all operations that oc-
       curred on an App Runner service so far.  In this example,  the  service
       is new and only a single operation of type CREATE_SERVICE has occurred.

          aws apprunner list-operations \
              --cli-input-json file://input.json

       Contents of input.json:

          {
              "ServiceArn": "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:service/python-app/8fe1e10304f84fd2b0df550fe98a71fa"
          }

       Output:

          {
              "OperationSummaryList": [
                  {
                      "EndedAt": 1606156217,
                      "Id": "17fe9f55-7e91-4097-b243-fcabbb69a4cf",

                      "Status": "SUCCEEDED",
                      "TargetArn": "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:service/python-app/8fe1e10304f84fd2b0df550fe98a71fa",
                      "Type": "CREATE_SERVICE",

              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       OperationSummaryList -> (list)
          A  list of operation summary information records. In a paginated re-
          quest, the request returns up to MaxResults records for each call.

          (structure)

                 A  unique  ID  of this operation. It's unique in the scope of
                 the App Runner service.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of operation. It indicates a  specific  action  that
                 occured.

                 The current state of the operation.

              TargetArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource that the oper-
                 ation acted on (for example, an App Runner service).

              StartedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the operation started. It's in  the  Unix  time
                 stamp format.

              EndedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  when  the  operation  ended. It's in the Unix time
                 stamp format.

              UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the operation was last  updated.  It's  in  the
                 Unix time stamp format.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token that you can pass in a subsequent request to get the next
          result page. It's returned in a paginated request.
