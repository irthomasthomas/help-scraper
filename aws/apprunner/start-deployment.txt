START-DEPLOYMENT()                                          START-DEPLOYMENT()



NAME
       start-deployment -

DESCRIPTION
       Initiate  a  manual  deployment  of  the latest commit in a source code
       repository or the latest image in a source image repository to  an  App
       Runner service.

       For  a  source  code  repository,  App  Runner retrieves the commit and
       builds a Docker image. For a source image repository,  App  Runner  re-
       trieves the latest Docker image. In both cases, App Runner then deploys
       the new image to your service and starts a new container instance.

       This is an asynchronous operation. On a successful call,  you  can  use
       the  returned OperationId and the  ListOperations call to track the op-
       eration's progress.

          --service-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the App Runner  service  that  you
          want to manually deploy to.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To initiate a manual deployment

       The  following start-deployment example performs a manual deployment to
       an App Runner service.

          aws apprunner start-deployment \
              --cli-input-json file://input.json

       Contents of input.json:

          {
              "ServiceArn": "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:service/python-app/8fe1e10304f84fd2b0df550fe98a71fa"
          }

       Output:

          {
              "OperationId": "853a7d5b-fc9f-4730-831b-fd8037ab832a"
          }

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          The unique ID  of  the  asynchronous  operation  that  this  request
          started.  You  can  use it combined with the  ListOperations call to
          track the operation's progress.
