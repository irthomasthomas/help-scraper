       cally.

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-configuration-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the App Runner auto scaling con-
          figuration that you want to set as the default.

          The ARN can be a full auto scaling configuration ARN, or  a  partial
          ARN ending with either
          ``
          .../name `` or
          ``
          .../name  /revision  ``  . If a revision isn't specified, the latest
          active revision is set as the default.

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 64)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 64)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       AutoScalingConfiguration -> (structure)
          A description of the App Runner auto scaling configuration that  was
          set as default.

          AutoScalingConfigurationArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of this auto scaling configura-
              tion.

          AutoScalingConfigurationName -> (string)
              The customer-provided auto scaling configuration name. It can be
              used in multiple revisions of a configuration.

          AutoScalingConfigurationRevision -> (integer)
              The  revision  of  this  auto scaling configuration. It's unique
              among all the active configurations ("Status": "ACTIVE"  )  that
              share the same AutoScalingConfigurationName .

          Latest -> (boolean)
              It's set to true for the configuration with the highest Revision
              among all configurations that share the same AutoScalingConfigu-
              rationName . It's set to false otherwise.

          Status -> (string)
              The current state of the auto scaling configuration. If the sta-
              tus of a configuration revision is INACTIVE , it was deleted and
              can't  be used. Inactive configuration revisions are permanently
              removed some time after they are deleted.

          MaxConcurrency -> (integer)
              The maximum number of concurrent requests that an instance  pro-
              cesses. If the number of concurrent requests exceeds this limit,
              App Runner scales the service up.

          MinSize -> (integer)
              The minimum number of instances that App Runner provisions for a
              service. The service always has at least MinSize provisioned in-
              stances. Some of them actively serve traffic. The rest  of  them
              (provisioned  and  inactive instances) are a cost-effective com-
              pute capacity reserve and are ready to be quickly activated. You
              pay  for  memory usage of all the provisioned instances. You pay
              for CPU usage of only the active subset.

              App Runner temporarily doubles the  number  of  provisioned  in-
              stances  during  deployments,  to maintain the same capacity for
              both old and new code.

          MaxSize -> (integer)
              The maximum number of instances that a service scales up to.  At
              most MaxSize instances actively serve traffic for your service.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  time  when the auto scaling configuration was created. It's
              in Unix time stamp format.

          DeletedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time when the auto scaling configuration was  deleted.  It's
              in Unix time stamp format.

          HasAssociatedService -> (boolean)
              Indicates  if  this auto scaling configuration has an App Runner
              service associated with it. A value of  true  indicates  one  or
              more services are associated. A value of false indicates no ser-
              vices are associated.

          IsDefault -> (boolean)
              Indicates if this auto scaling configuration should be  used  as
              the  default  for a new App Runner service that does not have an
              auto scaling configuration ARN specified during  creation.  Each
              account  can  have only one default AutoScalingConfiguration per
              region. The default AutoScalingConfiguration can be any revision
              under the same AutoScalingConfigurationName .
