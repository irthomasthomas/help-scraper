OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to include in  each  response  (result
          page). It's used for a paginated request.

          If  you  don't specify MaxResults , the request retrieves all avail-
          able results in a single response.

       --next-token (string)
          A token from a previous result page. It's used for a  paginated  re-
          quest. The request retrieves the next result page. All other parame-
          ter values must be identical to the ones that are specified  in  the
          initial request.

          If you don't specify NextToken , the request retrieves the first re-
          sult page.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       VpcConnectors -> (list)
          A list of information records for VPC connectors. In a paginated re-
          quest, the request returns up to MaxResults records for each call.

          (structure)
              Describes an App Runner VPC connector resource. A VPC  connector
              describes  the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) that an
              App Runner service is associated with, and the subnets and secu-
              rity group that are used.

              Multiple  revisions  of a connector might have the same Name and
              different Revision values.

              NOTE:
                 At this time, App Runner supports only one revision per name.

              VpcConnectorName -> (string)
                 The customer-provided VPC connector name.

              VpcConnectorArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this VPC connector.

              VpcConnectorRevision -> (integer)
                 The revision of this VPC connector. It's unique among all the
                 active  connectors  ("Status": "ACTIVE" ) that share the same
                 Name .

                 NOTE:
                     At this time, App Runner supports only one  revision  per
                     name.

              Subnets -> (list)
                 A  list  of IDs of subnets that App Runner uses for your ser-
                 vice. All IDs are of subnets of a single Amazon VPC.

                 (string)

              SecurityGroups -> (list)
                 A list of IDs of security groups that App Runner uses for ac-
                 cess  to  Amazon  Web  Services resources under the specified
                 subnets. If not specified, App Runner uses the default  secu-
                 rity  group of the Amazon VPC. The default security group al-
                 lows all outbound traffic.

                 (string)

              Status -> (string)
                 The current state of the VPC connector. If the  status  of  a
                 connector  revision is INACTIVE , it was deleted and can't be
                 used. Inactive connector revisions  are  permanently  removed
                 some time after they are deleted.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  when  the  VPC connector was created. It's in Unix
                 time stamp format.

              DeletedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the VPC connector was  deleted.  It's  in  Unix
                 time stamp format.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token that you can pass in a subsequent request to get the next
          result page. It's returned in a paginated request.
