OPTIONS
       --vpc-ingress-connection-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (Arn) for the App Runner VPC Ingress Con-
          nection resource that you want to update.

       --ingress-vpc-configuration (structure)
          Specifications for the customers Amazon VPC and the  related  Amazon
          Web  Services  PrivateLink  VPC endpoint that are used to update the
          VPC Ingress Connection resource.

          VpcId -> (string)
              The ID of the VPC that is used for the VPC endpoint.

          VpcEndpointId -> (string)
              The ID of the VPC endpoint that your App Runner service connects
              to.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          VpcId=string,VpcEndpointId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "VpcId": "string",
            "VpcEndpointId": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
