NAME
       create-vpc-connector -

DESCRIPTION
       Create  an  App Runner VPC connector resource. App Runner requires this
       resource when you want to associate your App Runner service to a custom
       Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).

OPTIONS
       --vpc-connector-name (string)
          A name for the VPC connector.

       --subnets (list)
          A  list  of  IDs of subnets that App Runner should use when it asso-
          ciates your service with a custom Amazon VPC. Specify IDs of subnets
          of  a  single  Amazon VPC. App Runner determines the Amazon VPC from
          the subnets you specify.

          NOTE:
              App Runner currently only provides support for IPv4.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --security-groups (list)
          A list of IDs of security groups that App Runner should use for  ac-
          cess  to  Amazon Web Services resources under the specified subnets.
          If not specified, App Runner uses the default security group of  the
          Amazon VPC. The default security group allows all outbound traffic.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of metadata items that you can associate with your VPC con-
          nector resource. A tag is a key-value pair.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag that is applied to an App Runner resource. A tag
              is a metadata item consisting of a key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       VpcConnector -> (structure)
          A description of the App Runner VPC connector that's created by this
          request.

          VpcConnectorName -> (string)
              The customer-provided VPC connector name.

          VpcConnectorArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this VPC connector.

          VpcConnectorRevision -> (integer)
              The revision of this VPC connector. It's unique  among  all  the
              active connectors ("Status": "ACTIVE" ) that share the same Name
              .

              NOTE:
                 At this time, App Runner supports only one revision per name.

          Subnets -> (list)
              A list of IDs of subnets that App Runner uses for your  service.
              All IDs are of subnets of a single Amazon VPC.

              (string)

          SecurityGroups -> (list)
              A list of IDs of security groups that App Runner uses for access
              to Amazon Web Services resources under the specified subnets. If
              not specified, App Runner uses the default security group of the
              Amazon VPC. The default security group allows all outbound traf-
              fic.

              (string)

          Status -> (string)
              The  current state of the VPC connector. If the status of a con-
              nector revision is INACTIVE , it was deleted and can't be  used.
              Inactive  connector  revisions are permanently removed some time
              after they are deleted.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time when the VPC connector was created. It's in  Unix  time
              stamp format.

          DeletedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  time  when the VPC connector was deleted. It's in Unix time
              stamp format.
