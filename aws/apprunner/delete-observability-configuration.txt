OPTIONS
       --observability-configuration-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the App Runner observability con-
          figuration that you want to delete.

          The ARN can be a full observability configuration ARN, or a  partial
          ARN ending with either
          ``
          .../name `` or
          ``
          .../name  /revision  ``  . If a revision isn't specified, the latest
          active revision is deleted.

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 64)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 64)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ObservabilityConfiguration -> (structure)
          A description of the App  Runner  observability  configuration  that
          this request just deleted.

          ObservabilityConfigurationArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this observability configura-
              tion.

          ObservabilityConfigurationName -> (string)
              The customer-provided observability configuration name.  It  can
              be used in multiple revisions of a configuration.

          TraceConfiguration -> (structure)
              The configuration of the tracing feature within this observabil-
              ity configuration. If not specified, tracing isn't enabled.

              Vendor -> (string)
                 The implementation provider chosen  for  tracing  App  Runner
                 services.

          ObservabilityConfigurationRevision -> (integer)
              The  revision  of  this observability configuration. It's unique
              among all the active configurations ("Status": "ACTIVE"  )  that
              share the same ObservabilityConfigurationName .

          Latest -> (boolean)
              It's set to true for the configuration with the highest Revision
              among all configurations that share the  same  ObservabilityCon-
              figurationName . It's set to false otherwise.

          Status -> (string)
              The  current  state  of  the observability configuration. If the
              status of a configuration revision is INACTIVE , it was  deleted
              and  can't  be used. Inactive configuration revisions are perma-
              nently removed some time after they are deleted.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time when the observability configuration was created.  It's
              in Unix time stamp format.

          DeletedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  time when the observability configuration was deleted. It's
              in Unix time stamp format.
