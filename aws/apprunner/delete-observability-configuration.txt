NAME
       delete-observability-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Delete  an  App  Runner  observability  configuration resource. You can
       delete a specific revision or the latest  active  revision.  You  can't
       delete a configuration that's used by one or more App Runner services.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-observability-configuration
          --observability-configuration-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --observability-configuration-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the App Runner observability con-
          figuration that you want to delete.

          The ARN can be a full observability configuration ARN, or a  partial
          ARN ending with either
          ``
          .../name `` or
          ``
          .../name  /revision  ``  . If a revision isn't specified, the latest
          active revision is deleted.

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 52)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 52)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ObservabilityConfiguration -> (structure)
          A  description  of  the  App Runner observability configuration that
          this request just deleted.

          ObservabilityConfigurationArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this observability  configura-
              tion.

          ObservabilityConfigurationName -> (string)
              The  customer-provided  observability configuration name. It can
              be used in multiple revisions of a configuration.

          TraceConfiguration -> (structure)
              The configuration of the tracing feature within this observabil-
              ity configuration. If not specified, tracing isn't enabled.

              Vendor -> (string)
                 The  implementation  provider  chosen  for tracing App Runner
                 services.

          ObservabilityConfigurationRevision -> (integer)
              The revision of this observability  configuration.  It's  unique
              among  all  the active configurations ("Status": "ACTIVE" ) that
              share the same ObservabilityConfigurationName .

          Latest -> (boolean)
              It's set to true for the configuration with the highest Revision
              among  all  configurations that share the same ObservabilityCon-
              figurationName . It's set to false otherwise.

          Status -> (string)
              The current state of the  observability  configuration.  If  the
              status  of a configuration revision is INACTIVE , it was deleted
              and can't be used. Inactive configuration revisions  are  perma-
              nently removed some time after they are deleted.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  time when the observability configuration was created. It's
              in Unix time stamp format.

          DeletedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time when the observability configuration was deleted.  It's
              in Unix time stamp format.
