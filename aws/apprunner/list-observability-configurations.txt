NAME
       list-observability-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  active App Runner observability configurations in
       your Amazon Web Services account. You can query  the  revisions  for  a
       specific  configuration name or the revisions for all active configura-
       tions in your account. You can optionally query only the  latest  revi-
       sion of each requested name.

       To  retrieve a full description of a particular configuration revision,
       call and provide one of the ARNs returned by  ListObservabilityConfigu-
       rations .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-observability-configurations
          [--observability-configuration-name <value>]
          [--latest-only | --no-latest-only]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --observability-configuration-name (string)
          The name of the App Runner observability configuration that you want
          to list. If specified, App Runner lists revisions  that  share  this
          name.  If  not specified, App Runner returns revisions of all active
          configurations.

       --latest-only | --no-latest-only (boolean)
          Set to true to list only the latest revision for each requested con-
          figuration name.

          Set  to false to list all revisions for each requested configuration
          name.

          Default: true

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to include in  each  response  (result
          page). It's used for a paginated request.

          If  you  don't specify MaxResults , the request retrieves all avail-
          able results in a single response.

       --next-token (string)
          A token from a previous result page. It's used for a  paginated  re-
          quest. The request retrieves the next result page. All other parame-
          ter values must be identical to the ones that are specified  in  the
          initial request.

          If you don't specify NextToken , the request retrieves the first re-
          sult page.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ObservabilityConfigurationSummaryList -> (list)
          A  list  of summary information records for observability configura-
          tions. In a paginated request, the request returns up to  MaxResults
          records for each call.

          (structure)
              Provides  summary  information about an App Runner observability
              configuration resource.

              This type contains limited information  about  an  observability
              configuration.  It  includes  only  identification  information,
              without configuration details. It's returned by the  ListObserv-
              abilityConfigurations action. Complete configuration information
              is returned  by  the   CreateObservabilityConfiguration  ,   De-
              scribeObservabilityConfiguration  , and  DeleteObservabilityCon-
              figuration actions using the  ObservabilityConfiguration type.

              ObservabilityConfigurationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this observability configu-
                 ration.

              ObservabilityConfigurationName -> (string)
                 The  customer-provided  observability  configuration name. It
                 can be used in multiple revisions of a configuration.

              ObservabilityConfigurationRevision -> (integer)
                 The revision of this observability configuration. It's unique
                 among  all  the  active  configurations ("Status": "ACTIVE" )
                 that share the same ObservabilityConfigurationName .

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token that you can pass in a subsequent request to get the  next
          result page. It's returned in a paginated request.
