OPTIONS
       --observability-configuration-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the App Runner observability  con-
          figuration that you want a description for.

          The  ARN can be a full observability configuration ARN, or a partial
          ARN ending with either
          ``
          .../name `` or
          ``
          .../name /revision `` . If a revision isn't  specified,  the  latest
          active revision is described.

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 64)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 64)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ObservabilityConfiguration -> (structure)
          A  full  description  of  the App Runner observability configuration
          that you specified in this request.

          ObservabilityConfigurationArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this observability  configura-
              tion.

          ObservabilityConfigurationName -> (string)
              The  customer-provided  observability configuration name. It can
              be used in multiple revisions of a configuration.

          TraceConfiguration -> (structure)
              The configuration of the tracing feature within this observabil-
              ity configuration. If not specified, tracing isn't enabled.

              Vendor -> (string)
                 The  implementation  provider  chosen  for tracing App Runner
                 services.

          ObservabilityConfigurationRevision -> (integer)
              The revision of this observability  configuration.  It's  unique
              among  all  the active configurations ("Status": "ACTIVE" ) that
              share the same ObservabilityConfigurationName .

          Latest -> (boolean)
              It's set to true for the configuration with the highest Revision
              among  all  configurations that share the same ObservabilityCon-
              figurationName . It's set to false otherwise.

          Status -> (string)
              The current state of the  observability  configuration.  If  the
              status  of a configuration revision is INACTIVE , it was deleted
              and can't be used. Inactive configuration revisions  are  perma-
              nently removed some time after they are deleted.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  time when the observability configuration was created. It's
              in Unix time stamp format.

          DeletedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time when the observability configuration was deleted.  It's
              in Unix time stamp format.
