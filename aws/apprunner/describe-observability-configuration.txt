NAME
       describe-observability-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Return  a full description of an App Runner observability configuration
       resource.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-observability-configuration
          --observability-configuration-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --observability-configuration-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the App Runner observability  con-
          figuration that you want a description for.

          The  ARN can be a full observability configuration ARN, or a partial
          ARN ending with either
          ``
          .../name `` or
          ``
          .../name /revision `` . If a revision isn't  specified,  the  latest
          active revision is described.

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 52)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 52)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ObservabilityConfiguration -> (structure)
          A full description of the  App  Runner  observability  configuration
          that you specified in this request.

          ObservabilityConfigurationArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this observability configura-
              tion.

          ObservabilityConfigurationName -> (string)
              The customer-provided observability configuration name.  It  can
              be used in multiple revisions of a configuration.

          TraceConfiguration -> (structure)
              The configuration of the tracing feature within this observabil-
              ity configuration. If not specified, tracing isn't enabled.

              Vendor -> (string)
                 The implementation provider chosen  for  tracing  App  Runner
                 services.

          ObservabilityConfigurationRevision -> (integer)
              The  revision  of  this observability configuration. It's unique
              among all the active configurations ("Status": "ACTIVE"  )  that
              share the same ObservabilityConfigurationName .

          Latest -> (boolean)
              It's set to true for the configuration with the highest Revision
              among all configurations that share the  same  ObservabilityCon-
              figurationName . It's set to false otherwise.

          Status -> (string)
              The  current  state  of  the observability configuration. If the
              status of a configuration revision is INACTIVE , it was  deleted
              and  can't  be used. Inactive configuration revisions are perma-
              nently removed some time after they are deleted.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time when the observability configuration was created.  It's
              in Unix time stamp format.

          DeletedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  time when the observability configuration was deleted. It's
              in Unix time stamp format.
