OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A token from a previous result page. Used for a  paginated  request.
          The request retrieves the next result page. All other parameter val-
          ues must be identical to the ones specified in the initial request.

          If you don't specify NextToken , the request retrieves the first re-
          sult page.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of results to include in each response (result
          page). It's used for a paginated request.

          If you don't specify MaxResults , the request retrieves  all  avail-
          able results in a single response.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get a paginated listing of App Runner services

       The  following  list-services  example lists all App Runner services in
       the AWS account. Up to two services are listed in each response.   This
       example  shows the first request. The response includes two results and
       a token that can be used in the next request.  When  a  subsequent  re-
       sponse doesn't include a token, all services have been listed.

OUTPUT
       ServiceSummaryList -> (list)
          A  list  of  service summary information records. In a paginated re-
          quest, the request returns up to MaxResults records for each call.

          (structure)
              Provides summary information for an App Runner service.

              This type contains  limited  information  about  a  service.  It
              doesn't  include  configuration  details.  It's  returned by the
              ListServices action. Complete service information is returned by
              the  CreateService , DescribeService , and DeleteService actions
              using the Service type.

              ServiceName -> (string)
                 The customer-provided service name.

              ServiceId -> (string)
                 An ID that App Runner generated for this service. It's unique
                 within the Amazon Web Services Region.

              ServiceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this service.

              ServiceUrl -> (string)
                 A  subdomain  URL that App Runner generated for this service.
                 You can use this URL to access your service web application.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the App Runner service was created. It's in the
                 Unix time stamp format.

              UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  when the App Runner service was last updated. It's
                 in theUnix time stamp format.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current state of the App Runner service. These particular
                 values mean the following.

                 o CREATE_FAILED   The  service  failed  to create. The failed
                   service isn't usable, and still counts towards your service
                   quota.  To  troubleshoot  this  failure,  read  the failure
                   events and logs, change any  parameters  that  need  to  be
                   fixed, and rebuild your service using UpdateService .

                 o DELETE_FAILED   The  service  failed to delete and can't be
                   successfully recovered. Retry the service deletion call  to
                   ensure that all related resources are removed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token that you can pass in a subsequent request to get the next
          result page. It's returned in a paginated request.
