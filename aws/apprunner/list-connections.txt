OPTIONS
       --connection-name (string)
          If specified, only this connection is returned.  If  not  specified,
          the result isn't filtered by name.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of results to include in each response (result
          page). Used for a paginated request.

          If you don't specify MaxResults , the request retrieves  all  avail-
          able results in a single response.

       --next-token (string)
          A  token  from a previous result page. Used for a paginated request.
          The request retrieves the next result page. All other parameter val-
          ues must be identical to the ones specified in the initial request.

          If you don't specify NextToken , the request retrieves the first re-
          sult page.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To list all connections

       The following list-connections example lists all App Runner connections
       in the AWS account.

          aws apprunner list-connections

       Output:

          {
              "ConnectionSummaryList": [
                  {
                      "ConnectionArn": "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:connection/my-github-connection",
                      "ConnectionName": "my-github-connection",

       Example 2: To list a connection by name

       The following list-connections example lists a connection by its name.

          aws apprunner list-connections \
              --cli-input-json file://input.json

       Contents of input.json:

          {
              "ConnectionName": "my-github-org-connection"
          }

       Output:

          {
              "ConnectionSummaryList": [
                  {
                      "ConnectionArn": "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:connection/my-github-org-connection",

                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       ConnectionSummaryList -> (list)
          A  list  of  summary information records for connections. In a pagi-
          nated request, the request returns up to MaxResults records for each
          call.

          (structure)
              Provides  summary information about an App Runner connection re-
              source.

              ConnectionName -> (string)
                 The customer-provided connection name.

              ConnectionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this connection.

              ProviderType -> (string)

              Status -> (string)
                 The current state of the  App  Runner  connection.  When  the
                 state  is AVAILABLE , you can use the connection to create an
                 App Runner service.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The App Runner connection creation time, expressed as a  Unix
                 time stamp.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token that you can pass in a subsequent request to get the next
          result page. Returned in a paginated request.
