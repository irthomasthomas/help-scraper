DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          Powered by Amazon Bedrock : Amazon Web Services implements automated
          abuse detection . Because Amazon Q in Connect  is  built  on  Amazon
          Bedrock,  users  can take full advantage of the controls implemented
          in Amazon Bedrock to enforce safety, security, and  the  responsible
          use of artificial intelligence (AI).

       Amazon  Q  in Connect is a generative AI customer service assistant. It
       is an LLM-enhanced evolution of Amazon  Connect  Wisdom  that  delivers
       real-time  recommendations  to  help contact center agents resolve cus-
       tomer issues quickly and accurately.

       Amazon Q in Connect automatically detects customer intent during  calls
       and  chats  using  conversational analytics and natural language under-
       standing (NLU). It then provides agents with immediate, real-time  gen-
       erative  responses  and  suggested actions, and links to relevant docu-
       ments and articles. Agents can also query Amazon Q in Connect  directly
       using natural language or keywords to answer customer requests.

       Use the Amazon Q in Connect APIs to create an assistant and a knowledge
       base, for example, or manage content by uploading custom files.

       For more information, see Use Amazon Q in  Connect  for  generative  AI
       powered agent assistance in real-time in the Amazon Connect Administra-
       tor Guide .
