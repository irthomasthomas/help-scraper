LIST-LINUX-SUBSCRIPTIONS()                          LIST-LINUX-SUBSCRIPTIONS()



NAME
       list-linux-subscriptions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  Linux  subscriptions that have been discovered. If you have
       linked your organization, the returned results will include data aggre-
       gated across your accounts in Organizations.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-linux-subscriptions  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: Subscriptions

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An array of structures that you can use to  filter  the  results  to
          those  that match one or more sets of key-value pairs that you spec-
          ify. For example, you can filter by the name of Subscription with an
          optional  operator to see subscriptions that match, partially match,
          or don't match a certain subscription's name.

          The valid names for this filter are:

          o Subscription

          The valid Operators for this filter are:

          o contains

          o equals

          o Notequal

          (structure)
              A filter object that is used to  return  more  specific  results
              from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of
              resources by specific criteria.

              Name -> (string)
                 The type of name to filter by.

              Operator -> (string)
                 An operator for filtering results.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more values for the name to filter by.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Operator=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Operator": "Equal"|"NotEqual"|"Contains",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The next token used for paginated responses. When this  field  isn't
          empty,  there  are  additional  elements that the service hasn't in-
          cluded in this request. Use this token with the next request to  re-
          trieve additional objects.

       Subscriptions -> (list)
          An array that contains subscription objects.

          (structure)
              An object which details a discovered Linux subscription.

              InstanceCount -> (long)
                 The  total  amount  of running instances using this subscrip-
                 tion.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the subscription.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of subscription. The type  can  be  subscription-in-
                 cluded  with  Amazon  EC2,  Bring Your Own Subscription model
                 (BYOS), or from the Amazon Web Services Marketplace.  Certain
                 subscriptions  may use licensing from the Amazon Web Services
                 Marketplace as well as OS licensing from Amazon EC2 or BYOS.
