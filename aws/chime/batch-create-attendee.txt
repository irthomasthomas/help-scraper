OPTIONS
       --meeting-id (string)
          The Amazon Chime SDK meeting ID.

          (structure)
              The  Amazon  Chime  SDK attendee fields to create, used with the
              BatchCreateAttendee action.

              ExternalUserId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Chime SDK external user ID. An idempotency  token.
                 Links the attendee to an identity managed by a builder appli-
                 cation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tag key-value pairs.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag applied to a resource.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ExternalUserId=string,Tags=[{Key=string,Value=string},{Key=string,Value=string}] ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ExternalUserId": "string",
              "Tags": [
                {
                  "Key": "string",
                  "Value": "string"
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

OUTPUT
       Attendees -> (list)
          The attendee information, including attendees IDs and join tokens.

          (structure)
              An  Amazon  Chime SDK meeting attendee. Includes a unique Atten-
              deeId and JoinToken . The JoinToken allows a client to authenti-
              cate  and  join as the specified attendee. The JoinToken expires
              when the meeting ends or when  DeleteAttendee is  called.  After
              that, the attendee is unable to join the meeting.

              We  recommend  securely  transferring  each  JoinToken from your
              server application to the client so that no other client has ac-
              cess to the token except for the one authorized to represent the
              attendee.

              ExternalUserId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Chime SDK external user ID. An idempotency  token.
                 Links the attendee to an identity managed by a builder appli-
                 cation.

              AttendeeId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Chime SDK attendee ID.

              JoinToken -> (string)
                 The join token used by the Amazon Chime SDK attendee.

       Errors -> (list)
          If the action fails for one or more of the attendees in the request,
          a  list of the attendees is returned, along with error codes and er-
          ror messages.

          (structure)
              The list of errors returned when errors are  encountered  during
              the  BatchCreateAttendee  and  CreateAttendee  actions. This in-
              cludes external user IDs, error codes, and error messages.

              ExternalUserId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Chime SDK external user ID. An idempotency  token.
                 Links the attendee to an identity managed by a builder appli-
                 cation.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The error code.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The error message.
