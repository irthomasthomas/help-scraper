LIST-CHANNEL-MESSAGES()                                LIST-CHANNEL-MESSAGES()



NAME
       list-channel-messages -

DESCRIPTION
       List  all  the messages in a channel. Returns a paginated list of Chan-
       nelMessages . By default, sorted by creation  timestamp  in  descending
       order.

       NOTE:
          Redacted  messages  appear  in  the results as empty, since they are
          only redacted, not deleted. Deleted messages do not  appear  in  the
          results.  This action always returns the latest version of an edited
          message.

          Also, the x-amz-chime-bearer request header is  mandatory.  Use  the
          AppInstanceUserArn  of the user that makes the API call as the value
          in the header.

OPTIONS
       --channel-arn (string)
          The ARN of the channel.

       --sort-order (string)
          The order in which you want messages sorted. Default is  Descending,
          based on time created.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --not-before (timestamp)
          The initial or starting time stamp for your requested messages.

       --not-after (timestamp)
          The final or ending time stamp for your requested messages.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of messages that you want returned.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token passed by previous API calls until all requested messages
          are returned.

       --chime-bearer (string)
          The AppInstanceUserArn of the user that makes the API call.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
