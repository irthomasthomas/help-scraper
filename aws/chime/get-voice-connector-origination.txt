OPTIONS
       --voice-connector-id (string)
          The Amazon Chime Voice Connector ID.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve origination settings

       The following  get-voice-connector-origination  example  retrieves  the
       origination  host,  port, protocol, priority, and weight for the speci-
       fied Amazon Chime Voice Connector.

          aws chime get-voice-connector-origination \
              --voice-connector-id abcdef1ghij2klmno3pqr4

       Output:

          {
              "Origination": {
                  "Routes": [
                      {
                          "Host": "10.24.34.0",
                          "Port": 1234,
                          "Protocol": "TCP",
                          "Priority": 1,
                          "Weight": 5
                      }
                  ],
                  "Disabled": false
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Origination -> (structure)
          The origination setting details.

          Routes -> (list)
              The  call  distribution  properties  defined for your SIP hosts.
              Valid range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 20.  This  pa-
              rameter  is not required, but you must specify this parameter or
              Disabled .

              (structure)
                 Origination routes define call  distribution  properties  for
                 your  SIP  hosts  to  receive inbound calls using your Amazon
                 Chime Voice Connector. Limit: Ten origination routes for each
                 Amazon Chime Voice Connector.

                 NOTE:
                     The  parameters  listed  below  are not required, but you
                     must use at least one.

                 Host -> (string)
                     The FQDN or IP address to contact for  origination  traf-
                     fic.

                 Port -> (integer)
                     The designated origination route port. Defaults to 5060.

                 Protocol -> (string)
                     The  protocol  to  use for the origination route. Encryp-
                     tion-enabled Amazon Chime Voice Connectors use TCP proto-
                     col by default.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     The  priority  associated with the host, with 1 being the
                     highest priority. Higher  priority  hosts  are  attempted
                     first.

                 Weight -> (integer)
                     The  weight  associated with the host. If hosts are equal
                     in priority, calls are redistributed among them based  on
                     their relative weight.

          Disabled -> (boolean)
              When  origination  settings  are disabled, inbound calls are not
              enabled for your Amazon Chime Voice Connector. This parameter is
              not required, but you must specify this parameter or Routes .
