NAME
       delete-account -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the specified Amazon Chime account. You must suspend all users
       before deleting Team account. You can use the  BatchSuspendUser  action
       to dodo.

       For  EnterpriseLWA  and  EnterpriseAD  accounts,  you  must release the
       claimed domains for your Amazon Chime account before deletion. As  soon
       as you release the domain, all users under that account are suspended.

       Deleted  accounts appear in your Disabled accounts list for 90 days. To
       restore deleted account from your Disabled accounts list, you must con-
       tact AWS Support.

       After  90 days, deleted accounts are permanently removed from your Dis-
       abled accounts list.

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Chime account ID.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
