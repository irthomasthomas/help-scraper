OPTIONS
       --meeting-id (string)
          The unique ID of the meeting being transcribed.

       --transcription-configuration (structure)
          The configuration for the current transcription operation. Must con-
          tain EngineTranscribeSettings or EngineTranscribeMedicalSettings .

          EngineTranscribeSettings -> (structure)
              The  transcription configuration settings passed to Amazon Tran-
              scribe.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 Specify the language code that represents the  language  spo-
                 ken.

                 If  you're  unsure of the language spoken in your audio, con-
                 sider using IdentifyLanguage  to  enable  automatic  language
                 identification.

              VocabularyFilterMethod -> (string)
                 Specify  how  you want your vocabulary filter applied to your
                 transcript.

                 To replace words with *** , choose mask .

                 To delete words, choose remove .

                 To flag words without changing them, choose tag .

              VocabularyFilterName -> (string)
                 Specify the name of the custom  vocabulary  filter  that  you
                 want to use when processing your transcription. Note that vo-
                 cabulary filter names are case sensitive.

                 If you use Amazon Transcribe in multiple Regions, the vocabu-
                 lary  filter  must  be available in Amazon Transcribe in each
                 Region.

                 If you include IdentifyLanguage and want to use one  or  more
                 vocabulary  filters  with your transcription, use the Vocabu-
                 laryFilterNames parameter instead.

              VocabularyName -> (string)
                 Specify the name of the custom vocabulary that  you  want  to
                 use  when processing your transcription. Note that vocabulary
                 names are case sensitive.

                 If you use Amazon Transcribe multiple Regions, the vocabulary
                 must be available in Amazon Transcribe in each Region.

                 If  you  include IdentifyLanguage and want to use one or more
                 custom vocabularies with your transcription, use the  Vocabu-
                 laryNames parameter instead.

              Region -> (string)
                 The AWS Region in which to use Amazon Transcribe.

                 If you don't specify a Region, then the MediaRegion parameter
                 of the CreateMeeting.html API will be used. However, if  Ama-
                 zon  Transcribe  is not available in the MediaRegion , then a
                 TranscriptFailed event is sent.

                 Use auto to use Amazon Transcribe in a Region near the  meet-
                 ings  MediaRegion . For more information, refer to Choosing a
                 transcription Region in the Amazon Chime SDK Developer  Guide
                 .

              EnablePartialResultsStabilization -> (boolean)
                 Enables  partial result stabilization for your transcription.
                 Partial result stabilization can reduce latency in your  out-
                 put, but may impact accuracy.

              PartialResultsStability -> (string)
                 Specify the level of stability to use when you enable partial
                 results stabilization (EnablePartialResultsStabilization ).

                 Low stability provides the highest accuracy.  High  stability
                 transcribes faster, but with slightly lower accuracy.

              ContentIdentificationType -> (string)
                 Labels  all personally identifiable information (PII) identi-
                 fied in your transcript. If you don't include  PiiEntityTypes
                 , all PII is identified.

                 You  cant set ContentIdentificationType and ContentRedaction-
                 Type .

              ContentRedactionType -> (string)
                 Content redaction is performed at the segment level.  If  you
                 don't include PiiEntityTypes , all PII is redacted.

                 You  cant set ContentIdentificationType and ContentRedaction-
                 Type .

              PiiEntityTypes -> (string)
                 Specify which types of  personally  identifiable  information
                 (PII)  you want to redact in your transcript. You can include
                 as many types as you'd like, or you can select ALL .

                 Values must be comma-separated and  can  include:  ADDRESS  ,
                 BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER   ,  BANK_ROUTING  ,  CREDIT_DEBIT_CVV  ,
                 CREDIT_DEBIT_EXPIRY  CREDIT_DEBIT_NUMBER , EMAIL ,``NAME``  ,
                 PHONE , PIN , SSN , or ALL .

                 Note  that  if you include PiiEntityTypes , you must also in-
                 clude ContentIdentificationType or ContentRedactionType .

                 If you include ContentRedactionType or ContentIdentification-
                 Type  ,  but  do  not  include  PiiEntityTypes  ,  all PII is
                 redacted or identified.

              LanguageModelName -> (string)
                 Specify the name of the custom language model that  you  want
                 to use when processing your transcription. Note that language
                 model names are case sensitive.

                 The language of the specified language model must  match  the
                 language  code. If the languages don't match, the custom lan-
                 guage model isn't applied. There are no  errors  or  warnings
                 associated with a language mismatch.

                 If  you use Amazon Transcribe in multiple Regions, the custom
                 language model must be available in Amazon Transcribe in each
                 Region.

              IdentifyLanguage -> (boolean)
                 Enables automatic language identification for your transcrip-
                 tion.

                 If you include IdentifyLanguage , you can optionally use Lan-
                 guageOptions  to  include  a  list of language codes that you
                 think may be present in your audio stream. Including language
                 options can improve transcription accuracy.

                 You  can  also  use  PreferredLanguage to include a preferred
                 language. Doing so can help Amazon  Transcribe  identify  the
                 language faster.

                 You must include either LanguageCode or IdentifyLanguage .

                 Language  identification  can't  be combined with custom lan-
                 guage models or redaction.

              LanguageOptions -> (string)
                 Specify two or more language codes that  represent  the  lan-
                 guages you think may be present in your media; including more
                 than five is not recommended. If you're unsure what languages
                 are present, do not include this parameter.

                 Including  language  options can improve the accuracy of lan-
                 guage identification.

                 If you include LanguageOptions , you must also include  Iden-
                 tifyLanguage .

                 WARNING:
                     You  can  only include one language dialect per language.
                     For example, you cannot include en-US and en-AU .

              PreferredLanguage -> (string)
                 Specify a preferred language from  the  subset  of  languages
                 codes you specified in LanguageOptions .

                 You  can  only use this parameter if you include IdentifyLan-
                 guage and LanguageOptions .

              VocabularyNames -> (string)
                 Specify the names of the custom vocabularies that you want to
                 use  when processing your transcription. Note that vocabulary
                 names are case sensitive.

                 If you use Amazon Transcribe in multiple Regions, the vocabu-
                 lary must be available in Amazon Transcribe in each Region.

                 If  you don't include IdentifyLanguage and want to use a cus-
                 tom vocabulary with your transcription, use  the  Vocabulary-
                 Name parameter instead.

              VocabularyFilterNames -> (string)
                 Specify  the  names of the custom vocabulary filters that you
                 want to use when processing your transcription. Note that vo-
                 cabulary filter names are case sensitive.

                 If you use Amazon Transcribe in multiple Regions, the vocabu-
                 lary filter must be available in Amazon  Transcribe  in  each
                 Region.

                 If  you're  not  including IdentifyLanguage and want to use a
                 custom vocabulary filter with your transcription, use the Vo-
                 cabularyFilterName parameter instead.
