OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the SIP rule.

       --trigger-type (string)
          The type of trigger assigned to the SIP rule in TriggerValue ,  cur-
          rently RequestUriHostname or ToPhoneNumber .

          Possible values:

          o ToPhoneNumber

          o RequestUriHostname

       --trigger-value (string)
          If TriggerType is RequestUriHostname , the value can be the outbound
          host name of an Amazon Chime  Voice  Connector.  If  TriggerType  is
          ToPhoneNumber  ,  the  value can be a customer-owned phone number in
          the E164 format. The SipMediaApplication specified in the SipRule is
          triggered  if the request URI in an incoming SIP request matches the
          RequestUriHostname , or if the To header in the incoming SIP request
          matches the ToPhoneNumber value.

       --disabled | --no-disabled (boolean)
          Enables  or  disables  a rule. You must disable rules before you can
          delete them.

       --target-applications (list)
          List of SIP media applications with priority and  AWS  Region.  Only
          one SIP application per AWS Region can be used.

          (structure)
              Target SIP media application and other details, such as priority
              and AWS Region, to be specified in the SIP rule.  Only  one  SIP
              rule per AWS Region can be provided.

              SipMediaApplicationId -> (string)
                 The SIP media application ID.

              Priority -> (integer)
                 Priority of the SIP media application in the target list.

              AwsRegion -> (string)
                 The AWS Region of the target application.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SipMediaApplicationId=string,Priority=integer,AwsRegion=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "SipMediaApplicationId": "string",
              "Priority": integer,
              "AwsRegion": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

              The SIP rule ID.

              tomer-owned phone number in E164 format.  SipRule  is  triggered
              when  a  SIP rule requests host name or ToPhoneNumber matches in
              the incoming SIP request.

          TargetApplications -> (list)
