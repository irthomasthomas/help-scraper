OPTIONS
       --sip-media-application-id (string)
          The SIP media application ID.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number of results to return in a single call. Defaults
          to 100.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,

          (structure)
              The  SIP  rule details, including name, triggers, and target ap-

              TriggerType -> (string)
                 The  type of trigger assigned to the SIP rule in TriggerValue

                 customer-owned  phone number in E164 format. SipRule is trig-
                 gered when a SIP rule requests  host  name  or  ToPhoneNumber
                 matches in the incoming SIP request.

              TargetApplications -> (list)
                 Target  SIP media application and other details, such as pri-
                 ority and AWS Region, to be specified in the SIP  rule.  Only
                 one SIP rule per AWS Region can be provided.

                     priority and AWS Region, to be specified in the SIP rule.
                     Only one SIP rule per AWS Region can be provided.

                     SipMediaApplicationId -> (string)
                        The SIP media application ID.

                        list.

                     AwsRegion -> (string)
                        The AWS Region of the target application.

              CreatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the SIP rule was created, in ISO 8601  for-
