       Shorthand Syntax:

          VoiceConnectorId=string,Priority=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "VoiceConnectorId": "string",
              "Priority": integer

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON

       the string will be taken literally.

       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
