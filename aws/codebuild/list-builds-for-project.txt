LIST-BUILDS-FOR-PROJECT()                            LIST-BUILDS-FOR-PROJECT()



NAME
       list-builds-for-project -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a list of build identifiers for the specified build project, with
       each build identifier representing a single build.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-builds-for-project is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: ids

SYNOPSIS
            list-builds-for-project
          --project-name <value>
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The name of the CodeBuild project.

       --sort-order (string)
          The  order  to  sort the results in. The results are sorted by build
          number, not the build identifier. If this is not specified, the  re-
          sults are sorted in descending order.

          Valid values include:

          o ASCENDING  :  List  the  build  identifiers in ascending order, by
            build number.

          o DESCENDING : List the build identifiers in  descending  order,  by
            build number.

          If the project has more than 100 builds, setting the sort order will
          result in an error.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view a list of builds for an AWS CodeBuild build project.

       The  following  list-builds-for-project  example lists the build IDs in
       descending order for the specified CodeBuild build project.

          aws codebuild list-builds-for-project --project-name codebuild-demo-project --sort-order DESCENDING

       Output:

          {
              "ids": [
                  "codebuild-demo-project:1a2b3c4d-5678-90ab-cdef-11111example",
                  "codebuild-demo-project:1a2b3c4d-5678-90ab-cdef-22222example",
                  "codebuild-demo-project:1a2b3c4d-5678-90ab-cdef-33333example",

                  "codebuild-demo-project:1a2b3c4d-5678-90ab-cdef-55555example"
              ]
          }

       (AWS CLI) in the AWS CodeBuild User Guide

OUTPUT
       ids -> (list)
          A  list  of  build identifiers for the specified build project, with
          each build ID representing a single build.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          If there are more than 100 items in the list,  only  the  first  100
          items  are returned, along with a unique string called a nextToken .
          To get the next batch of items in  the  list,  call  this  operation
          again, adding the next token to the call.
