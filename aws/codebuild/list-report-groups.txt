LIST-REPORT-GROUPS()                                      LIST-REPORT-GROUPS()



NAME
       list-report-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  list ARNs for the report groups in the current Amazon Web Ser-
       vices account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-report-groups is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: reportGroups

SYNOPSIS
            list-report-groups
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sort-order (string)
          Used  to  specify  the  order  to  sort  the list of returned report
          groups. Valid values are ASCENDING and DESCENDING .

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --sort-by (string)
          The criterion to be used to list build report groups.  Valid  values
          include:

          o CREATED_TIME : List based on when each report group was created.

          o LAST_MODIFIED_TIME : List based on when each report group was last
            changed.

          o NAME : List based on each report group's name.

          Possible values:

          o NAME

          o CREATED_TIME

          o LAST_MODIFIED_TIME

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get a list of the report group ARNs in AWS CodeBuild.

       The  following  list-report-groups  example  retrieves the report group
       ARNs for the account in the region.

          aws codebuild list-report-groups

       Output:

          {
              "reportGroups": [
                  "arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<user-ID>:report-group/report-group-1",
                  "arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<user-ID>:report-group/report-group-2",
                  "arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<user-ID>:report-group/report-group-3"
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Working with report groups in the  AWS  Code-
       Build User Guide.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          During  a previous call, the maximum number of items that can be re-
          turned is the value specified in maxResults . If there more items in
          the  list,  then  a unique string called a nextToken is returned. To
          get the next batch of items in the list, call this operation  again,
          adding  the  next  token to the call. To get all of the items in the
          list, keep calling this operation with each  subsequent  next  token
          that is returned, until no more next tokens are returned.

       reportGroups -> (list)
          The  list  of  ARNs  for the report groups in the current Amazon Web
          Services account.

          (string)
