          o TEST

          o CODE_COVERAGE

       --export-config (structure)

          s3Destination -> (structure)
              A  S3ReportExportConfig  object  that contains information about
              the S3 bucket where the run of a report is exported.

                 The  Amazon  Web  Services account identifier of the owner of
                 the Amazon S3 bucket. This allows report data to be  exported
                 to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by an account other than

                   This is the default if packaging is not specified.

                 o ZIP : CodeBuild creates a ZIP file with the raw data in the
                   output bucket.

              encryptionKey -> (string)
                 The encryption key for the report's encrypted raw data.

              encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                 A boolean value that specifies if the results of a report are
                 encrypted.

          that support CodeBuild report group tags.

          (structure)
              A tag, consisting of a key and a value.

              This  tag  is  available for use by Amazon Web Services services
              that support tags in CodeBuild.

              key -> (string)
                 The tag's key.

              value -> (string)
                 The tag's value.

              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a report group in AWS CodeBuild.

       The following create-report-group example creates a new report group.

          aws codebuild create-report-group \
              --cli-input-json file://create-report-group-source.json

       Contents of create-report-group-source.json:

          {
              "name": "cli-created-report-group",
              "type": "TEST",
              "exportConfig": {
