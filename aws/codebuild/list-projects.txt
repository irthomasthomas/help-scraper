LIST-PROJECTS()                                                LIST-PROJECTS()



NAME
       list-projects -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of build project names, with each build project name repre-
       senting a single build project.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-projects is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: projects

OPTIONS
       --sort-by (string)
          The  criterion  to be used to list build project names. Valid values
          include:

          o CREATED_TIME : List based on when each build project was created.

          o LAST_MODIFIED_TIME : List based on  when  information  about  each
            build project was last changed.

          o NAME : List based on each build project's name.

          Use  sortOrder  to  specify  in what order to list the build project
          names based on the preceding criteria.

          Possible values:

          o NAME

          o CREATED_TIME

          o LAST_MODIFIED_TIME

       --sort-order (string)
          The order in which to list build projects. Valid values include:

          o ASCENDING : List in ascending order.

          o DESCENDING : List in descending order.

          Use sortBy to specify the criterion to be used to list build project
          names.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get a list of AWS CodeBuild build project names.

       The following list-projects example gets  a  list  of  CodeBuild  build
       projects sorted by name in ascending order.

          aws codebuild list-projects --sort-by NAME --sort-order ASCENDING

       The  output  includes  a  nextToken value which indicates that there is
       more output available.

          {
              "nextToken": "Ci33ACF6...The full token has been omitted for brevity...U+AkMx8=",
              "projects": [
                  "codebuild-demo-project",
                  "codebuild-demo-project2",
                      ... The full list of build project names has been omitted for brevity ...
                  "codebuild-demo-project99"
              ]
          }

       Run this command again and provide the nextToken value from the  previ-
       ous  response as a parameter to get the next part of the output. Repeat
       until you don't receive a nextToken value in the response.

          aws codebuild list-projects  --sort-by NAME --sort-order ASCENDING --next-token Ci33ACF6...The full token has been omitted for brevity...U+AkMx8=

          {
              "projects": [
                  "codebuild-demo-project100",
                  "codebuild-demo-project101",
                      ... The full list of build project names has been omitted for brevity ...
                  "codebuild-demo-project122"
              ]
          }

       For more information, see View a List of Build Project Names (AWS  CLI)
       in the AWS CodeBuild User Guide.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          If  there  are  more  than 100 items in the list, only the first 100
          items are returned, along with a unique string called a nextToken  .
          To  get  the  next  batch  of items in the list, call this operation
          again, adding the next token to the call.

       projects -> (list)
          The list of build project names, with each build project name repre-
          senting a single build project.

          (string)
