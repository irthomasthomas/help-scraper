OPTIONS
       --report-arns (list)
          An array of ARNs that identify the Report objects to return.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about one or more reports in AWS CodeBuild.

       The following batch-get-reports example retrieves information about the
       reports with the specified ARNs.

              --report-arns arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<user-ID>:report/<report-group-name>:<report 1 ID> arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<user-ID>:report/<report-group-name>:<report 2 ID>

          (structure)
              Information about the results from  running  a  series  of  test
              cases  during  the  run  of  a build project. The test cases are
              specified in the buildspec for the build project  using  one  or
              more  paths  to the test case files. You can specify any type of
              tests you want, such as unit tests, integration tests, and func-
              tional tests.

              reportGroupArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the report group associated with this report.

              executionId -> (string)
                 The ARN of the build run that generated this report.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of this report.

                 The date and time this report run occurred.

              expired -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time a report expires. A report expires 30 days
                 after it is created. An expired report is  not  available  to
                 view in CodeBuild.

              exportConfig -> (structure)
                 Information  about  where  the raw data used to generate this
                 report was exported.

                 exportConfigType -> (string)
                     The export configuration type. Valid values are:

                     o S3 : The report results are exported to an S3 bucket.

                     o NO_EXPORT : The report results are not exported.

                 s3Destination -> (structure)
                     A S3ReportExportConfig object that  contains  information
                     about  the  S3  bucket  where  the run of a report is ex-
                     ported.

                     bucket -> (string)
                        The name of the S3 bucket where the raw data of a  re-

                        The  Amazon  Web  Services  account  identifier of the
                        owner of the Amazon S3 bucket. This allows report data
                        to be exported to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by
                        an account other than the account running the build.

                     path -> (string)

                     packaging -> (string)
                        The type of build output  artifact  to  create.  Valid
                        values include:

                        o NONE  : CodeBuild creates the raw data in the output
                          bucket. This is the  default  if  packaging  is  not
                          specified.

                        o ZIP : CodeBuild creates a ZIP file with the raw data
                          in the output bucket.

                     encryptionKey -> (string)

                        data.

                     encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                        A boolean value that specifies if the results of a re-
                        port are encrypted.

              truncated -> (boolean)
                 A boolean that specifies if this report run is truncated. The
                 list  of  test cases is truncated after the maximum number of
                 test cases is reached.

              testSummary -> (structure)
                 A TestReportSummary object that  contains  information  about
                 this test report.

                 total -> (integer)
                     The  number of test cases in this TestReportSummary . The
                     total includes truncated test cases.

                 statusCounts -> (map)
                     A map that contains the number of each type of status re-
                     turned by the test results in this TestReportSummary .

                     key -> (string)

                 durationInNanoSeconds -> (long)
                     The  number of nanoseconds it took to run all of the test
                     cases in this report.

              codeCoverageSummary -> (structure)
                 A CodeCoverageReportSummary object that contains a code  cov-
                 erage summary for this report.

                 lineCoveragePercentage -> (double)
