NAME
       update-project-visibility -

DESCRIPTION
       Changes  the  public  visibility for a project. The project's build re-
       sults, logs, and artifacts are available to  the  general  public.  For
       more information, see Public build projects in the CodeBuild User Guide
       .

       WARNING:
          The following should be kept in mind when making your projects  pub-
          lic:

          o All  of  a project's build results, logs, and artifacts, including
            builds that were run when the project was private,  are  available
            to the general public.

          o All build logs and artifacts are available to the public. Environ-
            ment variables, source code, and other sensitive  information  may
            have  been  output  to  the  build logs and artifacts. You must be
            careful about what information is output to the build  logs.  Some
            best practice are:

            o Do  not store sensitive values in environment variables. We rec-
              ommend that you use an  Amazon  EC2  Systems  Manager  Parameter
              Store or Secrets Manager to store sensitive values.

            o Follow  Best  practices for using webhooks in the CodeBuild User
              Guide to limit which entities can trigger a build,  and  do  not
              store  the  buildspec in the project itself, to ensure that your
              webhooks are as secure as possible.

          o A malicious user can use public builds to distribute malicious ar-
            tifacts.  We recommend that you review all pull requests to verify
            that the pull request is a legitimate change.  We  also  recommend
            that  you validate any artifacts with their checksums to make sure
            that the correct artifacts are being downloaded.

OPTIONS
       --project-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the build project.

       --project-visibility (string)
          Specifies the visibility of the project's  builds.  Possible  values
          are:
              PUBLIC_READ

          The project builds are visible to the public.
              PRIVATE

          The project builds are not visible to the public.

          Possible values:

          o PUBLIC_READ

          o PRIVATE

       --resource-access-role (string)
          The  ARN of the IAM role that enables CodeBuild to access the Cloud-
          Watch Logs and Amazon S3 artifacts for the project's builds.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

       projectArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the build project.

       publicProjectAlias -> (string)
          Contains the project identifier used with the public build APIs.

       projectVisibility -> (string)
