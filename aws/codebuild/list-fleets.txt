OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          During a previous call, if there are more  than  100  items  in  the
          list,  only  the  first  100 items are returned, along with a unique
          string called a nextToken . To get the next batch of  items  in  the
          list,  call this operation again, adding the next token to the call.
          To get all of the items in the list,  keep  calling  this  operation
          with each subsequent next token that is returned, until no more next
          tokens are returned.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of paginated  compute  fleets  returned  per  re-
          sponse.  Use nextToken to iterate pages in the list of returned com-
          pute fleets.

       --sort-order (string)
          The order in which to list compute fleets. Valid values include:

          o ASCENDING : List in ascending order.

          o DESCENDING : List in descending order.

          Use sortBy to specify the criterion to be used to list compute fleet
          names.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --sort-by (string)
          The  criterion  to be used to list compute fleet names. Valid values
          include:

          o CREATED_TIME : List based on when each compute fleet was created.

          o LAST_MODIFIED_TIME : List based on  when  information  about  each
            compute fleet was last changed.

          o NAME : List based on each compute fleet's name.

          Use  sortOrder  to  specify  in what order to list the compute fleet
          names based on the preceding criteria.

          Possible values:

          o NAME

          o CREATED_TIME

          o LAST_MODIFIED_TIME

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          If  there  are  more  than 100 items in the list, only the first 100
          items are returned, along with a unique string called a nextToken  .
          To  get  the  next  batch  of items in the list, call this operation
          again, adding the next token to the call.

       fleets -> (list)
          The list of compute fleet names.

          (string)
