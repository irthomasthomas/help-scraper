DESCRIBE-IMAGES()                                            DESCRIBE-IMAGES()



NAME
       describe-images -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns metadata that's related to the images in a repository in a pub-
       lic registry.

       NOTE:
          Beginning with Docker version 1.9, the Docker client compresses  im-
          age  layers  before pushing them to a V2 Docker registry. The output
          of the docker images command  shows  the  uncompressed  image  size.
          Therefore,  it might return a larger image size than the image sizes
          that are returned by  DescribeImages .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-images is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: imageDetails

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID that's associated with the public
          registry that contains the repository where images are described. If
          you  do  not  specify a registry, the default public registry is as-
          sumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The repository that contains the images to describe.

       --image-ids (list)
          The list of image IDs for the requested repository.

          (structure)
              An object with identifying information for an Amazon ECR image.

              imageDigest -> (string)
                 The sha256 digest of the image manifest.

              imageTag -> (string)
                 The tag that's used for the image.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          imageDigest=string,imageTag=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "imageDigest": "string",
              "imageTag": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       imageDetails -> (list)
          A list of  ImageDetail objects that contain data about the image.

          (structure)
              An  object  that  describes  an  image that's returned by a  De-
              scribeImages operation.

              registryId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID that's associated with the
                 public registry where this image belongs.

              repositoryName -> (string)
                 The name of the repository where this image belongs.

              imageDigest -> (string)

              imageTags -> (list)
                 The list of tags that's associated with this image.

                 (string)

              imageSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of the image in the repository.

                 If  the image is a manifest list, this is the max size of all
                 manifests in the list.

                 NOTE:
                     Beginning with Docker version 1.9, the Docker client com-
                     presses  image  layers before pushing them to a V2 Docker
                     registry. The output of the docker images  command  shows
                     the  uncompressed image size, so it might return a larger
                     image size than the image sizes that are returned by  De-
                     scribeImages .

              imagePushedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, expressed in standard JavaScript date for-
                 mat, that the current image was pushed to the repository at.

              imageManifestMediaType -> (string)
                 The media type of the image manifest.

              artifactMediaType -> (string)
                 The artifact media type of the image.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken value to include in a future  DescribeImages  request.
          When the results of a DescribeImages request exceed maxResults , you
          can use this value to retrieve the next page of  results.  If  there
          are no more results to return, this value is null .
