BATCH-DELETE-IMAGE()                                      BATCH-DELETE-IMAGE()



NAME
       batch-delete-image -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  list  of specified images that are within a repository in a
       public registry. Images are specified with either an  imageTag  or  im-
       ageDigest .

       You  can  remove  a  tag from an image by specifying the image's tag in
       your request. When you remove the last tag from an image, the image  is
       deleted from your repository.

       You  can completely delete an image (and all of its tags) by specifying
       the digest of the image in your request.

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID, or registry alias, that's  asso-
          ciated  with  the registry that contains the image to delete. If you
          do not specify a registry, the default public registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The repository in a public  registry  that  contains  the  image  to
          delete.

       --image-ids (list)
          A  list  of image ID references that correspond to images to delete.
          The format of the imageIds reference  is  imageTag=tag  or  imageDi-
          gest=digest .

          (structure)
              An object with identifying information for an Amazon ECR image.

              imageDigest -> (string)
                 The sha256 digest of the image manifest.

              imageTag -> (string)
                 The tag that's used for the image.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          imageDigest=string,imageTag=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "imageDigest": "string",
              "imageTag": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
