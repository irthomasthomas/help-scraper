DESCRIBE-REGISTRIES()                                    DESCRIBE-REGISTRIES()



NAME
       describe-registries -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns details for a public registry.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-registries is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: registries

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       o on

       o off

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       registries -> (list)
          An object that contains the details for a public registry.

          (structure)
              The details of a public registry.

              registryId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID that's associated with the
                 registry.  If you do not specify a registry, the default pub-
                 lic registry is assumed.

              registryArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the public registry.

              registryUri -> (string)
                 The URI of a public registry. The URI  contains  a  universal
                 prefix and the registry alias.

              verified -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  the account is a verified Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices Marketplace vendor. If an  account  is  verified,  each
                 public  repository  receives  a verified account badge on the
                 Amazon ECR Public Gallery.

              aliases -> (list)
                 An array of objects that represents the aliases for a  public
                 registry.

                 (structure)
                     An object representing the aliases for a public registry.
                     A public registry is given an alias  when  it's  created.
                     However,  a  custom alias can be set using the Amazon ECR
                     console. For more information, see Registries in the Ama-
                     zon Elastic Container Registry User Guide .

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the registry alias.

                     status -> (string)
                        The status of the registry alias.

                     primaryRegistryAlias -> (boolean)
                        Indicates  whether  the  registry alias is the primary
                        alias for the registry. If true, the alias is the pri-
                        mary  registry  alias  and  is  displayed  in both the
                        repository URL and the image URI used  in  the  docker
                        pull commands on the Amazon ECR Public Gallery.

                        NOTE:
                            A  registry  alias that isn't the primary registry
                            alias can be used  in  the  repository  URI  in  a
                            docker pull command.

                     defaultRegistryAlias -> (boolean)
                        Indicates  whether  the  registry alias is the default
                        alias for the registry. When the first public  reposi-
                        tory  is  created,  your public registry is assigned a
                        default registry alias.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken value to include in a future DescribeRepositories  re-
          quest.  If  the  results  of  a  DescribeRepositories request exceed
          maxResults , you can use this value to retrieve the next page of re-
          sults. If there are no more results, this value is null .
