OPTIONS
       --repository-name (string)
          The  name  to  use  for the repository. This appears publicly in the
          Amazon ECR Public Gallery. The repository name can be  specified  on
          its  own  (for example nginx-web-app ) or prepended with a namespace
          to group the repository into a category (for  example  project-a/ng-
          inx-web-app ).

       --catalog-data (structure)
          The  details  about  the repository that are publicly visible in the
          Amazon ECR Public Gallery.

          description -> (string)
              A short description of the contents of the repository. This text
              appears  in  both  the image details and also when searching for
              repositories on the Amazon ECR Public Gallery.

          architectures -> (list)
              The system architecture that the images in  the  repository  are
              compatible with. On the Amazon ECR Public Gallery, the following
              supported architectures appear as badges on the  repository  and
              are used as search filters.

              NOTE:
                 If  an  unsupported  tag  is added to your repository catalog
                 data, it's associated with the  repository  and  can  be  re-
                 trieved  using  the  API but isn't discoverable in the Amazon
                 ECR Public Gallery.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          description=string,architectures=string,string,operatingSystems=string,string,logoImageBlob=blob,aboutText=string,usageText=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "description": "string",
            "architectures": ["string", ...],
            "operatingSystems": ["string", ...],
            "logoImageBlob": blob,
            "aboutText": "string",
            "usageText": "string"
          }

       --tags (list)
          The  metadata  that  you apply to each repository to help categorize
          and organize your repositories. Each tag consists of a  key  and  an
          optional value. You define both of them. Tag keys can have a maximum
          character length of 128 characters, and tag values can have a  maxi-
          mum length of 256 characters.

          (structure)
              The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you categorize
              and organize them. Each tag consists of a key  and  an  optional
              value.  You  define  both. Tag keys can have a maximum character
              length of 128 characters, and tag  values  can  have  a  maximum
              length of 256 characters.

              Key -> (string)
                 One  part  of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  optional  part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
