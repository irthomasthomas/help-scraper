OPTIONS
       --repository-name (string)
          The  name  to  use  for the repository. This appears publicly in the
          Amazon ECR Public Gallery. The repository name may be  specified  on
          its own (such as nginx-web-app ) or it can be prepended with a name-
          space to group the repository into a category (such as project-a/ng-
          inx-web-app ).

       --catalog-data (structure)
          The  details  about  the repository that are publicly visible in the
          Amazon ECR Public Gallery.

          description -> (string)
              A short description of the contents of the repository. This text
              appears  in  both  the image details and also when searching for
              repositories on the Amazon ECR Public Gallery.

          architectures -> (list)
              The system architecture that the images in  the  repository  are
              compatible with. On the Amazon ECR Public Gallery, the following

              and are used as search filters.

              o Linux

              o Windows

              NOTE:
                 If  an  unsupported  tag  is added to your repository catalog
                 data, it will be associated with the repository  and  can  be
                 retrieved  using  the API but will not be discoverable in the
                 Amazon ECR Public Gallery.

              (string)

          operatingSystems -> (list)
              The operating systems that the images in the repository are com-

                 data, it will be associated with the repository  and  can  be
                 retrieved  using  the API but will not be discoverable in the
                 Amazon ECR Public Gallery.

              (string)

          logoImageBlob -> (blob)

              tional usage details for users of the repository. The text  must
              be in markdown format.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          description=string,architectures=string,string,operatingSystems=string,string,logoImageBlob=blob,aboutText=string,usageText=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "description": "string",
            "architectures": ["string", ...],
            "operatingSystems": ["string", ...],
            "logoImageBlob": blob,
            "aboutText": "string",
            "usageText": "string"
          }

       --tags (list)
          The metadata that you apply to the repository to help you categorize
          and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value,
          both  of  which  you  define.  Tag keys can have a maximum character
          length of 128 characters, and tag values can have a  maximum  length
          of 256 characters.

          (structure)
              The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you categorize
              and organize them. Each tag consists of a key  and  an  optional
              value,  both  of  which  you define. Tag keys can have a maximum
              character length of 128 characters, and tag values  can  have  a
              maximum length of 256 characters.

              Key -> (string)
                 One  part  of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  optional  part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
