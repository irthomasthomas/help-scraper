DESCRIBE-IMAGE-TAGS()                                    DESCRIBE-IMAGE-TAGS()



NAME
       describe-image-tags -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the image tag details for a repository in a public registry.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-image-tags is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: imageTagDetails

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID that's associated with the public
          registry that contains the repository where images are described. If
          you do not specify a registry, the default public  registry  is  as-
          sumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The  name  of  the repository that contains the image tag details to
          describe.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       imageTagDetails -> (list)
          The image tag details for the images in the requested repository.

          (structure)
              An object that represents the image tag details for an image.

              imageTag -> (string)
                 The tag that's associated with the image.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time stamp that indicates when the image tag was created.

              imageDetail -> (structure)
                 An object that describes the details of an image.

                 imageDigest -> (string)
                     The sha256 digest of the image manifest.

                 imageSizeInBytes -> (long)
                     The size, in bytes, of the image in the repository.

                     If  the image is a manifest list, this is the max size of
                     all manifests in the list.

                     NOTE:
                        Beginning with Docker version 1.9, the  Docker  client
                        compresses  image  layers  before pushing them to a V2
                        Docker registry. The output of the docker images  com-
                        mand  shows  the  uncompressed image size, so it might
                        return a larger image size than the image  sizes  that
                        are returned by  DescribeImages .

                 imagePushedAt -> (timestamp)
                     The  date and time, expressed in standard JavaScript date
                     format, which the current image tag  was  pushed  to  the
                     repository at.

                 imageManifestMediaType -> (string)
                     The media type of the image manifest.

                 artifactMediaType -> (string)
                     The artifact media type of the image.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value  to  include in a future DescribeImageTags re-
          quest. When the results of a DescribeImageTags request exceed maxRe-
          sults , you can use this value to retrieve the next page of results.
          If there are no more results to return, this value is null .
