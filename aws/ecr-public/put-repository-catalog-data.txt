          {
            "description": "string",

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON

       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not

       the string will be taken literally.

       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
