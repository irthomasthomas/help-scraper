OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID that's associated with the public
          registry that contains the repository to delete. If you do not spec-
          ify a registry, the default public registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository to delete.

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          The force option can be used to delete a  repository  that  contains
          images.  If  the  force  option  is not used, the repository must be
          empty prior to deletion.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
