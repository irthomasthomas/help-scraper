GET-LOGIN-PASSWORD()                                      GET-LOGIN-PASSWORD()



NAME
       get-login-password -

DESCRIPTION
       To log in to an Amazon ECR public registry

       Retrieves  and displays an authentication token using the GetAuthoriza-
       tionToken API that you can use to authenticate to an Amazon ECR  public
       registry.  You can pass the authorization token to the login command of
       the container client of your preference, such as the Docker CLI.  After
       you  have authenticated to an Amazon ECR public registry with this com-
       mand, you can use the client to push and pull images from that registry
       as  long  as your IAM principal has access to do so until the token ex-
       pires. The authorization token is valid for 12 hours. This command  re-
       quires  the 'ecr-public:GetAuthorizationToken' and 'sts:GetServiceBear-
       erToken' permissions.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To authenticate docker to an Amazon ECR public registry

       The following get-login-password example retrieves and displays an  au-
       thentication token using the GetAuthorizationToken API that you can use
       to authenticate to an Amazon ECR public registry.

          aws ecr-public get-login-password \
              --region us-east-1
          | docker login \
              --username AWS \
              --password-stdin public.ecr.aws

       This command produces no output in the terminal but instead  pipes  the
       output to Docker.

       For  more  information,  see Authenticate to the public registry in the
       Amazon ECR Public.

       Example 2: To authenticate docker to your own custom  AmazonECR  public
       registry

       The  following get-login-password example retrieves and displays an au-
       thentication token using the GetAuthorizationToken API that you can use
       to authenticate to your own custom Amazon ECR public registry.

           aws ecr-public get-login-password \
              --region us-east-1 \
          | docker login \
              --username AWS \
              --password-stdin public.ecr.aws/<your-public-registry-custom-alias>

       This  command produces no output in the terminal but insteads pipes the
       output to Docker.
