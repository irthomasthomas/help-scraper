COMPLETE-LAYER-UPLOAD()                                COMPLETE-LAYER-UPLOAD()



NAME
       complete-layer-upload -

DESCRIPTION
       Informs Amazon ECR that the image layer upload is complete for a speci-
       fied public registry, repository name, and upload ID. You  can  option-
       ally  provide  a  sha256  digest of the image layer for data validation
       purposes.

       When an image is pushed, the CompleteLayerUpload API is called once for
       each new image layer to verify that the upload is complete.

       NOTE:
          This  operation is used by the Amazon ECR proxy and is not generally
          used by customers for pulling and pushing images. In most cases, you
          should use the docker CLI to pull, tag, and push images.

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The  Amazon  Web  Services account ID, or registry alias, associated
          with the registry where layers are uploaded. If you do not specify a
          registry, the default public registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The  name  of  the repository in a public registry to associate with
          the image layer.

       --upload-id (string)
          The upload ID from a previous  InitiateLayerUpload operation to  as-
          sociate with the image layer.

       --layer-digests (list)
          The sha256 digest of the image layer.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       registryId -> (string)
          The public registry ID that's associated with the request.

       repositoryName -> (string)
          The repository name that's associated with the request.

       uploadId -> (string)
          The upload ID that's associated with the layer.

       layerDigest -> (string)
          The sha256 digest of the image layer.
