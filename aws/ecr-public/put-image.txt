PUT-IMAGE()                                                        PUT-IMAGE()



NAME
       put-image -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates or updates the image manifest and tags that are associated with
       an image.

       When an image is pushed and all new image layers  have  been  uploaded,
       the  PutImage API is called once to create or update the image manifest
       and the tags that are associated with the image.

       NOTE:
          This operation is used by the Amazon ECR proxy and is not  generally
          used by customers for pulling and pushing images. In most cases, you
          should use the docker CLI to pull, tag, and push images.

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID, or registry alias, that's  asso-
          ciated  with  the public registry that contains the repository where
          the image is put. If you do not specify a registry, the default pub-
          lic registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository where the image is put.

       --image-manifest (string)
          The image manifest that corresponds to the image to be uploaded.

       --image-manifest-media-type (string)
          The  media type of the image manifest. If you push an image manifest
          that doesn't contain the mediaType field, you must specify  the  im-
          ageManifestMediaType in the request.

       --image-tag (string)
          The  tag to associate with the image. This parameter is required for
          images that use the Docker Image Manifest V2 Schema 2 or  Open  Con-
          tainer Initiative (OCI) formats.

       --image-digest (string)
          The  image  digest of the image manifest that corresponds to the im-
          age.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
