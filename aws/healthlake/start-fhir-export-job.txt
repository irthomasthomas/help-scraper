OPTIONS
       --job-name (string)
          The user generated name for an export job.

       --output-data-config (tagged union structure)
          The  output data configuration that was supplied when the export job
          was created.

          NOTE:
              This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following  top
              level keys can be set: S3Configuration.

          S3Configuration -> (structure)
              The  output data configuration that was supplied when the export
              job was created.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The S3Uri is the user specified S3 location of the FHIR  data
                 to be imported into AWS HealthLake.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The KMS key ID used to access the S3 bucket.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Configuration={S3Uri=string,KmsKeyId=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Configuration": {
              "S3Uri": "string",
              "KmsKeyId": "string"
            }
          }

       --datastore-id (string)
          The  AWS  generated ID for the data store from which files are being
          exported for an export job.

       --data-access-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name used during the initiation of the job.

       --client-token (string)
          An optional user provided token used for ensuring idempotency.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To start a FHIR export job

       The following start-fhir-export-job example shows how to start  a  FHIR
       export job using Amazon HealthLake.

          aws healthlake start-fhir-export-job \
              --output-data-config S3Uri="s3://(Bucket Name)/(Prefix Name)/" \
              --datastore-id (Datastore ID) \
              --data-access-role-arn arn:aws:iam::(AWS Account ID):role/(Role Name)

       Output:

          {
              "DatastoreId": "(Datastore ID)",
              "JobStatus": "SUBMITTED",
              "JobId": "9b9a51943afaedd0a8c0c26c49135a31"
          }

       For more information, see Exporting files from a FHIR Data Store in the
       Amazon HealthLake Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          The AWS generated ID for an export job.

       JobStatus -> (string)
          The status of a FHIR export job. Possible  statuses  are  SUBMITTED,
          IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, or FAILED.

       DatastoreId -> (string)
          The  AWS  generated ID for the data store from which files are being
          exported for an export job.
