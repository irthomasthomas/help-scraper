NAME
       ungroup-resources -

DESCRIPTION

       tion works only  with  static  groups  that  you  populated  using  the
       GroupResources operation. It doesn't work with any resource groups that
       are automatically populated by tag-based or CloudFormation  stack-based
       queries.
          Minimum permissions

       To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

OPTIONS
       --group (string)
          The  name  or the ARN of the resource group from which to remove the
          resources.

       --resource-arns (list)
          The ARNs of the resources to be removed from the group.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Succeeded -> (list)
          A list of resources that were successfully removed from the group by
          this operation.

          (string)

       Failed -> (list)
          A  list of any resources that failed to be removed from the group by
          this operation.

          (structure)
              A resource that failed to be added to or removed from a group.

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the resource that failed to be added or removed.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The error message text associated with the failure.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The error code associated with the failure.

       Pending -> (list)
          A list of any resources that are still in the process of  being  re-
          moved  from the group by this operation. These pending removals con-
          tinue asynchronously. You can check the status of  pending  removals
          by using the ``  ListGroupResources `` operation. After the resource
          is successfully removed, it no longer appears in the response.

          (structure)
              A structure that identifies a resource that is currently pending
              addition  to  the  group as a member. Adding a resource to a re-
              source group happens asynchronously as  a  background  task  and
              this one isn't completed yet.

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  resource  name (ARN) of the resource that's in a
                 pending state.
