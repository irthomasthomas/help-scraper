OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)
          Don't use this parameter. Use Group instead.

       --group (string)
          The name or the ARN of the resource group to query.

       --resource-query (structure)
          The resource query to determine which Amazon Web Services  resources
          are members of this resource group.

          NOTE:
              A  resource  group  can  contain either a Configuration or a Re-
              sourceQuery , but not both.

          Type -> (string)
              The type of the query to perform. This can have one of two  val-
              ues:

              o

                *
                CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0:  * Specifies that you want the group
                to contain the members of an CloudFormation stack.  The  Query
                contains a StackIdentifier element with an ARN for a CloudFor-
                mation stack.

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 111)
                Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

              o

                *
                TAG_FILTERS_1_0: * Specifies that you want the  group  to  in-
                clude resource that have tags that match the query.

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 113)
                Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

          Query -> (string)
              The query that defines a group or a search. The contents depends
              on the value of the Type element.

              o ResourceTypeFilters  Applies to all ResourceQuery  objects  of
                either  Type  . This element contains one of the following two
                items:

                o The value AWS::AllSupported . This causes the  ResourceQuery
                  to  match resources of any resource type that also match the
                  query.

                o A list (a JSON array)  of  resource  type  identifiers  that
                  limit  the  query  to only resources of the specified types.
                  For the complete list of resource types that you can use  in
                  the  array value for ResourceTypeFilters , see Resources you
                  can use with Resource Groups and Tag Editor in the  Resource
                  Groups User Guide .

              Example:  "ResourceTypeFilters":  ["AWS::AllSupported"]  or "Re-
              sourceTypeFilters": ["AWS::EC2::Instance", "AWS::S3::Bucket"]

              o TagFilters  applicable only if Type =  TAG_FILTERS_1_0  .  The
                Query  contains  a JSON string that represents a collection of
                simple tag filters. The JSON string uses a syntax  similar  to
                the  ``  GetResources  ``  operation,  but  uses  only  the ``
                ResourceTypeFilters `` and `` TagFilters  ``  fields.  If  you
                specify  more  than one tag key, only resources that match all
                tag keys, and at least one value of each  specified  tag  key,
                are returned in your query. If you specify more than one value
                for a tag key, a resource matches the filter if it has  a  tag
                key  value that matches any of the specified values. For exam-
                ple, consider the following sample query  for  resources  that
                have  two  tags,  Stage  and  Version  , with two values each:
                [{"Stage":["Test","Deploy"]},{"Version":["1","2"]}]   The  re-
                sults of this resource query could include the following.

                o An  Amazon  EC2  instance  that  has the following two tags:
                  {"Stage":"Deploy"} , and {"Version":"2"}

                o An  S3   bucket   that   has   the   following   two   tags:
                  {"Stage":"Test"} , and {"Version":"1"}

              The resource query results would not include the following items
              in the results, however.

                 o An Amazon EC2 instance that has  only  the  following  tag:
                   {"Stage":"Deploy"}  . The instance does not have all of the
                   tag keys specified in the filter, so it  is  excluded  from
                   the results.

                 o An   RDS   database   that  has  the  following  two  tags:
                   {"Stage":"Archived"} and {"Version":"4"}   The database has
                   all  of the tag keys, but none of those keys has an associ-
                   ated value that matches at least one of the specified  val-
                   ues in the filter.

              Example:  "TagFilters": [ { "Key": "Stage", "Values": [ "Gamma",
              "Beta" ] }

              o StackIdentifier   applicable  only  if  Type   =   CLOUDFORMA-
                TION_STACK_1_0 . The value of this parameter is the Amazon Re-
                source Name (ARN) of the CloudFormation stack whose  resources
                you want included in the group.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Query=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Type": "TAG_FILTERS_1_0"|"CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0",
            "Query": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To update the query for a tag-based resource group

       The following update-group-query example updates the query attached  to
       the specified tag-based resource group.

          aws resource-groups update-group-query \
              --group-name tbq-WebServer \
              --resource-query '{"Type":"TAG_FILTERS_1_0", "Query":"{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::EC2::Instance\"],\"TagFilters\":[{\"Key\":\"Name\", \"Values\":[\"WebServers\"]}]}"}'

       Output:

          {
              "Group": {
                  "GroupArn": "arn:aws:resource-groups:us-east-2:123456789012:group/tbq-WebServer",
                  "Name": "tbq-WebServer"
              },
              "ResourceQuery": {
                  "Type": "TAG_FILTERS_1_0",
                  "Query": "{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::EC2::Instance\"],\"TagFilters\":[{\"Key\":\"Name\", \"Values\":[\"WebServers\"]}]}"
              }
          }

       Guide.

       Example 2: To update the query for  a  CloudFormation  stack-based  re-
       source group

       The  following update-group-query example updates the query attached to
       the specified AWS CloudFormation stack-based resource group.

          aws resource-groups update-group-query \
              --group-name cbq-CFNstackgroup \
              --resource-query '{"Type": "CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0", "Query": "{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::AllSupported\"],\"StackIdentifier\":\"arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/MyCFNStack/1415z9z0-z39z-11z8-97z5-500z212zz6fz\"}"}'

       Output:

          {
              "Group": {
                  "GroupArn": "arn:aws:resource-groups:us-west-2:123456789012:group/cbq-CFNstackgroup",

OUTPUT
       GroupQuery -> (structure)
          The  updated resource query associated with the resource group after
          the update.

          GroupName -> (string)
              The name of the resource group that is associated with the spec-
              ified resource query.

          ResourceQuery -> (structure)
              The resource query that determines which Amazon Web Services re-
              sources are members of the associated resource group.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of the query to perform. This can have  one  of  two
                 values:

                 o

                   *
                   CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0:  *  Specifies  that  you want the
                   group to contain the members of  an  CloudFormation  stack.
                   The  Query  contains  a StackIdentifier element with an ARN
                   for a CloudFormation stack.

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 386)
                   Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

                 o

                   *
                   TAG_FILTERS_1_0: * Specifies that you want the group to in-
                   clude resource that have tags that match the query.

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 388)
                   Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

              Query -> (string)
                 The  query that defines a group or a search. The contents de-
                 pends on the value of the Type element.

                 o ResourceTypeFilters  Applies to all  ResourceQuery  objects
                   of either Type . This element contains one of the following
                   two items:

                   o The value AWS::AllSupported . This causes  the  Resource-
                     Query  to  match resources of any resource type that also
                     match the query.

                   o A list (a JSON array) of resource type  identifiers  that
                     limit the query to only resources of the specified types.
                     For the complete list of resource types that you can  use
                     in   the   array  value  for  ResourceTypeFilters  ,  see
                     Resources you can use with Resource Groups and Tag Editor
                     in the Resource Groups User Guide .

                 Example: "ResourceTypeFilters": ["AWS::AllSupported"] or "Re-
                 sourceTypeFilters": ["AWS::EC2::Instance", "AWS::S3::Bucket"]

                 o TagFilters  applicable only if Type = TAG_FILTERS_1_0 . The
                   Query  contains  a JSON string that represents a collection
                   of simple tag filters. The JSON string uses a syntax  simi-
                   lar  to the `` GetResources `` operation, but uses only the
                   `` ResourceTypeFilters `` and `` TagFilters ``  fields.  If
                   you  specify  more  than  one  tag key, only resources that
                   match all tag keys, and at least one value of  each  speci-
                   fied  tag  key,  are returned in your query. If you specify
                   more than one value for a tag key, a resource  matches  the
                   filter  if  it  has a tag key value that matches any of the
                   specified values. For example, consider the following  sam-
                   ple  query for resources that have two tags, Stage and Ver-
                   sion  ,  with  two  values  each:    [{"Stage":["Test","De-
                   ploy"]},{"Version":["1","2"]}]    The  results  of this re-
                   source query could include the following.

                   o An Amazon EC2 instance that has the following  two  tags:
                     {"Stage":"Deploy"} , and {"Version":"2"}

                   o An   S3   bucket   that   has  the  following  two  tags:
                     {"Stage":"Test"} , and {"Version":"1"}

                 The resource query results would not  include  the  following
                 items in the results, however.

                     o An Amazon EC2 instance that has only the following tag:
                       {"Stage":"Deploy"} . The instance does not have all  of
                       the tag keys specified in the filter, so it is excluded
                       from the results.

                     o An RDS  database  that  has  the  following  two  tags:
                       {"Stage":"Archived"} and {"Version":"4"}   The database
                       has all of the tag keys, but none of those keys has  an
                       associated value that matches at least one of the spec-
                       ified values in the filter.

                 Example:  "TagFilters":  [  {  "Key":  "Stage",  "Values":  [
                 "Gamma", "Beta" ] }

                 o StackIdentifier   applicable  only  if  Type  = CLOUDFORMA-
                   TION_STACK_1_0 . The value of this parameter is the  Amazon
                   Resource  Name  (ARN) of the CloudFormation stack whose re-
                   sources you want included in the group.
