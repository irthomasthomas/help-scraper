LIST-GROUPS()                                                    LIST-GROUPS()



NAME
       list-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of existing resource groups in your account.
          Minimum permissions

       To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

       o resource-groups:ListGroups

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-groups  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: GroupIdentifiers, Groups

SYNOPSIS
            list-groups
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Filters, formatted as  GroupFilter objects, that you want  to  apply
          to a ListGroups operation.

          o resource-type  -  Filter  the results to include only those of the
            specified resource types. Specify up to five resource types in the
            format  AWS::*ServiceCode*  ::*ResourceType*  ``  .  For  example,
            ``AWS::EC2::Instance , or AWS::S3::Bucket .

          o configuration-type - Filter the  results  to  include  only  those
            groups  that  have the specified configuration types attached. The
            current supported values are:

            o AWS:EC2::CapacityReservationPool

            o AWS:EC2::HostManagement

          (structure)
              A filter collection that you can use  to  restrict  the  results
              from a List operation to only those you want to include.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One  or  more  filter  values.  Allowed filter values vary by
                 group filter name, and are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "resource-type"|"configuration-type",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the available resource groups

       The  following  list-groups  example  displays a list of all of the re-
       source groups.

          aws resource-groups list-groups

       Output:

          {
              "GroupIdentifiers": [
                  {
                      "GroupName": "tbq-WebServer",
                      "GroupArn": "arn:aws:resource-groups:us-west-2:123456789012:group/tbq-WebServer3"
                  },
                  {
                      "GroupName": "cbq-CFNStackQuery",
                      "GroupArn": "arn:aws:resource-groups:us-west-2:123456789012:group/cbq-CFNStackQuery"
                  }
              ],
              "Groups": [
                  {
                      "GroupArn": "arn:aws:resource-groups:us-west-2:123456789012:group/tbq-WebServer",
                      "Name": "tbq-WebServer"
                  },
                  {
                      "GroupArn": "arn:aws:resource-groups:us-west-2:123456789012:group/cbq-CFNStackQuery",
                      "Name": "cbq-CFNStackQuery"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       GroupIdentifiers -> (list)
          A list of  GroupIdentifier objects. Each  identifier  is  an  object
          that contains both the Name and the GroupArn .

          (structure)
              The unique identifiers for a resource group.

              GroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the resource group.

              GroupArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the resource group.

       Groups -> (list)

          WARNING:

              o Deprecated  -  don't  use  this  field. Use the ``GroupIdenti-
                fiers`` response field instead. *

          (structure)
              A resource group that contains AWS resources. You can assign re-
              sources to the group by associating either of the following ele-
              ments with the group:

              o ResourceQuery - Use a resource query to specify a set  of  tag
                keys  and values. All resources in the same AWS Region and AWS
                account that have those keys with the same values are included
                in the group. You can add a resource query when you create the
                group, or later by using the  PutGroupConfiguration operation.

              o GroupConfiguration - Use a service configuration to  associate
                the  group  with  an  AWS service. The configuration specifies
                which resource types can be included in the group.

              GroupArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the resource group.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the resource group.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the resource group.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If present, indicates that more output is available than is included
          in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken request pa-
          rameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the  next  part
          of  the  output. You should repeat this until the NextToken response
          element comes back as null .
