OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the group, which is the identifier of the group in other
          operations.  You can't change the name of a resource group after you
          create it. A resource group name can consist  of  letters,  numbers,
          hyphens,  periods, and underscores. The name cannot start with AWS ,
          aws , or any other possible capitalization; these  are  reserved.  A
          resource  group  name must be unique within each Amazon Web Services
          Region in your Amazon Web Services account.

       --description (string)
          The description of the resource group. Descriptions can  consist  of
          letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores, periods, and spaces.

       --resource-query (structure)
          The  resource  query  that  determines which Amazon Web Services re-
          sources are members of this group. For more  information  about  re-
          source queries, see Create a tag-based group in Resource Groups .

          NOTE:
              A resource group can contain either a ResourceQuery or a Config-
              uration , but not both.

          Type -> (string)
              The type of the query to perform. This can have one of two  val-
              ues:

              o

                *
                CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0:  * Specifies that you want the group
                to contain the members of an CloudFormation stack.  The  Query
                contains  a  StackIdentifier  element  with an Amazon resource
                name (ARN) for a CloudFormation stack.

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 116)
                Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

              o

                *
                TAG_FILTERS_1_0: * Specifies that you want the  group  to  in-
                clude resource that have tags that match the query.

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 118)
                Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

          Query -> (string)
              The query that defines a group or a search. The contents depends
              on the value of the Type element.

              o ResourceTypeFilters  Applies to all ResourceQuery  objects  of
                either  Type  . This element contains one of the following two
                items:

                o The value AWS::AllSupported . This causes the  ResourceQuery
                  to  match resources of any resource type that also match the
                  query.

                o A list (a JSON array)  of  resource  type  identifiers  that
                  limit  the  query  to only resources of the specified types.
                  For the complete list of resource types that you can use  in
                  the  array value for ResourceTypeFilters , see Resources you
                  can use with Resource Groups and Tag Editor in the  Resource
                  Groups User Guide .

              Example:  "ResourceTypeFilters":  ["AWS::AllSupported"]  or "Re-
              sourceTypeFilters": ["AWS::EC2::Instance", "AWS::S3::Bucket"]

              o TagFilters  applicable only if Type =  TAG_FILTERS_1_0  .  The
                Query  contains  a JSON string that represents a collection of
                simple tag filters. The JSON string uses a syntax  similar  to
                the  ``  GetResources  ``  operation,  but  uses  only  the ``
                ResourceTypeFilters `` and `` TagFilters  ``  fields.  If  you
                specify  more  than one tag key, only resources that match all
                tag keys, and at least one value of each  specified  tag  key,
                are returned in your query. If you specify more than one value
                for a tag key, a resource matches the filter if it has  a  tag
                key  value that matches any of the specified values. For exam-
                ple, consider the following sample query  for  resources  that
                have  two  tags,  Stage  and  Version  , with two values each:
                [{"Stage":["Test","Deploy"]},{"Version":["1","2"]}]   The  re-
                sults of this resource query could include the following.

                o An  Amazon  EC2  instance  that  has the following two tags:
                  {"Stage":"Deploy"} , and {"Version":"2"}

                o An  S3   bucket   that   has   the   following   two   tags:
                  {"Stage":"Test"} , and {"Version":"1"}

              The resource query results would not include the following items
              in the results, however.

                 o An Amazon EC2 instance that has  only  the  following  tag:
                   {"Stage":"Deploy"}  . The instance does not have all of the
                   tag keys specified in the filter, so it  is  excluded  from
                   the results.

                 o An   RDS   database   that  has  the  following  two  tags:
                   {"Stage":"Archived"} and {"Version":"4"}   The database has
                   all  of the tag keys, but none of those keys has an associ-
                   ated value that matches at least one of the specified  val-
                   ues in the filter.

              Example:  "TagFilters": [ { "Key": "Stage", "Values": [ "Gamma",
              "Beta" ] }

              o StackIdentifier   applicable  only  if  Type   =   CLOUDFORMA-
                TION_STACK_1_0 . The value of this parameter is the Amazon Re-
                source Name (ARN) of the CloudFormation stack whose  resources
                you want included in the group.

       --configuration (list)
          A  configuration  associates  the  resource group with an Amazon Web
          Services service and specifies how the service can interact with the
          resources in the group. A configuration is an array of  GroupConfig-
          urationItem elements. For details about the syntax of  service  con-
          figurations, see Service configurations for Resource Groups .

          NOTE:
              A  resource  group  can  contain either a Configuration or a Re-
              sourceQuery , but not both.

          (structure)
              An item in a group configuration. A group service  configuration
              can have one or more items. For details about group service con-
              figuration  syntax,  see  Service  configurations  for  resource
              groups .

              Type -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  type  of  group configuration item. Each item
                 must have a unique value for type . For  the  list  of  types
                 that  you can specify for a configuration item, see Supported
                 resource types and parameters .

                 uration item type, see Supported resource types  and  parame-
                 ters .

                 (structure)
                     A  parameter  for a group configuration item. For details
                     about group service  configuration  syntax,  see  Service
                     configurations for resource groups .

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the group configuration parameter. For the
                        list of parameters that you can use with each configu-
                        ration item type, see Supported resource types and pa-

       --criticality (integer)
          The  critical  rank  of the application group on a scale of 1 to 10,
          with a rank of 1 being the most critical, and a  rank  of  10  being
          least critical.

       --owner (string)

          who is considered as the owner of this application group within your
          organization.

       --display-name (string)
          The name of the application group, which you can change at any time.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create a tag-based resource group

       The following create-group example creates a tag-based  resource  group
       of  Amazon  EC2  instances in the current region. It's based on a query
       for resources that are tagged with the key Name,  and  the  value  Web-
       Servers.  The  group  name is tbq-WebServer. The query is in a separate
       JSON file that is passed to the command.

          aws resource-groups create-group \
              --name tbq-WebServer \
              --resource-query file://query.json

       Contents of query.json:

          {
              "Type": "TAG_FILTERS_1_0",
              "Query": "{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::EC2::Instance\"],\"TagFilters\":[{\"Key\":\"Name\", \"Values\":[\"WebServers\"]}]}"
          }

       Output:

          {
              "Group": {
                  "GroupArn": "arn:aws:resource-groups:us-west-2:123456789012:group/tbq-WebServer",
                  "Name": "tbq-WebServer"
              },
              "ResourceQuery": {
                  "Type": "TAG_FILTERS_1_0",
                  "Query": "{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::EC2::Instance\"],\"TagFilters\":[{\"Key\":\"Name\", \"Values\":[\"WebServers\"]}]}"
              }
          }

       Example 2: To create a CloudFormation stack-based resource group

       The  following  create-group  example  creates  an  AWS  CloudFormation
       stack-based  resource  group  named  sampleCFNstackgroup. The query in-
       cludes all resources in the specified  CloudFormation  stack  that  are
       supported by AWS Resource Groups.

          aws resource-groups create-group \
              --name cbq-CFNstackgroup \
              --resource-query file://query.json

       Contents of query.json:

          {
              "Type": "CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0",
              "Query": "{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::AllSupported\"],\"StackIdentifier\":\"arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/MyCFNStack/1415z9z0-z39z-11z8-97z5-500z212zz6fz\"}"
          }

       Output:

          {
              "Group": {
                  "GroupArn": "arn:aws:resource-groups:us-west-2:123456789012:group/cbq-CFNstackgroup",
                  "Name": "cbq-CFNstackgroup"
              },
              "ResourceQuery": {
                  "Type": "CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0",
                  "Query": "{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::AllSupported\"],\"StackIdentifier\":\"arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-2:123456789012:stack/MyCFNStack/1415z9z0-z39z-11z8-97z5-500z212zz6fz\"}"}'
              }
          }

          Query -> (string)
              The query that defines a group or a search. The contents depends
              on the value of the Type element.

              o ResourceTypeFilters  Applies to all ResourceQuery  objects  of
                either  Type  . This element contains one of the following two
                items:

                o The value AWS::AllSupported . This causes the  ResourceQuery
                  to  match resources of any resource type that also match the
                  query.

                o A list (a JSON array)  of  resource  type  identifiers  that
                  limit  the  query  to only resources of the specified types.
                  For the complete list of resource types that you can use  in
                  the  array value for ResourceTypeFilters , see Resources you
                  can use with Resource Groups and Tag Editor in the  Resource
                  Groups User Guide .

              Example:  "ResourceTypeFilters":  ["AWS::AllSupported"]  or "Re-
              sourceTypeFilters": ["AWS::EC2::Instance", "AWS::S3::Bucket"]

              o TagFilters  applicable only if Type =  TAG_FILTERS_1_0  .  The
                Query  contains  a JSON string that represents a collection of
                simple tag filters. The JSON string uses a syntax  similar  to
                the  ``  GetResources  ``  operation,  but  uses  only  the ``
                ResourceTypeFilters `` and `` TagFilters  ``  fields.  If  you
                specify  more  than one tag key, only resources that match all
                tag keys, and at least one value of each  specified  tag  key,
                are returned in your query. If you specify more than one value
                for a tag key, a resource matches the filter if it has  a  tag
                key  value that matches any of the specified values. For exam-
                ple, consider the following sample query  for  resources  that
                have  two  tags,  Stage  and  Version  , with two values each:
                [{"Stage":["Test","Deploy"]},{"Version":["1","2"]}]   The  re-
                sults of this resource query could include the following.

                o An  Amazon  EC2  instance  that  has the following two tags:
                  {"Stage":"Deploy"} , and {"Version":"2"}

                o An  S3   bucket   that   has   the   following   two   tags:
                  {"Stage":"Test"} , and {"Version":"1"}

              The resource query results would not include the following items
              in the results, however.

                 o An Amazon EC2 instance that has  only  the  following  tag:
                   {"Stage":"Deploy"}  . The instance does not have all of the
                   tag keys specified in the filter, so it  is  excluded  from
                   the results.

                 o An   RDS   database   that  has  the  following  two  tags:
                   {"Stage":"Archived"} and {"Version":"4"}   The database has
                   all  of the tag keys, but none of those keys has an associ-
                   ated value that matches at least one of the specified  val-
                   ues in the filter.

              Example:  "TagFilters": [ { "Key": "Stage", "Values": [ "Gamma",
              "Beta" ] }

              o StackIdentifier   applicable  only  if  Type   =   CLOUDFORMA-
                TION_STACK_1_0 . The value of this parameter is the Amazon Re-
                source Name (ARN) of the CloudFormation stack whose  resources
                you want included in the group.
