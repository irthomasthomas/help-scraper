LIST-GROUP-RESOURCES()                                  LIST-GROUP-RESOURCES()



NAME
       list-group-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of ARNs of the resources that are members of a specified
       resource group.
          Minimum permissions

       To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

       o resource-groups:ListGroupResources

       o cloudformation:DescribeStacks

       o cloudformation:ListStackResources

       o tag:GetResources

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-group-resources is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: ResourceIdentifiers, Resources

OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)

          WARNING:

              o Deprecated  -  don't use this parameter. Use the ``Group`` re-
                quest field instead. *

       --group (string)
          The name or the ARN of the resource group

       --filters (list)
          Filters, formatted as  ResourceFilter objects, that you want to  ap-
          ply  to  a  ListGroupResources operation. Filters the results to in-
          clude only those of the specified resource types.

          o resource-type - Filter resources by their type. Specify up to five
            resource  types in the format AWS::ServiceCode::ResourceType . For
            example, AWS::EC2::Instance , or AWS::S3::Bucket .

          When you specify a resource-type filter for ListGroupResources , AWS
          Resource  Groups  validates  your  filter resource types against the
          types that are defined in the query associated with the  group.  For
          example, if a group contains only S3 buckets because its query spec-
          ifies only that resource type, but  your  resource-type  filter  in-
          cludes  EC2  instances,  AWS Resource Groups does not filter for EC2
          instances. In this case,  a  ListGroupResources  request  returns  a
          BadRequestException error with a message similar to the following:
              The  resource  types specified as filters in the request are not
              valid.

          The error includes a list of resource types that failed the  valida-
          tion  because  they  are  not  part of the query associated with the
          group. This validation doesn't occur when the group query  specifies
          AWS::AllSupported  ,  because a group based on such a query can con-
          tain any of the allowed resource types for the query type (tag-based
          or AWS CloudFormation stack-based queries).

          (structure)
              A  filter  name  and value pair that is used to obtain more spe-
              cific results from a list of resources.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Allowed filter values vary by  re-
                 source filter name, and are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "resource-type",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list all of the resources in a resource group

       Example 1: The following list-resource-groups example lists all of  the
       resources that are part of the specified resource group.

          aws resource-groups list-group-resources \
              --group-name tbq-WebServer

       Output:

          {
              "ResourceIdentifiers": [
                  {
                      "ResourceArn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-09f77fa38c12345ab",
                      "ResourceType": "AWS::EC2::Instance"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Example  2:  The  following  example  lists all of the resources in the
       group that also have a 'resource-type' of the 'AWS::EC2::Instance'. :

          aws resource-groups list-group-resources
                 --group-name tbq-WebServer --filters  Name=resource-type,Val-
                 ues=AWS::EC2::Instance

OUTPUT
       Resources -> (list)
          An  array  of resources from which you can determine each resource's
          identity, type, and group membership status.

          (structure)
              A structure returned by the  ListGroupResources  operation  that
              contains  identity  and  group membership status information for
              one of the resources in the group.

              Identifier -> (structure)
                 A structure that contains the ARN of a resource and  its  re-
                 source type.

                 ResourceArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of a resource.

                 ResourceType -> (string)
                     The  resource  type  of a resource, such as AWS::EC2::In-
                     stance .

              Status -> (structure)
                 A structure that contains the status of this resource's  mem-
                 bership in the group.

                 NOTE:
                     This  field  is present in the response only if the group
                     is of type AWS::EC2::HostManagement .

                 Name -> (string)
                     The current status.

       ResourceIdentifiers -> (list)

          WARNING:
              ** Deprecated - don't use this parameter. Use the  ``Resources``
              response field instead. **

          (structure)
              A structure that contains the ARN of a resource and its resource
              type.

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of a resource.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The resource type of a resource, such as AWS::EC2::Instance .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If present, indicates that more output is available than is included
          in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken request pa-
          rameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the  next  part
          of  the  output. You should repeat this until the NextToken response
          element comes back as null .

       QueryErrors -> (list)
          A list of QueryError objects. Each error is an object that  contains
          ErrorCode  and Message structures. Possible values for ErrorCode are
          CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_INACTIVE and  CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_NOT_EXISTING
          .

          (structure)
              A  two-part error structure that can occur in ListGroupResources
              or  SearchResources  operations  on  CloudFormation  stack-based
              queries.  The  error occurs if the CloudFormation stack on which
              the query is based either does not exist, or has a  status  that
              renders  the  stack  inactive.  A QueryError occurrence does not
              necessarily mean that AWS Resource Groups could not complete the
              operation,  but  the  resulting  group  might have no member re-
              sources.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 Possible values are CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_INACTIVE and  CLOUD-
                 FORMATION_STACK_NOT_EXISTING .

              Message -> (string)
                 A  message  that explains the ErrorCode value. Messages might
                 state that the specified CloudFormation stack does not  exist
                 (or  no  longer  exists). For CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_INACTIVE ,
                 the message typically states that  the  CloudFormation  stack
                 has  a status that is not (or no longer) active, such as CRE-
                 ATE_FAILED .
