OPTIONS
       --chat-configuration-arn (string) The ARN of the MicrosoftTeamsChannel-
       Configuration associated with the user identities to list.

       --next-token (string) An optional token returned from a prior  request.
       Use  this token for pagination of results from this action. If this pa-
       rameter is specified, the response includes only results beyond the to-
       ken, up to the value specified by MaxResults.

       --max-results (integer) The maximum number of results to include in the
       response. If more results exist than the specified MaxResults value,  a
       token  is included in the response so that the remaining results can be
       retrieved.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

                 get the team ID, you must perform the  initial  authorization
                 flow  with  Microsoft  Teams in the AWS Chatbot console. Then
                 you can copy and paste the team ID from the console. For more

          value specified by MaxResults.
