DESCRIPTION
       Database  Migration Service (DMS) can migrate your data to and from the
       most widely used commercial and open-source databases such  as  Oracle,
       PostgreSQL,  Microsoft SQL Server, Amazon Redshift, MariaDB, Amazon Au-
       rora, MySQL, and SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE). The service sup-
       ports  homogeneous migrations such as Oracle to Oracle, as well as het-
       erogeneous migrations between different database platforms, such as Or-
       acle to MySQL or SQL Server to PostgreSQL.

       For more information about DMS, see What Is Database Migration Service?
       in the Database Migration Service User Guide.
