       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a notification rule

       The  following  update-notification-rule example updates a notification
       rule named MyNotificationRule in the AWS account 123456789012  using  a
       JSON file named update.json.

          aws codestar-notifications update-notification-rule \
              --cli-input-json file://update.json

       Contents of update.json:

          {
              "Name": "MyUpdatedNotificationRule",
              "EventTypeIds": [
                  "codecommit-repository-branches-and-tags-created"
              ],
              "Resource": "arn:aws:codecommit:us-east-1:123456789012:MyDemoRepo",
              "Targets": [
                  {
                      "TargetType": "SNS",
                      "TargetAddress": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MyNotificationTopic"
                  }
              ],
              "Status": "ENABLED",
              "DetailType": "FULL"
          }

       Output:

          {
              "Arn": "arn:aws:codestar-notifications:us-east-1:123456789012:notificationrule/dc82df7a-EXAMPLE"
