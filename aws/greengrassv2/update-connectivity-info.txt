UPDATE-CONNECTIVITY-INFO()                          UPDATE-CONNECTIVITY-INFO()



NAME
       update-connectivity-info -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates connectivity information for a Greengrass core device.

       Connectivity  information includes endpoints and ports where client de-
       vices can connect to an MQTT broker on the core device. When  a  client
       device  calls the IoT Greengrass discovery API , IoT Greengrass returns
       connectivity information for all of the core devices where  the  client
       device can connect. For more information, see Connect client devices to
       core devices in the IoT Greengrass Version 2 Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-connectivity-info
          --thing-name <value>
          --connectivity-info <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the core device. This is also the name of the IoT thing.

       --connectivity-info (list)
          The connectivity information for the core device.

          (structure)
              Contains information about an endpoint and port where client de-
              vices can connect to an MQTT broker on a Greengrass core device.

              id -> (string)
                 An ID for the connectivity information.

              hostAddress -> (string)
                 The  IP  address or DNS address where client devices can con-
                 nect to an MQTT broker on the Greengrass core device.

              portNumber -> (integer)
                 The port where the MQTT broker operates on the  core  device.
                 This  port  is  typically 8883, which is the default port for
                 the MQTT broker component that runs on core devices.

              metadata -> (string)
                 Additional metadata to provide to client devices that connect
                 to this core device.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          id=string,hostAddress=string,portNumber=integer,metadata=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "id": "string",
              "hostAddress": "string",
              "portNumber": integer,
              "metadata": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update connectivity information for a Greengrass core device

       The  following  update-connectivity-info  example gets the connectivity
       information for a Greengrass core device. Client devices use  this  in-
       formation to connect to the MQTT broker that runs on this core device.

          aws greengrassv2 update-connectivity-info \
              --thing-name MyGreengrassCore \
              --cli-input-json file://core-device-connectivity-info.json

       Contents of core-device-connectivity-info.json:

          {
              "connectivityInfo": [
                  {
                      "hostAddress": "192.0.2.0",
                      "portNumber": 8883,
                      "id": "localIP_192.0.2.0"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Output:

          {
              "version": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
          }

       For  more  information, see Manage core device endpoints in the AWS IoT
       Greengrass V2 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       version -> (string)
          The new version of the connectivity information for the core device.

       message -> (string)
          A message about the connectivity information update request.
