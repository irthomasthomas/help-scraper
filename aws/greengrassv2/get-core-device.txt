GET-CORE-DEVICE()                                            GET-CORE-DEVICE()



NAME
       get-core-device -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves metadata for a Greengrass core device.

       NOTE:
          IoT  Greengrass  relies on individual devices to send status updates
          to the Amazon Web Services Cloud. If the IoT Greengrass  Core  soft-
          ware  isn't  running  on the device, or if device isn't connected to
          the Amazon Web Services Cloud, then the reported status of that  de-
          vice  might not reflect its current status. The status timestamp in-
          dicates when the device status was last updated.

          Core devices send status updates at the following times:

          o When the IoT Greengrass Core software starts

          o When the core device receives a deployment  from  the  Amazon  Web
            Services Cloud

          o When the status of any component on the core device becomes BROKEN

          o At  a  regular interval that you can configure , which defaults to
            24 hours

          o For IoT Greengrass Core v2.7.0, the core device sends  status  up-
            dates upon local deployment and cloud deployment

OPTIONS
       --core-device-thing-name (string)
          The name of the core device. This is also the name of the IoT thing.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get a core device

       The following get-core-device example gets information about an AWS IoT
       Greengrass core device.

          aws greengrassv2 get-core-device \
              --core-device-thing-name MyGreengrassCore

       Output:

          {
