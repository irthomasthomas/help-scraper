GET-CONNECTIVITY-INFO()                                GET-CONNECTIVITY-INFO()



NAME
       get-connectivity-info -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves connectivity information for a Greengrass core device.

       Connectivity  information includes endpoints and ports where client de-
       vices can connect to an MQTT broker on the core device. When  a  client
       device  calls the IoT Greengrass discovery API , IoT Greengrass returns
       connectivity information for all of the core devices where  the  client
       device can connect. For more information, see Connect client devices to
       core devices in the IoT Greengrass Version 2 Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-connectivity-info
          --thing-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the core device. This is also the name of the IoT thing.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get the connectivity information for a Greengrass core device

       The following get-connectivity-info example gets the  connectivity  in-
       formation  for a Greengrass core device. Client devices use this infor-
       mation to connect to the MQTT broker that runs on this core device.

          aws greengrassv2 get-connectivity-info \
              --thing-name MyGreengrassCore

       Output:

          {
              "connectivityInfo": [
                  {
                      "id": "localIP_192.0.2.0",
                      "hostAddress": "192.0.2.0",
                      "portNumber": 8883
                  }
              ]
          }

       Greengrass V2 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       connectivityInfo -> (list)
          The connectivity information for the core device.

          (structure)
              Contains information about an endpoint and port where client de-
              vices can connect to an MQTT broker on a Greengrass core device.

              id -> (string)
                 An ID for the connectivity information.

              hostAddress -> (string)
                 The IP address or DNS address where client devices  can  con-
                 nect to an MQTT broker on the Greengrass core device.

              portNumber -> (integer)
                 The  port  where the MQTT broker operates on the core device.
                 This port is typically 8883, which is the  default  port  for
                 the MQTT broker component that runs on core devices.

              metadata -> (string)
                 Additional metadata to provide to client devices that connect
                 to this core device.

       message -> (string)
          A message about the connectivity information request.
