GET-CONNECTIVITY-INFO()                                GET-CONNECTIVITY-INFO()



NAME
       get-connectivity-info -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves connectivity information for a Greengrass core device.

       Connectivity  information includes endpoints and ports where client de-
       vices can connect to an MQTT broker on the core device. When  a  client
       device  calls the IoT Greengrass discovery API , IoT Greengrass returns
       connectivity information for all of the core devices where  the  client
       device can connect. For more information, see Connect client devices to
       core devices in the IoT Greengrass Version 2 Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the core device. This is also the name of the IoT thing.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get the connectivity information for a Greengrass core device

       The  following  get-connectivity-info example gets the connectivity in-
       formation for a Greengrass core device. Client devices use this  infor-
       mation to connect to the MQTT broker that runs on this core device.

          aws greengrassv2 get-connectivity-info \
              --thing-name MyGreengrassCore

       Output:

          {
              "connectivityInfo": [
                  {
                      "id": "localIP_192.0.2.0",
                      "hostAddress": "192.0.2.0",
                      "portNumber": 8883
                  }
              ]
          }

       Greengrass V2 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       connectivityInfo -> (list)
          The connectivity information for the core device.

          (structure)
              Contains information about an endpoint and port where client de-
              vices can connect to an MQTT broker on a Greengrass core device.

              id -> (string)
                 An ID for the connectivity information.

              hostAddress -> (string)
                 The  IP  address or DNS address where client devices can con-
                 nect to an MQTT broker on the Greengrass core device.

              portNumber -> (integer)
                 The port where the MQTT broker operates on the  core  device.
                 This  port  is  typically 8883, which is the default port for
                 the MQTT broker component that runs on core devices.

              metadata -> (string)
                 Additional metadata to provide to client devices that connect
                 to this core device.

       message -> (string)
          A message about the connectivity information request.
