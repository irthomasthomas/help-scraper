LIST-INSTALLED-COMPONENTS()                        LIST-INSTALLED-COMPONENTS()



NAME
       list-installed-components -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a paginated list of the components that a Greengrass core de-
       vice runs. By default, this list doesn't include  components  that  are
       deployed  as  dependencies of other components. To include dependencies
       in the response, set the topologyFilter parameter to ALL .

       NOTE:
          IoT Greengrass relies on individual devices to send  status  updates
          to  the  Amazon Web Services Cloud. If the IoT Greengrass Core soft-
          ware isn't running on the device, or if device  isn't  connected  to
          the  Amazon Web Services Cloud, then the reported status of that de-
          vice might not reflect its current status. The status timestamp  in-
          dicates when the device status was last updated.

          Core devices send status updates at the following times:

          o When the IoT Greengrass Core software starts

          o When  the  core  device  receives a deployment from the Amazon Web
            Services Cloud

          o When the status of any component on the core device becomes BROKEN

          o At a regular interval that you can configure , which  defaults  to
            24 hours

          o For  IoT  Greengrass Core v2.7.0, the core device sends status up-
            dates upon local deployment and cloud deployment

       list-installed-components is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: installedComponents

OPTIONS
       --core-device-thing-name (string)
          The name of the core device. This is also the name of the IoT thing.

       --topology-filter (string)
          The filter for the list of components. Choose from the following op-
          tions:

          o ALL  The list includes all components installed on  the  core  de-
            vice.

          o ROOT  The list includes only root components, which are components
            that you specify in a deployment. When you choose this option, the
            list  doesn't  include components that the core device installs as
            dependencies of other components.

          Default: ROOT

          Possible values:

          o ALL

          o ROOT

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list components installed on a core device

       The  following  list-installed-components  example lists the components
       that are installed on an AWS IoT Greengrass core device.

          aws greengrassv2 list-installed-components \
              --core-device-thing-name MyGreengrassCore

       Output:

OUTPUT
       installedComponents -> (list)
          A list that summarizes each component on the core device.

          NOTE:
              Accuracy  of  the  lastStatusChangeTimestamp response depends on
              Greengrass nucleus v2.7.0. It performs best  on  Greengrass  nu-
              cleus v2.7.0 and can be inaccurate on earlier versions.

          (structure)
              Contains  information about a component on a Greengrass core de-
              vice.

              componentName -> (string)
                 The name of the component.

              componentVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the component.

              lifecycleState -> (string)
                 The lifecycle state of the component.

              lifecycleStateDetails -> (string)
                 The details about the lifecycle state of the component.

              isRoot -> (boolean)
                 Whether or not the component is a root component.

              lastStatusChangeTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The status of how current the data is.

                 This response is based off of component  state  changes.  The
                 status  reflects  component disruptions and deployments. If a
                 component only sees a configuration update during  a  deploy-
                 ment,  it  might  not  undergo a state change and this status
                 would not be updated.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results, or null if there are no addi-
          tional results.
