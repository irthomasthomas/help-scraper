LIST-INSTALLED-COMPONENTS()                        LIST-INSTALLED-COMPONENTS()



NAME
       list-installed-components -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a paginated list of the components that a Greengrass core de-
       vice runs. This list doesn't include components that are deployed  from
       local  deployments  or  components that are deployed as dependencies of
       other components.

       NOTE:
          IoT Greengrass relies on individual devices to send  status  updates
          to  the  Amazon Web Services Cloud. If the IoT Greengrass Core soft-
          ware isn't running on the device, or if device  isn't  connected  to
          the  Amazon Web Services Cloud, then the reported status of that de-
          vice might not reflect its current status. The status timestamp  in-
          dicates when the device status was last updated.

          Core devices send status updates at the following times:

          o When the IoT Greengrass Core software starts

          o When  the  core  device  receives a deployment from the Amazon Web
            Services Cloud

          o When the status of any component on the core device becomes BROKEN

          o At a regular interval that you can configure , which  defaults  to
            24 hours

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-installed-components  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: installedComponents

SYNOPSIS
            list-installed-components
          --core-device-thing-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --core-device-thing-name (string)
          The name of the core device. This is also the name of the IoT thing.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list components installed on a core device

       The following list-installed-components example  lists  the  components
       that are installed on an AWS IoT Greengrass core device.

          aws greengrassv2 list-installed-components \
              --core-device-thing-name MyGreengrassCore

       Output:

          {
              "installedComponents": [
                  {
                      "componentName": "aws.greengrass.Cli",
                      "componentVersion": "2.0.3",
                      "lifecycleState": "RUNNING",
                      "isRoot": true
                  },
                  {
                      "componentName": "aws.greengrass.Nucleus",
                      "componentVersion": "2.0.3",
                      "lifecycleState": "FINISHED",
                      "isRoot": true
                  }
              ]
          }
