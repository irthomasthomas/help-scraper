LIST-CORE-DEVICES()                                        LIST-CORE-DEVICES()



NAME
       list-core-devices -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a paginated list of Greengrass core devices.

       NOTE:
          IoT  Greengrass  relies on individual devices to send status updates
          to the Amazon Web Services Cloud. If the IoT Greengrass  Core  soft-
          ware  isn't  running  on the device, or if device isn't connected to
          the Amazon Web Services Cloud, then the reported status of that  de-
          vice  might not reflect its current status. The status timestamp in-
          dicates when the device status was last updated.

          Core devices send status updates at the following times:

          o When the IoT Greengrass Core software starts

          o When the core device receives a deployment  from  the  Amazon  Web
            Services Cloud

          o When the status of any component on the core device becomes BROKEN

          o At  a  regular interval that you can configure , which defaults to
            24 hours

          o For IoT Greengrass Core v2.7.0, the core device sends  status  up-
            dates upon local deployment and cloud deployment

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-core-devices  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: coreDevices

OPTIONS
       --thing-group-arn (string)
          The ARN of the IoT thing group by which to filter.  If  you  specify
          this  parameter,  the list includes only core devices that have suc-
          cessfully deployed a deployment that targets the thing  group.  When
          you  remove  a core device from a thing group, the list continues to
          include that core device.

       --status (string)
          The core device status by which to filter. If you specify  this  pa-
          rameter,  the list includes only core devices that have this status.
          Choose one of the following options:

          o HEALTHY  The IoT Greengrass Core software and all  components  run
            on the core device without issue.

          o UNHEALTHY  The IoT Greengrass Core software or a component is in a
            failed state on the core device.

          Possible values:

          o HEALTHY

          o UNHEALTHY

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list core devices

       The following list-core-devices example lists the  AWS  IoT  Greengrass
       core devices in your AWS account in the current Region.

                   nents run on the core device without issue.

                 o UNHEALTHY  The IoT Greengrass Core software or a  component
                   is in a failed state on the core device.

              lastStatusUpdateTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  time at which the core device's status last updated, ex-
                 pressed in ISO 8601 format.
