NAME
       appfabric -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Web  Services  AppFabric quickly connects software as a service
       (SaaS) applications across your organization. This allows IT and  secu-
       rity  teams  to  easily manage and secure applications using a standard
       schema, and employees can complete everyday tasks faster using  genera-
       tive  artificial  intelligence (AI). You can use these APIs to complete
       AppFabric tasks, such as setting up audit  log  ingestions  or  viewing
       user  access.  For  more information about AppFabric, including the re-
       quired permissions to use the service, see the Amazon Web Services App-
       Fabric Administration Guide . For more information about using the Com-
       mand Line Interface (CLI) to manage your AppFabric resources,  see  the
       AppFabric section of the CLI Reference .
