LIST-LEDGERS()                                                  LIST-LEDGERS()



NAME
       list-ledgers -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  an array of ledger summaries that are associated with the cur-
       rent Amazon Web Services account and Region.

       This action returns a maximum of 100 items and is paginated so that you
       can retrieve all the items by calling ListLedgers multiple times.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-ledgers
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of results to return in a single ListLedgers re-
          quest. (The actual number of results returned might be fewer.)

       --next-token (string)
          A pagination token, indicating that you want to  retrieve  the  next
          page  of  results.  If you received a value for NextToken in the re-
          sponse from a previous ListLedgers call, then you  should  use  that
          value as input here.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list your available ledgers

       The  following  list-ledgers example lists all ledgers that are associ-
       ated with the current AWS account and Region.

          aws qldb list-ledgers

       Output:

          {
              "Ledgers": [
                  {
                      "State": "ACTIVE",
                      "CreationDateTime": 1568839243.951,
                      "Name": "myExampleLedger"
                  },
                  {
                      "State": "ACTIVE",
                      "CreationDateTime": 1568839543.557,
                      "Name": "myExampleLedger2"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Ledgers -> (list)
          The  array  of ledger summaries that are associated with the current
          Amazon Web Services account and Region.

          (structure)
              Information about a ledger, including its name, state, and  when
              it was created.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the ledger.

              State -> (string)
                 The current status of the ledger.

              CreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time, in epoch time format, when the ledger was
                 created. (Epoch time format is the number of seconds  elapsed
                 since 12:00:00 AM January 1, 1970 UTC.)

       NextToken -> (string)
          A pagination token, indicating whether there are more results avail-
          able:

          o If NextToken is empty, then the last page of results has been pro-
            cessed and there are no more results to be retrieved.

          o If  NextToken is not empty, then there are more results available.
            To retrieve the next page of results, use the value  of  NextToken
            in a subsequent ListLedgers call.
