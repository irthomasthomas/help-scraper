LIST-LEDGERS()                                                  LIST-LEDGERS()



NAME
       list-ledgers -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  all  ledgers  that  are associated with the current Amazon Web
       Services account and Region.

       This action returns a maximum of MaxResults items and is  paginated  so
       that  you  can  retrieve  all the items by calling ListLedgers multiple
       times.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

SYNOPSIS

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in a single ListLedgers  re-
          quest. (The actual number of results returned might be fewer.)

       --next-token (string)
          A  pagination  token,  indicating that you want to retrieve the next
          page of results. If you received a value for NextToken  in  the  re-
          sponse  from  a  previous ListLedgers call, then you should use that
          value as input here.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list your available ledgers

       The following list-ledgers example lists all ledgers that  are  associ-
       ated with the current AWS account and Region.

          aws qldb list-ledgers

       Output:

          {
              "Ledgers": [
                  {
                      "State": "ACTIVE",
                      "CreationDateTime": 1568839243.951,
                      "Name": "myExampleLedger"
                  },
                  {
                      "State": "ACTIVE",
                      "CreationDateTime": 1568839543.557,
                      "Name": "myExampleLedger2"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Ledgers -> (list)
          The ledgers that are associated with the current Amazon Web Services
          account and Region.

          (structure)
              Information  about a ledger, including its name, state, and when
              it was created.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the ledger.

              State -> (string)
                 The current status of the ledger.

              CreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in epoch time format, when the ledger  was
                 created.  (Epoch time format is the number of seconds elapsed
                 since 12:00:00 AM January 1, 1970 UTC.)

       NextToken -> (string)
          A pagination token, indicating whether there are more results avail-
          able:

          o If NextToken is empty, then the last page of results has been pro-
            cessed and there are no more results to be retrieved.

          o If NextToken is not empty, then there are more results  available.
            To  retrieve  the next page of results, use the value of NextToken
            in a subsequent ListLedgers call.
