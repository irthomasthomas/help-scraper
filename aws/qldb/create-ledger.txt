OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the ledger that you want to create.  The  name  must  be
          unique  among all of the ledgers in your Amazon Web Services account
          in the current Region.

          Naming constraints for ledger names are defined in Quotas in  Amazon
          QLDB in the Amazon QLDB Developer Guide .

       --tags (map)
          The  key-value  pairs  to add as tags to the ledger that you want to
          create. Tag keys are case sensitive. Tag values are  case  sensitive
          and can be null.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --permissions-mode (string)
          The  permissions  mode to assign to the ledger that you want to cre-
          ate. This parameter can have one of the following values:

          o ALLOW_ALL : A legacy permissions mode that enables access  control
            with API-level granularity for ledgers. This mode allows users who
            have the SendCommand API permission for this  ledger  to  run  all
            PartiQL  commands  (hence, ALLOW_ALL ) on any tables in the speci-
            fied ledger. This mode disregards any table-level or command-level
            IAM permissions policies that you create for the ledger.

          o STANDARD  :  (Recommended ) A permissions mode that enables access
            control with finer granularity for ledgers,  tables,  and  PartiQL
            commands.  By  default,  this mode denies all user requests to run
            any PartiQL commands on any tables in this ledger. To  allow  Par-
            tiQL commands to run, you must create IAM permissions policies for
            specific table resources and PartiQL actions, in addition  to  the
            SendCommand  API  permission  for the ledger. For information, see
            Getting started with the standard permissions mode in  the  Amazon
            QLDB Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              We  strongly  recommend  using  the STANDARD permissions mode to
              maximize the security of your ledger data.

          Possible values:

          o ALLOW_ALL

          o STANDARD

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          The flag that prevents a ledger from being deleted by any  user.  If
          not  provided on ledger creation, this feature is enabled (true ) by
          default.

          If deletion protection is enabled, you must first disable it  before
          you  can  delete  the  ledger. You can disable it by calling the Up-
          dateLedger operation to set the flag to false .

       --kms-key (string)
          The key in Key Management Service (KMS) to  use  for  encryption  of
          data  at rest in the ledger. For more information, see Encryption at
          rest in the Amazon QLDB Developer Guide .

          Use one of the following options to specify this parameter:

          o AWS_OWNED_KMS_KEY : Use an KMS key that is owned  and  managed  by
            Amazon Web Services on your behalf.

          o Undefined : By default, use an Amazon Web Services owned KMS key.

          o A valid symmetric customer managed KMS key : Use the specified KMS
            key in your account that you create, own, and manage. Amazon  QLDB
            does  not support asymmetric keys. For more information, see Using
            symmetric and asymmetric keys in the Key Management Service Devel-
            oper Guide .

          To  specify a customer managed KMS key, you can use its key ID, Ama-
          zon Resource Name (ARN), alias name, or alias  ARN.  When  using  an
          alias  name, prefix it with "alias/" . To specify a key in a differ-
          ent Amazon Web Services account, you must use the key ARN  or  alias
          ARN.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias

          o Alias ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias

          For more information, see Key identifiers (KeyId) in the Key Manage-
          ment Service Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create a ledger with default properties

       The following create-ledger example creates  a  ledger  with  the  name
       myExampleLedger and the permissions mode STANDARD. The optional parame-
       ters for deletion protection and AWS KMS key are not specified, so they
       default to true and an AWS owned KMS key respectively.

          aws qldb create-ledger \
              --name myExampleLedger \
              --permissions-mode STANDARD

       Output:

          {
              "State": "CREATING",
              "Arn": "arn:aws:qldb:us-west-2:123456789012:ledger/myExampleLedger",
              "DeletionProtection": true,
              "CreationDateTime": 1568839243.951,
              "Name": "myExampleLedger",
              "PermissionsMode": "STANDARD"
          }

       Example 2: To create a ledger with deletion protection disabled, a cus-
       tomer managed KMS key, and specified tags

       The following create-ledger example creates  a  ledger  with  the  name
       myExampleLedger2  and  the permissions mode STANDARD. The deletion pro-
       tection feature is disabled, the specified customer managed KMS key  is
       used for encryption at rest, and the specified tags are attached to the
       resource.

          aws qldb create-ledger \
              --name myExampleLedger2 \
              --permissions-mode STANDARD \
              --no-deletion-protection \
              --kms-key arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 \
              --tags IsTest=true,Domain=Test

       Output:

          {
              "Arn": "arn:aws:qldb:us-west-2:123456789012:ledger/myExampleLedger2",
              "DeletionProtection": false,
              "CreationDateTime": 1568839543.557,
              "State": "CREATING",
              "Name": "myExampleLedger2",
              "PermissionsMode": "STANDARD",
              "KmsKeyArn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
          }

       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the ledger.

       State -> (string)
          The current status of the ledger.

       CreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and  time, in epoch time format, when the ledger was cre-
          ated. (Epoch time format is the  number  of  seconds  elapsed  since
          12:00:00 AM January 1, 1970 UTC.)

       PermissionsMode -> (string)
          The permissions mode of the ledger that you created.

       DeletionProtection -> (boolean)
          The  flag  that prevents a ledger from being deleted by any user. If
          not provided on ledger creation, this feature is enabled (true )  by
          default.

          If  deletion protection is enabled, you must first disable it before
          you can delete the ledger. You can disable it  by  calling  the  Up-
          dateLedger operation to set the flag to false .

       KmsKeyArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the customer managed KMS key that the ledger uses for en-
          cryption at rest. If this parameter is undefined, the ledger uses an
          Amazon Web Services owned KMS key for encryption.
