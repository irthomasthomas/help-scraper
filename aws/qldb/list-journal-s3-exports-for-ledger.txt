LIST-JOURNAL-S3-EXPORTS-FOR-LEDGER()      LIST-JOURNAL-S3-EXPORTS-FOR-LEDGER()



NAME
       list-journal-s3-exports-for-ledger -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns all journal export jobs for a specified ledger.

       This  action returns a maximum of MaxResults items, and is paginated so
       that you can retrieve all the items  by  calling  ListJournalS3Exports-
       ForLedger multiple times.

       This  action does not return any expired export jobs. For more informa-
       tion, see Export job expiration in the Amazon QLDB Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            list-journal-s3-exports-for-ledger
          --name <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the ledger.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in a single ListJournalS3Ex-
          portsForLedger request. (The actual number of results returned might
          be fewer.)

       --next-token (string)
          A pagination token, indicating that you want to  retrieve  the  next
          page  of  results.  If you received a value for NextToken in the re-
          sponse from a previous ListJournalS3ExportsForLedger call, then  you
          should use that value as input here.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                   zon S3) bucket.

                 o (Optional)  Use your customer managed key in Key Management
                   Service (KMS) for server-side encryption of  your  exported

          o If NextToken is not empty, then there are more results  available.
            To  retrieve  the next page of results, use the value of NextToken
            in a subsequent ListJournalS3ExportsForLedger call.
