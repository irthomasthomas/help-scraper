DESCRIBE-JOURNAL-KINESIS-STREAM()            DESCRIBE-JOURNAL-KINESIS-STREAM()



NAME
       describe-journal-kinesis-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  detailed information about a given Amazon QLDB journal stream.
       The output includes the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), stream  name,  cur-
       rent  status,  creation time, and the parameters of the original stream
       creation request.

       This action does not return any expired journal streams. For  more  in-
       formation,  see  Expiration for terminal streams in the Amazon QLDB De-
       veloper Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-journal-kinesis-stream
          --ledger-name <value>
          --stream-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ledger-name (string)
          The name of the ledger.

       --stream-id (string)
          The UUID (represented in Base62-encoded text) of  the  QLDB  journal
          stream to describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe a journal stream

       The  following describe-journal-kinesis-stream example displays the de-
       tails for the specified journal stream from a ledger.

          aws qldb describe-journal-kinesis-stream \
              --ledger-name myExampleLedger \
              --stream-id 7ISCkqwe4y25YyHLzYUFAf

       Output:

          {
              "Stream": {
                  "LedgerName": "myExampleLedger",
                  "CreationTime": 1591221984.677,
                  "InclusiveStartTime": 1590710400.0,

                      "AggregationEnabled": true
                  },
                  "StreamName": "myExampleLedger-stream"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Stream -> (structure)
          Information  about  the  QLDB  journal  stream  returned  by  a  De-
          scribeJournalS3Export request.

          LedgerName -> (string)
              The name of the ledger.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time, in epoch time format, when the  QLDB  journal
              stream  was created. (Epoch time format is the number of seconds
              elapsed since 12:00:00 AM January 1, 1970 UTC.)

          InclusiveStartTime -> (timestamp)
              The inclusive start date and time from which to start  streaming
              journal data.

          ExclusiveEndTime -> (timestamp)
              The exclusive date and time that specifies when the stream ends.
              If this parameter is undefined, the stream runs indefinitely un-
              til you cancel it.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that grants QLDB
              permissions for a journal stream to write data records to a  Ki-
              nesis Data Streams resource.

          StreamId -> (string)
              The  UUID (represented in Base62-encoded text) of the QLDB jour-
              nal stream.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the QLDB journal stream.

          Status -> (string)
              The current state of the QLDB journal stream.

          KinesisConfiguration -> (structure)
              The configuration settings of the Amazon  Kinesis  Data  Streams
              destination for a QLDB journal stream.

              StreamArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the Kinesis Data Streams
                 resource.

              AggregationEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Enables QLDB to publish multiple data records in a single Ki-
                 nesis  Data  Streams record, increasing the number of records
                 sent per API call.
                     This option is enabled by default. Record aggregation has
                     important  implications  for  processing  records and re-
                     quires de-aggregation in your stream consumer.  To  learn
                     more, see KPL Key Concepts and Consumer De-aggregation in
                     the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide .

              The error message that describes the reason that a stream has  a
              status of IMPAIRED or FAILED . This is not applicable to streams
              that have other status values.

          StreamName -> (string)
              The user-defined name of the QLDB journal stream.
