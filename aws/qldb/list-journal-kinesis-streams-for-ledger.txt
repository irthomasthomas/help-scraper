LIST-JOURNAL-KINESIS-STREAMS-FOR-LEDGLIST-JOURNAL-KINESIS-STREAMS-FOR-LEDGER()



NAME
       list-journal-kinesis-streams-for-ledger -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns all Amazon QLDB journal streams for a given ledger.

       This  action  does not return any expired journal streams. For more in-
       formation, see Expiration for terminal streams in the Amazon  QLDB  De-
       veloper Guide .

       This  action  returns a maximum of MaxResults items. It is paginated so
       that you can retrieve all  the  items  by  calling  ListJournalKinesis-
       StreamsForLedger multiple times.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

SYNOPSIS
            list-journal-kinesis-streams-for-ledger
          --ledger-name <value>

          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ledger-name (string)
          The name of the ledger.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in a single ListJournalKine-
          sisStreamsForLedger request. (The actual number of results  returned
          might be fewer.)

       --next-token (string)
          A  pagination  token,  indicating that you want to retrieve the next
          page of results. If you received a value for NextToken  in  the  re-
          sponse  from a previous ListJournalKinesisStreamsForLedger call, you
          should use that value as input here.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 The exclusive date and time that specifies  when  the  stream
                 ends. If this parameter is undefined, the stream runs indefi-

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM  role  that  grants

              StreamId -> (string)
                 The UUID (represented in Base62-encoded  text)  of  the  QLDB

                     Enables QLDB to publish multiple data records in a single
                     Kinesis Data Streams record,  increasing  the  number  of
                     records sent per API call.

                     Default: True

                     WARNING:
                        Record aggregation has important implications for pro-
                        cessing records and requires  de-aggregation  in  your
                        stream  consumer.  To learn more, see KPL Key Concepts
                        and Consumer De-aggregation in the Amazon Kinesis Data
                        Streams Developer Guide .

                 The error message that describes the reason that a stream has
                 a status of IMPAIRED or FAILED . This is  not  applicable  to
                 streams that have other status values.

              StreamName -> (string)
                 The user-defined name of the QLDB journal stream.

       NextToken -> (string)

          o If NextToken is empty, the last page of results has been processed
            and there are no more results to be retrieved.

          o If NextToken is not empty, more results are available. To retrieve
            the  next  page of results, use the value of NextToken in a subse-
            quent ListJournalKinesisStreamsForLedger call.
