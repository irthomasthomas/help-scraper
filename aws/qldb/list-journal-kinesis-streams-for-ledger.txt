LIST-JOURNAL-KINESIS-STREAMS-FOR-LEDGLIST-JOURNAL-KINESIS-STREAMS-FOR-LEDGER()



NAME
       list-journal-kinesis-streams-for-ledger -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  an  array  of all Amazon QLDB journal stream descriptors for a
       given ledger. The output of each stream descriptor  includes  the  same
       details that are returned by DescribeJournalKinesisStream .

       This  action  does not return any expired journal streams. For more in-
       formation, see Expiration for terminal streams in the Amazon  QLDB  De-
       veloper Guide .

       This  action  returns a maximum of MaxResults items. It is paginated so
       that you can retrieve all  the  items  by  calling  ListJournalKinesis-
       StreamsForLedger multiple times.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-journal-kinesis-streams-for-ledger
          --ledger-name <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ledger-name (string)
          The name of the ledger.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in a single ListJournalKine-
          sisStreamsForLedger request. (The actual number of results  returned
          might be fewer.)

       --next-token (string)
          A  pagination  token,  indicating that you want to retrieve the next
          page of results. If you received a value for NextToken  in  the  re-
          sponse  from a previous ListJournalKinesisStreamsForLedger call, you
          should use that value as input here.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       Streams -> (list)
          The array of QLDB journal stream  descriptors  that  are  associated
          with the given ledger.

          (structure)
              Information  about  an Amazon QLDB journal stream, including the
              Amazon Resource Name (ARN), stream name, creation time,  current
              status,  and  the parameters of the original stream creation re-
              quest.

              LedgerName -> (string)
                 The name of the ledger.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in epoch time format, when the QLDB  jour-
                 nal  stream  was created. (Epoch time format is the number of
                 seconds elapsed since 12:00:00 AM January 1, 1970 UTC.)

              InclusiveStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The inclusive start date and time from which to start stream-
                 ing journal data.

              ExclusiveEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  exclusive  date  and time that specifies when the stream
                 ends. If this parameter is undefined, the stream runs indefi-
                 nitely until you cancel it.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the IAM role that grants
                 QLDB permissions for a journal stream to write  data  records
                 to a Kinesis Data Streams resource.

              StreamId -> (string)
                 The  UUID  (represented  in  Base62-encoded text) of the QLDB
                 journal stream.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the QLDB journal stream.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current state of the QLDB journal stream.

              KinesisConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The configuration settings of the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
                 destination for a QLDB journal stream.

                 StreamArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  Kinesis Data
                     Streams resource.

                 AggregationEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Enables QLDB to publish multiple data records in a single
                     Kinesis  Data  Streams  record,  increasing the number of
                     records sent per API call.
                        This option is enabled by default. Record  aggregation
                        has  important implications for processing records and
                        requires de-aggregation in your  stream  consumer.  To
                        learn  more,  see KPL Key Concepts and Consumer De-ag-
                        gregation in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer
                        Guide .

              ErrorCause -> (string)
                 The error message that describes the reason that a stream has
                 a status of IMPAIRED or FAILED . This is  not  applicable  to
                 streams that have other status values.

              StreamName -> (string)
                 The user-defined name of the QLDB journal stream.

       NextToken -> (string)

          o If NextToken is empty, the last page of results has been processed
            and there are no more results to be retrieved.

          o If NextToken is not empty, more results are available. To retrieve
            the  next  page of results, use the value of NextToken in a subse-
            quent ListJournalKinesisStreamsForLedger call.
