              dence collection, along with related  parameters  and  metadata.
              This doesn't contain mappingID .

              sourceName -> (string)
                 The name of the control mapping data source.

              sourceDescription -> (string)
                 The  description of the data source that determines where Au-
                 dit Manager collects evidence from for the control.

              sourceSetUpOption -> (string)
                 The setup option for the data source, which reflects  if  the
                 evidence collection is automated or manual.

              sourceType -> (string)
                 Specifies  one of the five types of data sources for evidence
                 collection.

              sourceKeyword -> (structure)
                 The keyword to search for in CloudTrail logs,  Config  rules,
                 Security Hub checks, and Amazon Web Services API names.

                 keywordInputType -> (string)
                     The input method for the keyword.

                 keywordValue -> (string)
                     The  value of the keyword that's used when mapping a con-
                     trol data source. For example, this can be  a  CloudTrail
                     event  name,  a rule name for Config, a Security Hub con-
                     trol, or the name of an Amazon Web Services API call.

                     If youre mapping a data source to a rule in  Config,  the
                     keywordValue  that  you  specify  depends  on the type of
                     rule:

                     o For managed rules , you can use the rule identifier  as
                       the  keywordValue  .  You  can find the rule identifier
                       from the list of Config managed rules .

                       o Managed rule name:  s3-bucket-acl-prohibited     key-
                         wordValue : S3_BUCKET_ACL_PROHIBITED

                     o For  custom rules , you form the keywordValue by adding
                       the Custom_ prefix to the rule name. This  prefix  dis-
                       tinguishes the rule from a managed rule.

                       o Custom rule name: my-custom-config-rule  keywordValue
                         : Custom_my-custom-config-rule

                     o For service-linked rules , you form the keywordValue by
                       adding  the  Custom_  prefix to the rule name. In addi-
                       tion, you remove the suffix ID that appears at the  end
                       of the rule name.

                       o Service-linked  rule  name: CustomRuleForAccount-con-
                         formance-pack-szsm1uv0w  keywordValue  :  Custom_Cus-
                         tomRuleForAccount-conformance-pack

                       o Service-linked       rule       name:       security-
                         hub-api-gw-cache-encrypted-101104e1   keywordValue  :
                         Custom_securityhub-api-gw-cache-encrypted

                       o Service-linked       rule       name:       OrgConfi-
                         gRule-s3-bucket-versioning-enabled-dbgzf8ba  keyword-
                         Value : Custom_OrgConfigRule-s3-bucket-versioning-en-
                         abled

                 The frequency of evidence collection for the control  mapping
                 source.

              troubleshootingText -> (string)

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                        control data source. For example, this can be a Cloud-

                        Hub control, or the name of an Amazon Web Services API
                        call.

                        If  youre  mapping  a data source to a rule in Config,
                        the keywordValue that you specify depends on the  type
                        of rule:

                        o For  managed rules , you can use the rule identifier
                          as the keywordValue . You can find the rule  identi-
                          fier from the list of Config managed rules .

                          o Managed    rule   name:   s3-bucket-acl-prohibited
                            keywordValue : S3_BUCKET_ACL_PROHIBITED

                        o For custom rules ,  you  form  the  keywordValue  by
                          adding  the  Custom_  prefix  to the rule name. This
                          prefix distinguishes the rule from a managed rule.

                          o Custom rule name: my-custom-config-rule   keyword-
                            Value : Custom_my-custom-config-rule

                        o For service-linked rules , you form the keywordValue
                          by adding the Custom_ prefix to the  rule  name.  In
                          addition,  you  remove the suffix ID that appears at
                          the end of the rule name.

                          o Service-linked   rule    name:    CustomRuleForAc-
