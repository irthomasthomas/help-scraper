OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the control.

       --description (string)
          The description of the control.

       --testing-information (string)
          The steps to follow to determine if the control is satisfied.

       --action-plan-title (string)
          The title of the action plan for remediating the control.

       --action-plan-instructions (string)
          The recommended actions to carry out if the control isn't fulfilled.

       --control-mapping-sources (list)
          The data mapping sources for the control.

          (structure)
              The  mapping attributes that determine the evidence source for a
              given control, along with related parameters and metadata.  This
              doesn't contain mappingID .

              sourceName -> (string)
                 The name of the control mapping data source.

              sourceDescription -> (string)
                 The  description of the data source that determines where Au-
                 dit Manager collects evidence from for the control.

              sourceSetUpOption -> (string)
                 The setup option for the data source. This option reflects if
                 the evidence collection method is automated or manual. If you
                 dont provide a value for sourceSetUpOption  ,  Audit  Manager
                 automatically infers and populates the correct value based on
                 the sourceType that you specify.

              sourceType -> (string)
                 Specifies which type of data source is used to  collect  evi-
                 dence.

                 o The  source  can be an individual data source type, such as
                   AWS_Cloudtrail   ,   AWS_Config   ,   AWS_Security_Hub    ,
                   AWS_API_Call , or MANUAL .

                 o The  source can also be a managed grouping of data sources,
                   such as a Core_Control or a Common_Control .

              sourceKeyword -> (structure)
                 A keyword that relates to the control data source.

                 For manual evidence, this keyword indicates if the manual ev-
                 idence is a file or text.

                 For  automated  evidence,  this keyword identifies a specific
                 CloudTrail event, Config rule, Security Hub control, or  Ama-
                 zon Web Services API name.

                 To  learn  more about the supported keywords that you can use
                 when mapping a control data source, see the  following  pages
                 in the Audit Manager User Guide :

                 o Config rules supported by Audit Manager

                 o Security Hub controls supported by Audit Manager

                 o API calls supported by Audit Manager

                 o CloudTrail event names supported by Audit Manager

                 keywordInputType -> (string)
                     The input method for the keyword.

                     o SELECT_FROM_LIST is used when mapping a data source for
                       automated evidence.

                       o When keywordInputType is SELECT_FROM_LIST , a keyword
                         must  be  selected to collect automated evidence. For
                         example, this keyword can be a CloudTrail event name,
                         a  rule  name  for Config, a Security Hub control, or
                         the name of an Amazon Web Services API call.

                     o UPLOAD_FILE and INPUT_TEXT are only used when mapping a
                       data source for manual evidence.

                       o When keywordInputType is UPLOAD_FILE , a file must be
                         uploaded as manual evidence.

                       o When keywordInputType is INPUT_TEXT ,  text  must  be
                         entered as manual evidence.

                 keywordValue -> (string)
                     The  value of the keyword that's used when mapping a con-
                     trol data source. For example, this can be  a  CloudTrail
                     event  name,  a rule name for Config, a Security Hub con-
                     trol, or the name of an Amazon Web Services API call.

                     If youre mapping a data source to a rule in  Config,  the
                     keywordValue  that  you  specify  depends  on the type of
                     rule:

                     o For managed rules , you can use the rule identifier  as
                       the  keywordValue  .  You  can find the rule identifier
                       from the list of Config managed rules . For some rules,
                       the  rule  identifier  is different from the rule name.
                       For example, the rule name restricted-ssh has the  fol-
                       lowing  rule  identifier:  INCOMING_SSH_DISABLED . Make
                       sure to use the rule identifier,  not  the  rule  name.
                       Keyword example for managed rules:

                       o Managed  rule  name: s3-bucket-acl-prohibited    key-
                         wordValue : S3_BUCKET_ACL_PROHIBITED

                     o For custom rules , you form the keywordValue by  adding
                       the  Custom_  prefix to the rule name. This prefix dis-
                       tinguishes the custom rule from a managed  rule.   Key-
                       word example for custom rules:

                       o Custom rule name: my-custom-config-rule  keywordValue
                         : Custom_my-custom-config-rule

                     o For service-linked rules , you form the keywordValue by
                       adding  the  Custom_  prefix to the rule name. In addi-
                       tion, you remove the suffix ID that appears at the  end
                       of  the rule name.  Keyword examples for service-linked
                       rules:

                       o Service-linked rule  name:  CustomRuleForAccount-con-
                         formance-pack-szsm1uv0w   keywordValue  : Custom_Cus-
                         tomRuleForAccount-conformance-pack

                       o Service-linked       rule       name:       OrgConfi-
                         gRule-s3-bucket-versioning-enabled-dbgzf8ba  keyword-
                         Value : Custom_OrgConfigRule-s3-bucket-versioning-en-
                         abled

                     WARNING:
                        The  keywordValue  is  case  sensitive. If you enter a
                        value incorrectly, Audit Manager might  not  recognize
                        the  data  source  mapping. As a result, you might not
                        successfully collect evidence from that data source as
                        intended.

                        Keep  in mind the following requirements, depending on
                        the data source type that you're using.

                        o For Config:

                          o For managed rules, make sure that the keywordValue
                            is  the  rule  identifier  in ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDER-
                            SCORES  .  For  example,  CLOUDWATCH_LOG_GROUP_EN-
                            CRYPTED . For accuracy, we recommend that you ref-
                            erence the list of supported Config managed  rules
                            .

                          o For  custom rules, make sure that the keywordValue
                            has the Custom_ prefix followed by the custom rule
                            name.  The  format  of the custom rule name itself
                            may vary. For  accuracy,  we  recommend  that  you
                            visit  the  Config  console  to verify your custom
                            rule name.

                        o For Security Hub: The format varies for Security Hub
                          control  names.  For accuracy, we recommend that you
                          reference the list of supported  Security  Hub  con-
                          trols .

                        o For  Amazon  Web  Services API calls: Make sure that
                          the keywordValue is written as serviceprefix_Action-
                          Name  .  For example, iam_ListGroups . For accuracy,
                          we  recommend  that  you  reference  the   list   of
                          supported API calls .

                        o For  CloudTrail:  Make sure that the keywordValue is
                          written as serviceprefix_ActionName .  For  example,
                          cloudtrail_StartLogging . For accuracy, we recommend
                          that you review the Amazon Web  Service  prefix  and
                          action  names in the Service Authorization Reference
                          .

                 sourceKeyword -> (structure)
                     A keyword that relates to the control data source.

                     For manual evidence, this keyword indicates if the manual
                     evidence is a file or text.

                     For automated evidence, this keyword  identifies  a  spe-
                     cific  CloudTrail  event,  Config rule, Security Hub con-
                     trol, or Amazon Web Services API name.

                     To learn more about the supported keywords that  you  can
                     use when mapping a control data source, see the following

                     keywordInputType -> (string)
                        The input method for the keyword.

                        o SELECT_FROM_LIST is used when mapping a data  source
                          for automated evidence.

                          o When keywordInputType is SELECT_FROM_LIST , a key-
                            word must be selected to  collect  automated  evi-
                            dence.  For  example, this keyword can be a Cloud-
                            Trail event name, a rule name for Config, a  Secu-
                            rity  Hub  control,  or  the name of an Amazon Web
                            Services API call.

                        o UPLOAD_FILE and INPUT_TEXT are only used  when  map-
                          ping a data source for manual evidence.

                          o When keywordInputType is UPLOAD_FILE , a file must
                            be uploaded as manual evidence.

                          o When keywordInputType is INPUT_TEXT , text must be
                            entered as manual evidence.

                     keywordValue -> (string)
                        The  value  of  the keyword that's used when mapping a
                        control data source. For example, this can be a Cloud-
                        Trail  event  name, a rule name for Config, a Security
                        Hub control, or the name of an Amazon Web Services API
                        call.

                        If  youre  mapping  a data source to a rule in Config,
                        the keywordValue that you specify depends on the  type
                        of rule:

                        o For  managed rules , you can use the rule identifier
                          as the keywordValue . You can find the rule  identi-
                          fier  from  the  list  of Config managed rules . For
                          some rules, the rule identifier  is  different  from
                          the  rule  name.  For  example,  the  rule  name re-
                          stricted-ssh has the following rule identifier:  IN-
                          COMING_SSH_DISABLED  .  Make  sure  to  use the rule
                          identifier, not the rule name.  Keyword example  for
                          managed rules:

                          o Managed    rule   name:   s3-bucket-acl-prohibited
                            keywordValue : S3_BUCKET_ACL_PROHIBITED

                        o For custom rules ,  you  form  the  keywordValue  by
                          adding  the  Custom_  prefix  to the rule name. This
                          prefix distinguishes the custom rule from a  managed
                          rule.  Keyword example for custom rules:

                          o Custom  rule name: my-custom-config-rule  keyword-
                            Value : Custom_my-custom-config-rule

                        o For service-linked rules , you form the keywordValue
                          by  adding  the  Custom_ prefix to the rule name. In
                          addition, you remove the suffix ID that  appears  at
                          the end of the rule name.  Keyword examples for ser-
                          vice-linked rules:

                          o Service-linked   rule    name:    CustomRuleForAc-
                            count-conformance-pack-szsm1uv0w   keywordValue  :
                            Custom_CustomRuleForAccount-conformance-pack

                          o Service-linked      rule      name:      OrgConfi-
                            gRule-s3-bucket-versioning-enabled-dbgzf8ba   key-
                            wordValue  :   Custom_OrgConfigRule-s3-bucket-ver-
                            sioning-enabled

                        WARNING:
                            The keywordValue is case sensitive. If you enter a
                            value incorrectly, Audit Manager might not  recog-
                            nize  the  data  source  mapping. As a result, you
                            might not successfully collect evidence from  that
                            data source as intended.

                            Keep in mind the following requirements, depending
                            on the data source type that you're using.

                            o For Config:

                              o For managed rules, make sure that the keyword-
                                Value    is    the    rule    identifier    in
                                ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES   .   For   example,
                                CLOUDWATCH_LOG_GROUP_ENCRYPTED . For accuracy,
                                we recommend that you reference  the  list  of
                                supported Config managed rules .

                              o For  custom rules, make sure that the keyword-
                                Value has the Custom_ prefix followed  by  the
                                custom  rule  name.  The  format of the custom
                                rule name itself may vary.  For  accuracy,  we
                                recommend that you visit the Config console to
                                verify your custom rule name.

                            o For Security Hub: The format varies for Security
                              Hub  control  names.  For accuracy, we recommend
                              that you reference the list of  supported  Secu-
                              rity Hub controls .

                            o For  Amazon  Web  Services  API calls: Make sure
                              that the keywordValue is written as  servicepre-
                              fix_ActionName  .  For example, iam_ListGroups .
                              For accuracy, we recommend  that  you  reference
                              the list of supported API calls .

                            o For  CloudTrail: Make sure that the keywordValue
                              is written as serviceprefix_ActionName . For ex-
                              ample,  cloudtrail_StartLogging  . For accuracy,
                              we recommend that you review the Amazon Web Ser-
                              vice  prefix and action names in the Service Au-
                              thorization Reference .

                 sourceFrequency -> (string)
                     Specifies how often evidence is collected from  the  con-
                     trol mapping source.

                 troubleshootingText -> (string)
                     The instructions for troubleshooting the control.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The time when the control was created.

          lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time when the control was most recently updated.

          createdBy -> (string)
              The user or role that created the control.

          lastUpdatedBy -> (string)
              The user or role that most recently updated the control.

          tags -> (map)
              The tags associated with the control.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          state -> (string)
              The state of the control. The END_OF_SUPPORT state is applicable
              to standard controls only. This state indicates that  the  stan-
              dard  control  can  still be used to collect evidence, but Audit
              Manager is no longer updating or maintaining that control.
