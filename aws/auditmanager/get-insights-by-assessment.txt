OPTIONS
       --assessment-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the assessment.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       insights -> (structure)
          The  assessment  analytics data that the GetInsightsByAssessment API
          returned.

          noncompliantEvidenceCount -> (integer)
              The number of compliance check evidence that Audit Manager clas-
              sified  as  non-compliant.  This includes evidence that was col-
              lected from Security Hub with a Fail ruling, or  collected  from
              Config with a Non-compliant ruling.

          compliantEvidenceCount -> (integer)
              The number of compliance check evidence that Audit Manager clas-
              sified as compliant. This includes evidence that  was  collected
              from  Security  Hub with a Pass ruling, or collected from Config
              with a Compliant ruling.

          inconclusiveEvidenceCount -> (integer)
              The amount of evidence without a compliance check  ruling.  Evi-
              dence  is  inconclusive  if the associated control uses Security
              Hub or Config as a data source and you didn't enable those  ser-
              vices.  This  is  also  the case if a control uses a data source
              that doesnt support compliance checks (for example, manual  evi-
              dence, API calls, or CloudTrail).

              NOTE:
                 If evidence has a compliance check status of not applicable ,
                 it's classified as inconclusive in InsightsByAssessment data.

          assessmentControlsCountByNoncompliantEvidence -> (integer)
              The number of assessment controls that  collected  non-compliant
              evidence on the lastUpdated date.

          totalAssessmentControlsCount -> (integer)
              The total number of controls in the assessment.

          lastUpdated -> (timestamp)
              The time when the assessment insights were last updated.
