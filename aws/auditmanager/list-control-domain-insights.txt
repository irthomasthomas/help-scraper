LIST-CONTROL-DOMAIN-INSIGHTS()                  LIST-CONTROL-DOMAIN-INSIGHTS()



NAME
       list-control-domain-insights -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the latest analytics data for control domains across all of your
       active assessments.

       Audit Manager supports the control domains that are provided by  Amazon
       Web  Services Control Catalog. For information about how to find a list
       of     available     control     domains,     see     `     ListDomains
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controlcatalog/latest/APIReference/API_ListDomains.html`__
       in the Amazon Web Services Control Catalog API Reference.

       NOTE:
          A control domain is listed only if at  least  one  of  the  controls
          within  that  domain  collected  evidence on the lastUpdated date of
          controlDomainInsights . If this  condition  isnt  met,  no  data  is
          listed for that control domain.

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token that's used to fetch the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Represents the maximum number of results on a page or for an API re-
          quest call.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       controlDomainInsights -> (list)
          The control domain analytics data that the ListControlDomainInsights
          API returned.

          (structure)
              A summary of the latest analytics data for  a  specific  control
              domain.

              Control  domain  insights  are  grouped  by  control domain, and
              ranked by the highest total count of non-compliant evidence.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the control domain.

              id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the control domain.  Audit  Manager
                 supports  the control domains that are provided by Amazon Web
                 Services Control Catalog. For information about how to find a
                 list   of   available  control  domains,  see  `  ListDomains
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controlcatalog/latest/APIReference/API_ListDomains.html`__
                 in the Amazon Web Services Control Catalog API Reference.

              controlsCountByNoncompliantEvidence -> (integer)
                 The  number  of controls in the control domain that collected
                 non-compliant evidence on the lastUpdated date.

              totalControlsCount -> (integer)
                 The total number of controls in the control domain.

              evidenceInsights -> (structure)
                 A breakdown of the compliance check status for  the  evidence
                 thats associated with the control domain.

                 noncompliantEvidenceCount -> (integer)
                     The  number  of compliance check evidence that Audit Man-
                     ager classified as non-compliant. This includes  evidence
                     that  was collected from Security Hub with a Fail ruling,
                     or collected from Config with a Non-compliant ruling.

                 compliantEvidenceCount -> (integer)
                     The number of compliance check evidence that  Audit  Man-
                     ager classified as compliant. This includes evidence that
                     was collected from Security Hub with a  Pass  ruling,  or
                     collected from Config with a Compliant ruling.

                 inconclusiveEvidenceCount -> (integer)
                     The  number  of  evidence  that a compliance check ruling
                     isn't available for. Evidence is  inconclusive  when  the
                     associated  control uses Security Hub or Config as a data
                     source but you didn't enable those services. This is also
                     the  case  when  a control uses a data source that doesnt
                     support compliance checks (for example, manual  evidence,
                     API calls, or CloudTrail).

                     NOTE:
                        If  evidence  has a compliance check status of not ap-
                        plicable in the console, it's classified as  inconclu-
                        sive in EvidenceInsights data.

              lastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the control domain insights were last updated.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token that's used to fetch the next set of results.
