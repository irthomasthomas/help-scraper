OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the new assessment report.

       --description (string)
          The description of the assessment report.

       --assessment-id (string)
          The identifier for the assessment.

       --query-statement (string)
          A SQL statement that represents an evidence finder query.

          Provide  this  parameter when you want to generate an assessment re-
          port from the results of an evidence finder search query.  When  you
          use  this parameter, Audit Manager generates a one-time report using
          only the evidence from the query output. This report  does  not  in-
          clude  any  assessment  evidence that was manually added to a report
          using the console , or associated with a report using the API .

          To use this parameter, the enablementStatus of evidence finder  must
          be ENABLED .

          For  examples  and  help  resolving queryStatement validation excep-
          tions, see Troubleshooting evidence finder issues in the Audit  Man-
          ager User Guide.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
