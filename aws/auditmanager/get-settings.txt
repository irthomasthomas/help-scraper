OPTIONS
       --attribute (string)
          The list of setting attribute enum values.

          Possible values:

          o ALL

          o IS_AWS_ORG_ENABLED

          o SNS_TOPIC

          o DEFAULT_ASSESSMENT_REPORTS_DESTINATION

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       rides config/env settings.

                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CloudTrail  Lake  event
                 data  store  thats  used  by  evidence finder. The event data
                 store is the lake of evidence data that evidence finder  runs
                 queries against.

              enablementStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of the evidence finder feature and the re-
                 lated event data store.

                 o ENABLE_IN_PROGRESS means that you requested to enable  evi-
                   dence  finder.  An event data store is currently being cre-
                   ated to support evidence finder queries.

                 o ENABLED means that an event  data  store  was  successfully
                   created  and  evidence finder is enabled. We recommend that
                   you wait 7 days until the event data  store  is  backfilled
                   with  your  past  two years worth of evidence data. You can
                   use evidence finder in the meantime, but not all data might
                   be available until the backfill is complete.

                 o DISABLE_IN_PROGRESS means that you requested to disable ev-
                   idence finder, and your request is pending the deletion  of
                   the event data store.

                 o DISABLED  means that you have permanently disabled evidence
                   finder and the event data store has been deleted. You can't
                   re-enable evidence finder after this point.

              backfillStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of the evidence data backfill process.

                 The  backfill starts after you enable evidence finder. During
                 this task, Audit Manager populates an event data  store  with
                 your  past two years worth of evidence data so that your evi-
                 dence can be queried.

                 o NOT_STARTED means that the backfill hasnt started yet.

                 o IN_PROGRESS means that the backfill is  in  progress.  This
                   can  take up to 7 days to complete, depending on the amount
                   of evidence data.

                 o COMPLETED means that the backfill is complete. All of  your
                   past evidence is now queryable.

              error -> (string)
                 Represents  any  errors  that  occurred when enabling or dis-
                 abling evidence finder.

          deregistrationPolicy -> (structure)
              The deregistration policy for your Audit Manager data.  You  can
              use  this  attribute  to determine how your data is handled when
              you deregister Audit Manager.

              deleteResources -> (string)
                 Specifies which Audit Manager data will be deleted  when  you
                 deregister Audit Manager.

                 o If  you  set the value to ALL , all of your data is deleted
                   within seven days of deregistration.

                 o If you set the value to DEFAULT ,  none  of  your  data  is
                   deleted  at  the  time  of deregistration. However, keep in
                   mind that the Audit Manager data retention policy still ap-
                   plies.  As  a result, any evidence data will be deleted two
                   years after its creation date. Your other Audit Manager re-
                   sources will continue to exist indefinitely.
