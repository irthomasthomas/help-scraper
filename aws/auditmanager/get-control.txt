OPTIONS
       --control-id (string)
          The identifier for the control.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,

                     To  learn  more about the supported keywords that you can
                     use when mapping a control data source, see the following
                     pages in the Audit Manager User Guide :

                     o Config rules supported by Audit Manager

                     o Security Hub controls supported by Audit Manager

                     o API calls supported by Audit Manager

                     o CloudTrail event names supported by Audit Manager

                     keywordInputType -> (string)
                        The input method for the keyword.

                     keywordValue -> (string)
                        The  value  of  the keyword that's used when mapping a
                        control data source. For example, this can be a Cloud-
                        Trail  event  name, a rule name for Config, a Security
                        Hub control, or the name of an Amazon Web Services API
                        call.

                        If  youre  mapping  a data source to a rule in Config,
                        the keywordValue that you specify depends on the  type
                        of rule:

                        o For  managed rules , you can use the rule identifier
                          as the keywordValue . You can find the rule  identi-
                          fier from the list of Config managed rules .

                          o Managed    rule   name:   s3-bucket-acl-prohibited
                            keywordValue : S3_BUCKET_ACL_PROHIBITED

                        o For custom rules ,  you  form  the  keywordValue  by
                          adding  the  Custom_  prefix  to the rule name. This
                          prefix distinguishes the rule from a managed rule.

                          o Custom rule name: my-custom-config-rule   keyword-
                            Value : Custom_my-custom-config-rule

                        o For service-linked rules , you form the keywordValue
                          by adding the Custom_ prefix to the  rule  name.  In
                          addition,  you  remove the suffix ID that appears at
                          the end of the rule name.

                          o Service-linked   rule    name:    CustomRuleForAc-
                            count-conformance-pack-szsm1uv0w   keywordValue  :
                            Custom_CustomRuleForAccount-conformance-pack

                          o Service-linked      rule      name:      OrgConfi-

                            sioning-enabled

                 sourceFrequency -> (string)
                     The frequency of evidence collection for the control map-
                     ping source.

                 troubleshootingText -> (string)
                     The instructions for troubleshooting the control.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The time when the control was created.

          lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time when the control was most recently updated.

          createdBy -> (string)
              The user or role that created the control.

          lastUpdatedBy -> (string)
              The user or role that most recently updated the control.

          tags -> (map)
              The tags associated with the control.
