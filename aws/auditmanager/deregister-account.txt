DEREGISTER-ACCOUNT()                                      DEREGISTER-ACCOUNT()



NAME
       deregister-account -

DESCRIPTION
       Deregisters an account in Audit Manager.

       NOTE:
          When  you deregister your account from Audit Manager, your data isnt
          deleted. If you want to delete your resource data, you must  perform
          that task separately before you deregister your account. Either, you
          can do this in the Audit Manager console. Or, you can use one of the
          delete API operations that are provided by Audit Manager.

          To  delete  your  Audit Manager resource data, see the following in-
          structions:

          o DeleteAssessment (see also: Deleting an assessment  in  the  Audit
            Manager User Guide )

          o DeleteAssessmentFramework  (see  also: Deleting a custom framework
            in the Audit Manager User Guide )

          o DeleteAssessmentFrameworkShare (see also: Deleting a share request
            in the Audit Manager User Guide )

          o DeleteAssessmentReport (see also: Deleting an assessment report in
            the Audit Manager User Guide )

          o DeleteControl (see also: Deleting a custom control  in  the  Audit
            Manager User Guide )

          At this time, Audit Manager doesn't provide an option to delete evi-
          dence. All available delete operations are listed above.

SYNOPSIS
            deregister-account
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       status -> (string)
          The registration status of the account.
