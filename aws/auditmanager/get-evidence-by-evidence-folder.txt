OPTIONS
       --assessment-id (string)
          The identifier for the assessment.

       --control-set-id (string)
          The identifier for the control set.

       --evidence-folder-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the folder that the evidence is stored in.

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token that's used to fetch the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Represents the maximum number of results on a page or for an API re-
          quest call.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

                 The  timestamp  that  represents  when  the evidence was col-
                 lected.

              eventSource -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Service that the evidence is collected from.

              eventName -> (string)
                 The name of the evidence event.

              evidenceByType -> (string)
                 The type of automated evidence.

              resourcesIncluded -> (list)
                 The list of resources that are assessed to generate the  evi-
                 dence.

                 (structure)
                     A  system  asset that's evaluated in an Audit Manager as-
                     sessment.

                     arn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource.

                     value -> (string)
                        The value of the resource.

                     complianceCheck -> (string)
                        The evaluation status for a resource that was assessed
                        when collecting compliance check evidence.

                        o Audit  Manager classes the resource as non-compliant
                          if Security Hub reports a Fail result, or if  Config
                          reports a Non-compliant result.

                        o Audit  Manager  classes the resource as compliant if
                          Security Hub reports a Pass result, or if Config re-
                          ports a Compliant result.

                        o If a compliance check isn't available or applicable,
                          then no compliance evaluation can be made  for  that
                          resource.  This is the case if a resource assessment
                          uses Config or Security Hub as the  underlying  data
                          source type, but those services aren't enabled. This
                          is also the case if the resource assessment uses  an
                          underlying  data  source  type  that doesn't support
                          compliance checks (such as manual  evidence,  Amazon
                          Web Services API calls, or CloudTrail).

              attributes -> (map)
                 The  names  and  values  that are used by the evidence event.
                 This  includes  an  attribute  name   (such   as   allowUser-
                 sToChangePassword ) and value (such as true or false ).

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              iamId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the IAM user or role that's associ-
                 ated with the evidence.

              complianceCheck -> (string)
                 The evaluation status for automated evidence that falls under
                 the compliance check category.

                 o Audit Manager classes evidence as non-compliant if Security
                   Hub reports a Fail result, or if Config reports a  Non-com-
                   pliant result.

                 o Audit Manager classes evidence as compliant if Security Hub
                   reports a Pass result, or if Config reports a Compliant re-
                   sult.

                 o If  a  compliance check isn't available or applicable, then
                   no compliance evaluation can be  made  for  that  evidence.
                   This  is  the  case if the evidence uses Config or Security
                   Hub as the underlying data source type, but those  services
                   aren't  enabled. This is also the case if the evidence uses
                   an underlying data source type that doesn't support compli-
                   ance  checks  (such as manual evidence, Amazon Web Services
                   API calls, or CloudTrail).

              awsOrganization -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account that  the  evidence  is  col-
                 lected from, and its organization path.

              awsAccountId -> (string)
                 The identifier for the Amazon Web Services account.

              evidenceFolderId -> (string)
                 The identifier for the folder that the evidence is stored in.

              id -> (string)
                 The identifier for the evidence.

              assessmentReportSelection -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether the evidence is included in the assessment
                 report.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token that's used to fetch the next set of results.
