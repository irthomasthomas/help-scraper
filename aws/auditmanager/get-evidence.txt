OPTIONS
       --assessment-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the assessment.

       --control-set-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the control set.

       --evidence-folder-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the folder that the evidence is stored in.

       --evidence-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the evidence.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       evidence -> (structure)
          The evidence that the GetEvidence API returned.

          dataSource -> (string)
              The data source where the evidence was collected from.

          evidenceAwsAccountId -> (string)
              The identifier for the Amazon Web Services account.

          time -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp that represents when the evidence was collected.

          eventSource -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Service that the evidence is collected from.

          eventName -> (string)
              The name of the evidence event.

          evidenceByType -> (string)
              The type of automated evidence.

          resourcesIncluded -> (list)
              The list of resources that are assessed  to  generate  the  evi-
              dence.

              (structure)
                 A  system  asset that's evaluated in an Audit Manager assess-
                 ment.

                 arn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource.

                 value -> (string)
                     The value of the resource.

                 complianceCheck -> (string)
                     The evaluation status for a resource  that  was  assessed
                     when collecting compliance check evidence.

                     o Audit  Manager classes the resource as non-compliant if
                       Security Hub reports a Fail result, or  if  Config  re-
                       ports a Non-compliant result.

                     o Audit  Manager classes the resource as compliant if Se-
                       curity Hub reports a Pass result, or if Config  reports
                       a Compliant result.

                     o If  a  compliance  check isn't available or applicable,
                       then no compliance evaluation can be made for that  re-
                       source.  This is the case if a resource assessment uses
                       Config or Security Hub as the  underlying  data  source
                       type,  but  those services aren't enabled. This is also
                       the case if the resource assessment uses an  underlying
                       data source type that doesn't support compliance checks
                       (such as  manual  evidence,  Amazon  Web  Services  API
                       calls, or CloudTrail).

          attributes -> (map)
              The  names  and values that are used by the evidence event. This
              includes an attribute name (such as allowUsersToChangePassword )
              and value (such as true or false ).

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          iamId -> (string)
              The  unique  identifier  for  the user or role that's associated
              with the evidence.

          complianceCheck -> (string)
              The evaluation status for automated evidence  that  falls  under
              the compliance check category.

              o Audit  Manager  classes  evidence as non-compliant if Security
                Hub reports a Fail result, or if Config reports a  Non-compli-
                ant result.

              o Audit  Manager  classes  evidence as compliant if Security Hub
                reports a Pass result, or if Config reports  a  Compliant  re-
                sult.

              o If  a  compliance check isn't available or applicable, then no
                compliance evaluation can be made for that evidence.  This  is
                the  case  if  the evidence uses Config or Security Hub as the
                underlying data source type, but  those  services  aren't  en-
                abled.  This is also the case if the evidence uses an underly-
                ing data source type that doesn't  support  compliance  checks
                (such  as  manual  evidence, Amazon Web Services API calls, or
                CloudTrail).

          awsOrganization -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services account that the evidence  is  collected
              from, and its organization path.

          awsAccountId -> (string)
              The identifier for the Amazon Web Services account.

          evidenceFolderId -> (string)
              The identifier for the folder that the evidence is stored in.

          id -> (string)
              The identifier for the evidence.

          assessmentReportSelection -> (string)
              Specifies whether the evidence is included in the assessment re-
              port.
