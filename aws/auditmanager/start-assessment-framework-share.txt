NAME
       start-assessment-framework-share -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a share request for a custom framework in Audit Manager.

       The share request specifies a recipient and notifies them that a custom
       framework is available. Recipients have 120 days to accept  or  decline
       the request. If no action is taken, the share request expires.

       When  you  create  a  share request, Audit Manager stores a snapshot of
       your custom framework in the US East (N. Virginia) Amazon Web  Services
       Region.  Audit Manager also stores a backup of the same snapshot in the
       US West (Oregon) Amazon Web Services Region.

       Audit Manager deletes the snapshot and the backup snapshot when one  of
       the following events occurs:

       o The sender revokes the share request.

       o The recipient declines the share request.

       o The recipient encounters an error and doesn't successfully accept the
         share request.

       o The share request expires before the recipient responds  to  the  re-
         quest.

       When  a  sender resends a share request , the snapshot is replaced with
       an updated version that corresponds with the latest version of the cus-
       tom framework.

       When  a  recipient  accepts a share request, the snapshot is replicated
       into their Amazon Web Services account under the  Amazon  Web  Services
       Region that was specified in the share request.

       WARNING:
          When you invoke the StartAssessmentFrameworkShare API, you are about
          to share a custom framework with another  Amazon  Web  Services  ac-
          count.  You  may not share a custom framework that is derived from a
          standard framework if the standard framework is  designated  as  not
          eligible  for  sharing  by  Amazon Web Services, unless you have ob-
          tained permission to do so from the owner of the standard framework.
          To learn more about which standard frameworks are eligible for shar-
          ing, see Framework sharing eligibility in  the  Audit  Manager  User
          Guide .

OPTIONS
       --framework-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the custom framework to be shared.

       --destination-account (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account of the recipient.

       --destination-region (string)
          The Amazon Web Services Region of the recipient.

       --comment (string)
          An optional comment from the sender about the share request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
