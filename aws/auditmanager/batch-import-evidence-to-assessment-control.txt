OPTIONS
       --assessment-id (string)
          The identifier for the assessment.

       --control-set-id (string)

       --control-id (string)
          The identifier for the control.

       --manual-evidence (list)
          The list of manual evidence objects.

          (structure)
              Evidence  that's  manually  added to a control in Audit Manager.
              manualEvidence can be one of the following:  evidenceFileName  ,
              s3ResourcePath , or textResponse .

              s3ResourcePath -> (string)
                 The S3 URL of the object that's imported as manual evidence.

              textResponse -> (string)
                 The  plain  text  response that's entered and saved as manual
                 evidence.

              evidenceFileName -> (string)
                 The name of the file that's uploaded as manual evidence. This
                 name is populated using the evidenceFileName value from the `
                 GetEvidenceFileUploadUrl
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/APIReference/API_GetEvidenceFileUploadUrl.html`__
                 API response.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          s3ResourcePath=string,textResponse=string,evidenceFileName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "s3ResourcePath": "string",
              "textResponse": "string",
              "evidenceFileName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
