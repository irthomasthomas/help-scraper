              A  collection  of  attributes that's used to create a delegation
              for an assessment in Audit Manager.

              comment -> (string)
                 A comment that's related to the delegation request.

              controlSetId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the control set.

              roleArn -> (string)

              roleType -> (string)
                 The type of customer persona.

                 NOTE:
                     In CreateAssessment , roleType can only be  PROCESS_OWNER
                     .

                     In UpdateSettings , roleType can only be PROCESS_OWNER .

                     In  BatchCreateDelegationByAssessment , roleType can only
                     be RESOURCE_OWNER .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          comment=string,controlSetId=string,roleArn=string,roleType=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "comment": "string",
              "controlSetId": "string",
              "roleArn": "string",
              "roleType": "PROCESS_OWNER"|"RESOURCE_OWNER"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --assessment-id (string)
          The identifier for the assessment.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
