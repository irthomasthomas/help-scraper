OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       insights -> (structure)
          The analytics data that the GetInsights API returned.

          activeAssessmentsCount -> (integer)
              The number of active assessments in Audit Manager.

          noncompliantEvidenceCount -> (integer)
              The number of compliance check evidence that Audit Manager clas-
              sified  as  non-compliant on the lastUpdated date. This includes
              evidence that was collected from Security Hub with a  Fail  rul-
              ing, or collected from Config with a Non-compliant ruling.

          compliantEvidenceCount -> (integer)
              The number of compliance check evidence that Audit Manager clas-
              sified as compliant on the lastUpdated date. This includes  evi-
              dence  that  was collected from Security Hub with a Pass ruling,
              or collected from Config with a Compliant ruling.

          inconclusiveEvidenceCount -> (integer)
              The number of evidence without a compliance check  ruling.  Evi-
              dence  is inconclusive when the associated control uses Security
              Hub or Config as a data source but you didn't enable those  ser-
              vices.  This  is also the case when a control uses a data source
              that doesnt support compliance checks (for example: manual  evi-
              dence, API calls, or CloudTrail).

              NOTE:
                 If evidence has a compliance check status of not applicable ,
                 it's classed as inconclusive in Insights data.

          assessmentControlsCountByNoncompliantEvidence -> (integer)
              The number of assessment controls that  collected  non-compliant
              evidence on the lastUpdated date.

          totalAssessmentControlsCount -> (integer)
              The total number of controls across all active assessments.

          lastUpdated -> (timestamp)
              The time when the cross-assessment insights were last updated.
