              controls -> (list)
                 The  list  of  controls  within the control set. This doesn't
                 contain the control set ID.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                                   dit Manager automatically infers and  popu-
                                   lates   the  correct  value  based  on  the
                                   sourceType that you specify.

                               sourceType -> (string)

                                     source type,  such  as  AWS_Cloudtrail  ,
                                     AWS_Config     ,    AWS_Security_Hub    ,

                                   o The source can also be a managed grouping
                                     of  data  sources, such as a Core_Control

                                   source.

                                   For manual evidence, this keyword indicates
                                   if the manual evidence is a file or text.

                                   For automated evidence, this keyword  iden-
                                   tifies  a specific CloudTrail event, Config
                                   rule, Security Hub control, or  Amazon  Web
                                   Services API name.

                                   that you can use  when  mapping  a  control
                                   data source, see the following pages in the
                                   Audit Manager User Guide :

                                   o Config rules supported by Audit Manager

                                   o Security Hub controls supported by  Audit
                                     Manager

                                   keywordInputType -> (string)
                                      The input method for the keyword.

                                      o SELECT_FROM_LIST is used when  mapping
                                        a data source for automated evidence.

                                        o When    keywordInputType    is   SE-
                                          LECT_FROM_LIST , a keyword  must  be
                                          selected  to  collect automated evi-
                                          dence. For example, this keyword can
                                          be  a  CloudTrail event name, a rule
                                          name for Config, a Security Hub con-
                                          trol,  or  the name of an Amazon Web
                                          Services API call.

                                      o UPLOAD_FILE and  INPUT_TEXT  are  only
                                        used  when  mapping  a data source for
                                        manual evidence.

                                        o When keywordInputType is UPLOAD_FILE
                                          ,  a file must be uploaded as manual
                                          evidence.

                                        o When keywordInputType is  INPUT_TEXT
                                          , text must be entered as manual ev-
                                          idence.

                                   keywordValue -> (string)
                                      The value of  the  keyword  that's  used
                                      when  mapping a control data source. For
                                      example, this can be a CloudTrail  event
                                      name, a rule name for Config, a Security
                                      Hub control, or the name  of  an  Amazon
                                      Web Services API call.

                                      If youre mapping a data source to a rule
                                      in Config,  the  keywordValue  that  you
                                      specify depends on the type of rule:

                                      o For  managed  rules  , you can use the
                                        rule identifier as the keywordValue  .
                                        You  can find the rule identifier from
                                        the list of Config managed rules . For
                                        some  rules,  the  rule  identifier is
                                        different from the rule name. For  ex-
                                        ample,  the  rule  name restricted-ssh
                                        has the following rule identifier: IN-
                                        COMING_SSH_DISABLED . Make sure to use
                                        the  rule  identifier,  not  the  rule
                                        name.   Keyword  example  for  managed
                                        rules:

                                        o Managed          rule          name:

                                      o For custom rules , you form  the  key-
                                        wordValue by adding the Custom_ prefix
                                        to the rule name. This prefix  distin-
                                        guishes the custom rule from a managed
                                        rule.   Keyword  example  for   custom
                                        rules:

                                      o For  service-linked  rules  , you form
                                        the keywordValue by adding the Custom_
                                        prefix  to the rule name. In addition,
                                        you remove the suffix ID that  appears
