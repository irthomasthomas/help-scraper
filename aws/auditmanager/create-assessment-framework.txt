       --control-sets (list)
          The control sets that are associated with the framework.

          (structure)
              A controlSet entity that represents a collection of controls  in
              Audit Manager. This doesn't contain the control set ID.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the control set.

              controls -> (list)
                 The  list  of  controls  within the control set. This doesn't
                 contain the control set ID.

                 (structure)
                     The control entity attributes that uniquely  identify  an
                     existing control to be added to a framework in Audit Man-
                     ager.

                     id -> (string)
                        The unique identifier of the control.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,controls=[{id=string},{id=string}] ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "controls": [
                {
                  "id": "string"
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --tags (map)

          key -> (string)

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                                      If youre mapping a data source to a rule
                                      in  Config,  the  keywordValue  that you
                                      specify depends on the type of rule:

                                      o For managed rules , you  can  use  the
                                        rule  identifier as the keywordValue .
                                        You can find the rule identifier  from
                                        the list of Config managed rules .

                                        o Managed          rule          name:
                                          s3-bucket-acl-prohibited    keyword-
                                          Value : S3_BUCKET_ACL_PROHIBITED

                                      o For  custom  rules , you form the key-
                                        wordValue by adding the Custom_ prefix
                                        to  the rule name. This prefix distin-
                                        guishes the rule from a managed rule.

                                        o Custom  rule  name:   my-custom-con-

                                      o For service-linked rules  ,  you  form
                                        the keywordValue by adding the Custom_
                                        prefix to the rule name. In  addition,
                                        you  remove the suffix ID that appears
                                        at the end of the rule name.

                                        o Service-linked  rule  name:  Custom-
