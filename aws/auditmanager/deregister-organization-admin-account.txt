NAME
       deregister-organization-admin-account -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes the specified Amazon Web Services account as a delegated admin-
       istrator for Audit Manager.

       When you remove a delegated administrator from your Audit Manager  set-
       tings,  you continue to have access to the evidence that you previously
       collected under that account. This is also the case when you deregister
       a  delegated  administrator  from Organizations. However, Audit Manager
       stops collecting and attaching evidence to that delegated administrator
       account moving forward.

       WARNING:
          Keep in mind the following cleanup task if you use evidence finder:

          Before  you use your management account to remove a delegated admin-
          istrator, make sure that the current delegated administrator account
          signs  in  to Audit Manager and disables evidence finder first. Dis-
          abling evidence finder automatically deletes the  event  data  store
          that was created in their account when they enabled evidence finder.
          If this task isnt completed, the event data store remains  in  their
          account.  In this case, we recommend that the original delegated ad-
          ministrator goes to CloudTrail Lake and manually deletes  the  event
          data store .

          This  cleanup task is necessary to ensure that you don't end up with
          multiple event data stores. Audit Manager ignores  an  unused  event
          data  store after you remove or change a delegated administrator ac-
          count. However, the unused event data store continues to incur stor-
          age costs from CloudTrail Lake if you don't delete it.

       When  you  deregister  a delegated administrator account for Audit Man-
       ager, the data for that account isnt deleted. If you want to delete re-
       source  data  for  a  delegated administrator account, you must perform
       that task separately before you deregister the account. Either, you can
       do this in the Audit Manager console. Or, you can use one of the delete
       API operations that are provided by Audit Manager.

       To delete your Audit Manager resource data, see the following  instruc-
       tions:

       o DeleteAssessment  (see also: Deleting an assessment in the Audit Man-
         ager User Guide )

       o DeleteAssessmentFramework (see also: Deleting a custom  framework  in
         the Audit Manager User Guide )

       o DeleteAssessmentFrameworkShare (see also: Deleting a share request in
         the Audit Manager User Guide )

       o DeleteAssessmentReport (see also: Deleting an  assessment  report  in
         the Audit Manager User Guide )

       o DeleteControl  (see also: Deleting a custom control in the Audit Man-
         ager User Guide )

       At this time, Audit Manager doesn't provide an option  to  delete  evi-
       dence  for  a specific delegated administrator. Instead, when your man-
       agement account deregisters Audit Manager, we perform a cleanup for the
       current delegated administrator account at the time of deregistration.

OPTIONS
       --admin-account-id (string)
          The identifier for the administrator account.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
