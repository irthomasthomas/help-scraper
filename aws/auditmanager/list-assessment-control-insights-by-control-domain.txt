LIST-ASSESSMENT-CONTROL-INLIST-ASSESSMENT-CONTROL-INSIGHTS-BY-CONTROL-DOMAIN()



NAME
       list-assessment-control-insights-by-control-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the latest analytics data for controls within a specific control
       domain and a specific active assessment.

       NOTE:
          Control insights are listed only if the control belongs to the  con-
          trol domain and assessment that was specified. Moreover, the control
          must have collected evidence on the lastUpdated date  of  controlIn-
          sightsByAssessment . If neither of these conditions are met, no data
          is listed for that control.

OPTIONS
       --control-domain-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the control domain.

          Audit Manager supports the control domains that are provided by Ama-
          zon  Web Services Control Catalog. For information about how to find
          a  list  of   available   control   domains,   see   `   ListDomains
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controlcatalog/latest/APIReference/API_ListDomains.html`__
          in the Amazon Web Services Control Catalog API Reference.

       --assessment-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the active assessment.

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token that's used to fetch the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Represents the maximum number of results on a page or for an API re-
          quest call.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       controlInsightsByAssessment -> (list)
          The assessment control analytics data  that  the  ListAssessmentCon-
          trolInsightsByControlDomain API returned.

          (structure)
              A summary of the latest analytics data for a specific control in
              a specific active assessment.

              Control insights are grouped by control domain,  and  ranked  by
              the highest total count of non-compliant evidence.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the assessment control.

              id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the assessment control.

              evidenceInsights -> (structure)
                 A  breakdown  of the compliance check status for the evidence
                 thats associated with the assessment control.

                 noncompliantEvidenceCount -> (integer)
                     The number of compliance check evidence that  Audit  Man-
                     ager  classified as non-compliant. This includes evidence
                     that was collected from Security Hub with a Fail  ruling,
                     or collected from Config with a Non-compliant ruling.

                 compliantEvidenceCount -> (integer)
                     The  number  of compliance check evidence that Audit Man-
                     ager classified as compliant. This includes evidence that
                     was  collected  from  Security Hub with a Pass ruling, or
                     collected from Config with a Compliant ruling.

                 inconclusiveEvidenceCount -> (integer)
                     The number of evidence that  a  compliance  check  ruling
                     isn't  available  for.  Evidence is inconclusive when the
                     associated control uses Security Hub or Config as a  data
                     source but you didn't enable those services. This is also
                     the case when a control uses a data  source  that  doesnt
                     support  compliance checks (for example, manual evidence,
                     API calls, or CloudTrail).

                     NOTE:
                        If evidence has a compliance check status of  not  ap-
                        plicable  in the console, it's classified as inconclu-
                        sive in EvidenceInsights data.

              controlSetName -> (string)
                 The name of the control set that the assessment  control  be-
                 longs to.

              lastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  when the assessment control insights were last up-
                 dated.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token that's used to fetch the next set of results.
