DELETE-PACKAGE-VERSIONS()                            DELETE-PACKAGE-VERSIONS()



NAME
       delete-package-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  one  or  more versions of a package. A deleted package version
       cannot be restored in your repository. If you want to remove a  package
       version  from  your repository and be able to restore it later, set its
       status to Archived . Archived packages  cannot  be  downloaded  from  a
       repository  and  don't  show  up  with  list package APIs (for example,
       ListPackageVersions   ),   but   you    can    restore    them    using
       UpdatePackageVersionsStatus .

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain that contains the package to delete.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The  12-digit account number of the Amazon Web Services account that
          owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          The name of the repository that contains  the  package  versions  to
          delete.

       --format (string)
          The format of the package versions to delete.

          Possible values:

          o npm

          o pypi

          o maven

          o nuget

       --namespace (string)
          The  namespace  of  the  package versions to be deleted. The package
          version component that specifies its namespace depends on its  type.
          For example:

          o The  namespace  of  a  Maven  package version is its groupId . The
            namespace is required when deleting Maven package versions.

          o The namespace of an npm package version is its scope .

          o Python and NuGet package versions do not contain  a  corresponding
            component,  package  versions of those formats do not have a name-
            space.

       --package (string)
          The name of the package with the versions to delete.

       --versions (list)
          An array of strings that specify the  versions  of  the  package  to
          delete.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --expected-status (string)
          The expected status of the package version to delete.

          Possible values:

          o Published

          o Unfinished

          o Unlisted

          o Archived

          o Disposed

          o Deleted

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete package versions

       The  following delete-package-versions example deletes version 4.0.0 of
       a package named test-package.

          aws codeartifact delete-package-versions \
              --domain test-domain \
              --repo test-repo \
              --format npm \
              --package test-package \
              --versions 4.0.0

       Output:

          {
              "successfulVersions": {
                  "4.0.0": {
                      "revision": "Ciqe5/9yicvkJT13b5/LdLpCyE6fqA7poa9qp+FilPs=",
                      "status": "Deleted"
                  }
              },
              "failedVersions": {}
          }
