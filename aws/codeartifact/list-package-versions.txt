LIST-PACKAGE-VERSIONS()                                LIST-PACKAGE-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-package-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of PackageVersionSummary objects for package versions in
       a repository that match the request parameters. Package versions of all
       statuses will be returned by default when calling list-package-versions
       with no --status parameter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-package-versions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: versions

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The  name  of  the domain that contains the repository that contains
          the requested package versions.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the Amazon Web Services account  that
          owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          The  name of the repository that contains the requested package ver-
          sions.

       --format (string)
          The format of the returned package versions.

          Possible values:

          o npm

          o pypi

          o maven

          o nuget

       --namespace (string)
          The namespace of the package that  contains  the  requested  package
          versions. The package component that specifies its namespace depends
          on its type. For example:

          o The namespace of a Maven package is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm package is its scope .

          o Python and NuGet packages do not contain  a  corresponding  compo-
            nent, packages of those formats do not have a namespace.

       --package (string)
          The  name  of the package for which you want to request package ver-
          sions.

       --status (string)
          A string that filters the requested package versions by status.

          Possible values:

          o Published

          o Unfinished

          o Unlisted

          o Archived

          o Disposed

          o Deleted

       --sort-by (string)
          How to sort the requested list of package versions.

          Possible values:

          o PUBLISHED_TIME

       --origin-type (string)
          The originType used to filter package versions.  Only  package  ver-
          sions with the provided originType will be returned.

          Possible values:

          o INTERNAL

          o EXTERNAL

          o UNKNOWN

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list package versions for a package

       The following list-package-versions example returns a list  of  package
       versions for a package named kind-of.

          aws codeartifact list-package-versions \
              --package kind-of \
              --domain test-domain \
              --repository test-repo \
              --format npm

       Output:

          {
              "defaultDisplayVersion": "1.0.1",
              "format": "npm",
              "package": "kind-of",
              "versions": [
                  {

OUTPUT
       defaultDisplayVersion -> (string)
          The default package version to display. This depends on the  package
          format:

          o For  Maven  and  PyPI  packages,  it's the most recently published
            package version.

          o For npm packages, it's the version referenced by the  latest  tag.
            If  the  latest  tag  is not set, it's the most recently published
            package version.

       format -> (string)
          A format of the package.

       namespace -> (string)
          The namespace of the package that  contains  the  requested  package
          versions. The package component that specifies its namespace depends
          on its type. For example:

          o The namespace of a Maven package is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm package is its scope .

          o Python and NuGet packages do not contain  a  corresponding  compo-
            nent, packages of those formats do not have a namespace.

       package -> (string)
          The name of the package.

       versions -> (list)
          The returned list of PackageVersionSummary objects.

          (structure)
              Details  about a package version, including its status, version,
              and revision. The ListPackageVersions operation returns  a  list
              of PackageVersionSummary objects.

              version -> (string)
                 Information about a package version.

              revision -> (string)
                 The revision associated with a package version.

              status -> (string)
                 A  string that contains the status of the package version. It
                 can be one of the following:

              origin -> (structure)
                 A PackageVersionOrigin object that contains information about
                 how the package version was added to the repository.

                 domainEntryPoint -> (structure)
                     A DomainEntryPoint object that contains information about
                     from which repository or external connection the  package
                     version was added to the domain.

                     repositoryName -> (string)
                        The  name  of the repository that a package was origi-
                        nally published to.

                     externalConnectionName -> (string)
                        The name of the external connection that a package was
                        ingested from.

                 originType -> (string)
                     Describes how the package version was originally added to
                     the domain. An INTERNAL origin  type  means  the  package
                     version was published directly to a repository in the do-
                     main. An EXTERNAL origin type means the  package  version
                     was ingested from an external connection.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  there are additional results, this is the token for the next set
          of results.
