LIST-PACKAGES()                                                LIST-PACKAGES()



NAME
       list-packages -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of PackageSummary objects for packages in a repository
       that match the request parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-packages is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: packages

SYNOPSIS
            list-packages
          --domain <value>
          [--domain-owner <value>]
          --repository <value>
          [--format <value>]
          [--namespace <value>]
          [--package-prefix <value>]
          [--publish <value>]
          [--upstream <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The  name  of  the domain that contains the repository that contains
          the requested packages.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the Amazon Web Services account  that
          owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          The name of the repository that contains the requested packages.

       --format (string)
          The format used to filter requested packages. Only packages from the
          provided format will be returned.

          Possible values:

          o npm

          o pypi

          o maven

          o nuget

       --namespace (string)
          The namespace used to filter requested packages. Only packages  with
          the  provided namespace will be returned. The package component that
          specifies its namespace depends on its type. For example:

          o The namespace of a Maven package is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm package is its scope .

          o Python and NuGet packages do not contain  a  corresponding  compo-
            nent, packages of those formats do not have a namespace.

       --package-prefix (string)
          A prefix used to filter requested packages. Only packages with names
          that start with packagePrefix are returned.

       --publish (string)
          The value of the Publish package origin control restriction used  to
          filter  requested packages. Only packages with the provided restric-
          tion     are     returned.     For     more     information,     see
          PackageOriginRestrictions .

          Possible values:

          o ALLOW

          o BLOCK

       --upstream (string)
          The value of the Upstream package origin control restriction used to
          filter requested packages. Only packages with the provided  restric-
          tion     are     returned.     For     more     information,     see
          PackageOriginRestrictions .

          Possible values:

          o ALLOW

          o BLOCK

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list packages in a repository

       The following list-packages example list packages in a repository named
       test-repo in a domain named test-domain.

          aws codeartifact list-packages \
              --domain test-domain \
              --repository test-repo

       Output:

          {
              "packages": [
                  {
                      "format": "npm",
                      "package": "lodash"
                  }
                  {
                      "format": "python",
                      "package": "test-package"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       packages -> (list)
          The list of returned PackageSummary objects.

          (structure)
              Details about a package, including its  format,  namespace,  and
              name.  The  ListPackages operation returns a list of PackageSum-
              mary objects.

              format -> (string)
                 The format of the package.

              namespace -> (string)
                 The namespace of the  package.  The  package  component  that
                 specifies its namespace depends on its type. For example:

                 o The namespace of a Maven package is its groupId .

                 o The namespace of an npm package is its scope .

                 o Python  and  NuGet  packages do not contain a corresponding
                   component, packages of those formats do not  have  a  name-
                   space.

              package -> (string)
                 The name of the package.

              originConfiguration -> (structure)
                 A   PackageOriginConfiguration   object   that   contains   a
                 PackageOriginRestrictions object  that  contains  information
                 about the upstream and publish package origin restrictions.

                 restrictions -> (structure)
                     A PackageOriginRestrictions object that contains informa-
                     tion about the upstream and publish package  origin  con-
                     figuration for the package.

                     publish -> (string)
                        The  package  origin  configuration that determines if
                        new versions of the package can be published  directly
                        to the repository.

                     upstream -> (string)
                        The  package  origin  configuration that determines if
                        new versions of the package can be added to the repos-
                        itory from an external connection or upstream source.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  there are additional results, this is the token for the next set
          of results.
