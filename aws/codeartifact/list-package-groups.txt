LIST-PACKAGE-GROUPS()                                    LIST-PACKAGE-GROUPS()



NAME
       list-package-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of package groups in the requested domain.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-package-groups is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: packageGroups

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The domain for which you want to list package groups.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the Amazon Web Services account  that
          owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --prefix (string)
          A  prefix  for  which to search package groups. When included, List-
          PackageGroups will return only package  groups  with  patterns  that
          match the prefix.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                            The package group origin restriction  setting.  If
                            the value of mode is ALLOW , ALLOW_SPECIFIC_REPOS-
                            ITORIES , or BLOCK , then the value of  effective-
                            Mode is the same. Otherwise, when the value is IN-
                            HERIT , then the value  of  effectiveMode  is  the
                            value of mode of the first parent group which does
                            not have a value of INHERIT .

                        effectiveMode -> (string)

                            LOW_SPECIFIC_REPOSITORIES , or BLOCK  ,  then  the
                            value  of  effectiveMode  is  the same. Otherwise,
                            when the value of mode is INHERIT , then the value
                            of effectiveMode is the value of mode of the first
                            parent group which does not have a  value  of  IN-
                            HERIT .

                        inheritedFrom -> (structure)
                            The  parent  package  group that the package group
                            origin restrictions are inherited from.

                            arn -> (string)

                               The pattern of the package group.  The  pattern
                               determines  which  packages are associated with
                               the package group, and is also  the  identifier
                               of the package group.

                        repositoriesCount -> (long)
                            The  number of repositories in the allowed reposi-
                            tory list.

              parent -> (structure)
                 The direct parent package group of the package group.

                 arn -> (string)

                 pattern -> (string)
                     The pattern of the package group. The pattern  determines
                     which packages are associated with the package group, and
                     is also the identifier of the package group.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
          previous  response  in  the next request to retrieve the next set of
          results.
