OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain that contains the  repository  that  contains
          the package version.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The  12-digit account number of the Amazon Web Services account that
          owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          The name of the repository that contains the package version.

       --format (string)
          A format that specifies the type of the requested package version.

          Possible values:

          o npm

          o pypi

          o maven

          o nuget

          o generic

          o ruby

          o swift

          o cargo

       --namespace (string)
          The namespace of the requested package version. The  package  compo-
          nent that specifies its namespace depends on its type. For example:

          NOTE:
              The  namespace  is  required when requesting package versions of
              the following formats:

              o Maven

              o Swift

              o generic

          o The namespace of a Maven package version is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm or Swift package version is its scope .

          o The namespace of a generic package is its namespace .

          o Python, NuGet, Ruby, and Cargo package versions do not  contain  a
            corresponding  component, package versions of those formats do not
            have a namespace.

       --package (string)
          The name of the requested package version.

       --package-version (string)
          A string that contains the package version (for example, 3.5.2 ).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       rides config/env settings.

                 origin type means the package version was  ingested  from  an
                 external connection.
