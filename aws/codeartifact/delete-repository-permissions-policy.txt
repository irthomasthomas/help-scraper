DELETE-REPOSITORY-PERMISSIONS-POLICY()  DELETE-REPOSITORY-PERMISSIONS-POLICY()



NAME
       delete-repository-permissions-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  resource  policy that is set on a repository. After a re-
       source policy is deleted, the permissions allowed  and  denied  by  the
       deleted  policy  are  removed. The effect of deleting a resource policy
       might not be immediate.

       WARNING:
          Use DeleteRepositoryPermissionsPolicy with caution. After  a  policy
          is deleted, Amazon Web Services users, roles, and accounts lose per-
          missions to perform the repository actions granted  by  the  deleted
          policy.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-repository-permissions-policy
          --domain <value>
          [--domain-owner <value>]
          --repository <value>
          [--policy-revision <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The  name of the domain that contains the repository associated with
          the resource policy to be deleted.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the Amazon Web Services account  that
          owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          The name of the repository that is associated with the resource pol-
          icy to be deleted

       --policy-revision (string)
          The revision of the repository's resource policy to be deleted. This
          revision  is used for optimistic locking, which prevents others from
          accidentally overwriting your changes to the  repository's  resource
          policy.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
