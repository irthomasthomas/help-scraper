PUT-REPOSITORY-PERMISSIONS-POLICY()        PUT-REPOSITORY-PERMISSIONS-POLICY()



NAME
       put-repository-permissions-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  the resource policy on a repository that specifies permissions to
       access it.

       When you call PutRepositoryPermissionsPolicy , the resource  policy  on
       the repository is ignored when evaluting permissions. This ensures that
       the owner of a repository cannot lock themselves out of the repository,
       which would prevent them from being able to update the resource policy.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-repository-permissions-policy
          --domain <value>
          [--domain-owner <value>]
          --repository <value>
          [--policy-revision <value>]
          --policy-document <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain containing the repository to set the resource
          policy on.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the Amazon Web Services account  that
          owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          The name of the repository to set the resource policy on.

       --policy-revision (string)
          Sets  the revision of the resource policy that specifies permissions
          to access the repository. This revision is used for optimistic lock-
          ing,  which  prevents  others  from  overwriting your changes to the
          repository's resource policy.

       --policy-document (string)
          A valid displayable JSON Aspen policy string to be set as the access
          control resource policy on the provided repository.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To attach a permissions policy to a repository

       The following put-repository-permissions-policy example attaches a per-
       mission policy that is defined in the policy.json file to a  repository
       named test-repo.

          aws codeartifact put-repository-permissions-policy \
              --domain test-domain \
              --repository test-repo \
              --policy-document file://PATH/TO/policy.json

       Output:

          {
              "policy": {
                  "resourceArn": "arn:aws:codeartifact:region-id:111122223333:repository/test-domain/test-repo",
                  "document": "{ ...policy document content...}",
                  "revision": "MQlyyTQRASRU3HB58gBtSDHXG7Q3hvxxxxxxx="
              }
          }

       For  more  information,  see  Set a policy in the AWS CodeArtifact User
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       policy -> (structure)
          The resource policy that was set after processing the request.

          resourceArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the resource associated with the resource policy

          revision -> (string)
              The current revision of the resource policy.
