GET-DOMAIN-PERMISSIONS-POLICY()                GET-DOMAIN-PERMISSIONS-POLICY()



NAME
       get-domain-permissions-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the resource policy attached to the specified domain.

       NOTE:
          The policy is a resource-based policy, not an identity-based policy.
          For more information, see Identity-based policies and resource-based
          policies in the IAM User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-domain-permissions-policy
          --domain <value>
          [--domain-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain to which the resource policy is attached.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The  12-digit account number of the Amazon Web Services account that
          owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
