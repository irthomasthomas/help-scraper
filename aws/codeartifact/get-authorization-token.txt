GET-AUTHORIZATION-TOKEN()                            GET-AUTHORIZATION-TOKEN()



NAME
       get-authorization-token -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates a temporary authorization token for accessing repositories in
       the domain. This API  requires  the  codeartifact:GetAuthorizationToken
       and  sts:GetServiceBearerToken  permissions. For more information about
       authorization tokens, see CodeArtifact authentication and tokens .

       NOTE:
          CodeArtifact authorization tokens are valid for a period of 12 hours
          when created with the login command. You can call login periodically
          to refresh the token. When you create an  authorization  token  with
          the  GetAuthorizationToken  API,  you can set a custom authorization
          period, up to a maximum of 12 hours, with the durationSeconds param-
          eter.

          The authorization period begins after login or GetAuthorizationToken
          is called. If login or GetAuthorizationToken is called while  assum-
          ing a role, the token lifetime is independent of the maximum session
          duration of the role. For example, if you call sts  assume-role  and
          specify  a session duration of 15 minutes, then generate a CodeArti-
          fact authorization token, the token will be valid for the  full  au-
          thorization  period  even  though  this is longer than the 15-minute
          session duration.

          See Using IAM Roles for more information on controlling session  du-
          ration.

SYNOPSIS
            get-authorization-token
          --domain <value>
          [--domain-owner <value>]
          [--duration-seconds <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain that is in scope for the generated authoriza-
          tion token.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the Amazon Web Services account  that
          owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --duration-seconds (long)
          The  time,  in  seconds,  that  the generated authorization token is
          valid. Valid values are 0 and any number between  900  (15  minutes)
          and  43200  (12  hours). A value of 0 will set the expiration of the
          authorization token to the same expiration of the user's role's tem-
          porary credentials.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get an authorization token

       The  following get-authorization-token example retrieves a CodeArtifact
       authorization token.

          aws codeartifact get-authorization-token \
              --domain test-domain \
              --query authorizationToken \
              --output text

       Output:

          This command will return the authorization token. You can store the output in an environment variable when calling the command.

       For more information, see Configure pip without the  login  command  in
       the AWS CodeArtifact User Guide.

OUTPUT
       authorizationToken -> (string)
          The returned authentication token.

       expiration -> (timestamp)
          A timestamp that specifies the date and time the authorization token
          expires.
