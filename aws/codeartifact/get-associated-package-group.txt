GET-ASSOCIATED-PACKAGE-GROUP()                  GET-ASSOCIATED-PACKAGE-GROUP()



NAME
       get-associated-package-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  most  closely  associated  package group to the specified
       package. This API does not require that the package exist in any repos-
       itory  in the domain. As such, GetAssociatedPackageGroup can be used to
       see which package group's origin configuration applies to a package be-
       fore  that  package is in a repository. This can be helpful to check if
       public packages are blocked without ingesting them.

       For information package group association  and  matching,  see  Package
       group  definition syntax and matching behavior in the CodeArtifact User
       Guide .

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain that contains the package from which  to  get
          the associated package group.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The  12-digit account number of the Amazon Web Services account that
          owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --format (string)
          The format of the package from which to get the  associated  package
          group.

          Possible values:

          o npm

          o pypi

          o maven

          o nuget

          o generic

          o swift

       --namespace (string)
          The  namespace of the package from which to get the associated pack-
          age group. The package component that specifies  its  namespace  de-
          pends on its type. For example:

          NOTE:
              The namespace is required when getting associated package groups
              from packages of the following formats:

              o Maven

              o Swift

              o generic

          o The namespace of a Maven package version is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm or Swift package version is its scope .

          o The namespace of a generic package is its namespace .

          o Python and NuGet package versions do not contain  a  corresponding
            component,  package  versions of those formats do not have a name-
            space.

       --package (string)
          The package from which to get the associated package group.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                     mode -> (string)
                        The  package  group origin restriction setting. If the

                        the value of mode of the first parent group which does
                        not have a value of INHERIT .

                     inheritedFrom -> (structure)
                        The parent package group that the package group origin

                        pattern -> (string)
                            The pattern of the package group. The pattern  de-

              pattern -> (string)
                 The pattern of the  package  group.  The  pattern  determines

       associationType -> (string)
          Describes the strength of the association between  the  package  and
          package group. A strong match is also known as an exact match, and a
