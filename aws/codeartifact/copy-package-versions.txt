SYNOPSIS
            copy-package-versions
          --domain <value>
          [--domain-owner <value>]
          --source-repository <value>
          --destination-repository <value>
          --format <value>
          [--namespace <value>]
          --package <value>
          [--versions <value>]
          [--version-revisions <value>]
          [--allow-overwrite | --no-allow-overwrite]
          [--include-from-upstream | --no-include-from-upstream]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The  name  of  the  domain  that contains the source and destination
          repositories.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the Amazon Web Services account  that
          owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --source-repository (string)
          The  name of the repository that contains the package versions to be
          copied.

       --destination-repository (string)
          The name of the repository into which package versions are copied.

       --format (string)
          The format of the package versions to be copied.

          Possible values:

          o npm

          o pypi

          o maven

          o nuget

       --namespace (string)
          The namespace of the package versions to be copied. The package ver-
          sion component that specifies its namespace depends on its type. For
          example:

          o The namespace of a Maven package version  is  its  groupId  .  The
            namespace is required when copying Maven package versions.

          o The namespace of an npm package version is its scope .

          o Python  and  NuGet package versions do not contain a corresponding
            component, package versions of those formats do not have  a  name-
            space.

       --package (string)
          The name of the package that contains the versions to be copied.

       --versions (list)
          The versions of the package to be copied.

          NOTE:
              You must specify versions or versionRevisions . You cannot spec-
              ify both.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --version-revisions (map)
          A list of key-value pairs. The keys are  package  versions  and  the
          values are package version revisions. A CopyPackageVersion operation
          succeeds if the specified versions in the  source  repository  match
          the specified package version revision.

          NOTE:
              You must specify versions or versionRevisions . You cannot spec-
              ify both.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --allow-overwrite | --no-allow-overwrite (boolean)
          Set to true to overwrite a package version that  already  exists  in
          the  destination repository. If set to false and the package version
          already exists in the destination repository, the package version is
          returned  in  the  failedVersions  field of the response with an AL-
          READY_EXISTS error code.

       --include-from-upstream | --no-include-from-upstream (boolean)
          Set to true to copy packages from  repositories  that  are  upstream
          from  the  source  repository to the destination repository. The de-
          fault setting is false. For more information, see Working  with  up-
          stream repositories .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To copy package versions from one repository to another

       The following copy-package-versions moves versions 4.0.0 and 5.0.0 of a
       package named test-package from my-repo to test-repo.

          aws codeartifact copy-package-versions \
              --domain test-domain \
              --source-repository my-repo \
              --destination-repository test-repo \
              --format npm \
              --package test-package \
              --versions '["4.0.0", "5.0.0"]'

       Output:

          {
              "format": "npm",
              "package": "test-package",
              "versions": [
                  {
                  "version": "5.0.0",
                  "revision": "REVISION-1-SAMPLE-6C81EFF7DA55CC",
                  "status": "Published"
                  },
                  {
                  "version": "4.0.0",
                  "revision": "REVISION-2-SAMPLE-55C752BEE772FC",
                  "status": "Published"
                  }
              ]
          }
