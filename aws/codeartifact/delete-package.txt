OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain that contains the package to delete.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The  12-digit account number of the Amazon Web Services account that
          owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          The name of the repository that contains the package to delete.

       --format (string)
          The format of the requested package to delete.

          Possible values:

          o npm

          o pypi

          o maven

          o nuget

          o generic

          o ruby

          o swift

          o cargo

       --namespace (string)
          The namespace of the package to delete. The package  component  that
          specifies its namespace depends on its type. For example:

          NOTE:
              The  namespace is required when deleting packages of the follow-
              ing formats:

              o Maven

              o Swift

              o generic

          o The namespace of a Maven package version is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm or Swift package version is its scope .

          o The namespace of a generic package is its namespace .

          o Python, NuGet, Ruby, and Cargo package versions do not  contain  a
            corresponding  component, package versions of those formats do not
            have a namespace.

       --package (string)
          The name of the package to delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

                 publish -> (string)
                     The  package  origin configuration that determines if new

                 upstream -> (string)
                     The  package  origin configuration that determines if new
