NAME
       put-package-origin-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets the package origin configuration for a package.

       The package origin configuration determines how new versions of a pack-
       age can be added to a repository. You can allow or  block  direct  pub-
       lishing  of  new  package  versions,  or ingestion and retaining of new
       package versions from an external connection or  upstream  source.  For
       more  information  about package origin controls and configuration, see
       Editing package origin controls in the CodeArtifact User Guide .
          PutPackageOriginConfiguration  can  be  called  on  a  package  that
          doesn't  yet  exist in the repository. When called on a package that
          does not exist, a package is created in the repository with no  ver-
          sions  and  the  requested restrictions are set on the package. This
          can be used to preemptively block ingesting or  retaining  any  ver-
          sions  from  external  connections  or  upstream repositories, or to
          block publishing any versions of the package into the repository be-
          fore  connecting  any  package managers or publishers to the reposi-
          tory.

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain that contains the  repository  that  contains
          the package.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The  12-digit account number of the Amazon Web Services account that
          owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          The name of the repository that contains the package.

       --format (string)
          A format that specifies the type of the package to be updated.

          Possible values:

          o npm

          o pypi

          o maven

          o nuget

          o generic

          o ruby

          o swift

          o cargo

       --namespace (string)
          The namespace of the package to be updated.  The  package  component
          that specifies its namespace depends on its type. For example:

          o The namespace of a Maven package version is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm or Swift package version is its scope .

          o The namespace of a generic package is its namespace .

          o Python,  NuGet,  Ruby, and Cargo package versions do not contain a
            corresponding component, package versions of those formats do  not
            have a namespace.

       --package (string)
          The name of the package to be updated.

       --restrictions (structure)
          A  PackageOriginRestrictions  object that contains information about
          the upstream and publish package origin restrictions.  The  upstream
          restriction  determines  if  new package versions can be ingested or
          retained from external connections  or  upstream  repositories.  The
          publish  restriction  determines if new package versions can be pub-
          lished directly to the repository.

          You must include both the desired upstream and publish restrictions.

          publish -> (string)
              The package origin configuration that determines if new versions
              of the package can be published directly to the repository.

          upstream -> (string)
              The package origin configuration that determines if new versions
              of the package can be added to the repository from  an  external
              connection or upstream source.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          publish=string,upstream=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "publish": "ALLOW"|"BLOCK",
            "upstream": "ALLOW"|"BLOCK"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

          PackageOriginRestrictions  object that describes how new versions of
          the package can be introduced to the repository.

          restrictions -> (structure)
              A PackageOriginRestrictions  object  that  contains  information

              upstream -> (string)
                 The package origin configuration that determines if new  ver-
