CREATE-DOMAIN()                                                CREATE-DOMAIN()



NAME
       create-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a domain. CodeArtifact domains make it easier to manage multi-
       ple repositories across an organization. You can use a domain to  apply
       permissions across many repositories owned by different Amazon Web Ser-
       vices accounts. An asset is stored only once in a domain, even if  it's
       in multiple repositories.

       Although  you  can have multiple domains, we recommend a single produc-
       tion domain that contains all published artifacts so that your develop-
       ment  teams  can find and share packages. You can use a second pre-pro-
       duction domain to test changes to the production domain configuration.

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain to create. All domain names in an Amazon  Web
          Services  Region  that  are  in the same Amazon Web Services account
          must be unique. The domain name is used as the prefix in  DNS  host-
          names.  Do not use sensitive information in a domain name because it
          is publicly discoverable.

       --encryption-key (string)
          The encryption key for the domain. This is used to  encrypt  content
          stored  in a domain. An encryption key can be a key ID, a key Amazon
          Resource Name (ARN), a key alias, or a key alias ARN. To specify  an
          encryptionKey , your IAM role must have kms:DescribeKey and kms:Cre-
          ateGrant permissions on the encryption key that is  used.  For  more
          information,  see DescribeKey in the Key Management Service API Ref-
          erence and Key Management Service API Permissions Reference  in  the
          Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          WARNING:
              CodeArtifact  supports  only symmetric CMKs. Do not associate an
              asymmetric CMK with your domain. For more information, see Using
              symmetric  and asymmetric keys in the Key Management Service De-
              veloper Guide .

       --tags (list)
          One or more tag key-value pairs for the domain.

          (structure)
              A tag is a key-value pair that can be  used  to  manage,  search
              for, or filter resources in CodeArtifact.

              key -> (string)
                 The tag key.

              value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a domain

       The following create-domain example creates a domain named test-domain.

          aws codeartifact create-domain \
              --domain test-domain

       Output:

          {
              "domain": {
                  "name": "test-domain",
                  "owner": "111122223333",
                  "arn": "arn:aws:codeartifact:us-west-2:111122223333:domain/test-domain",
