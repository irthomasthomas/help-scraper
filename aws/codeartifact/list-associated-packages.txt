LIST-ASSOCIATED-PACKAGES()                          LIST-ASSOCIATED-PACKAGES()



NAME
       list-associated-packages -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of packages associated with the requested package group.
       For information package group association  and  matching,  see  Package
       group  definition syntax and matching behavior in the CodeArtifact User
       Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-associated-packages is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: packages

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain that contains the package group from which to
          list associated packages.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the Amazon Web Services account  that
          owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --package-group (string)
          The pattern of the package group from which to list associated pack-
          ages.

       --preview | --no-preview (boolean)
          When this flag is included,  ListAssociatedPackages  will  return  a
          list of packages that would be associated with a package group, even
          if it does not exist.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       packages -> (list)
          The list of packages associated with the requested package group.

          (structure)
              A package associated with a package group.

              format -> (string)
                 A format that specifies the type of the associated package.

              namespace -> (string)
                 The namespace of the associated package. The  package  compo-
                 nent  that  specifies  its namespace depends on its type. For
                 example:

                 o The namespace of a Maven package version is its groupId .

                 o The namespace of an npm or Swift  package  version  is  its
                   scope .

                 o The namespace of a generic package is its namespace .

                 o Python,  NuGet,  and Ruby package versions do not contain a
                   corresponding component, package versions of those  formats
                   do not have a namespace.

              package -> (string)
                 The name of the associated package.

              associationType -> (string)
                 Describes the strength of the association between the package
                 and package group. A strong match can be thought of as an ex-
                 act  match, and a weak match can be thought of as a variation
                 match, for example, the package name matches a  variation  of
                 the package group pattern. For more information about package
                 group pattern matching, including strong  and  weak  matches,
                 see  Package group definition syntax and matching behavior in
                 the CodeArtifact User Guide .

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
          previous  response  in  the next request to retrieve the next set of
          results.
