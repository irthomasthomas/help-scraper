NAME
       list-package-version-dependencies -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the direct dependencies for a package version. The dependencies
       are returned as PackageDependency objects.  CodeArtifact  extracts  the
       dependencies for a package version from the metadata file for the pack-
       age format (for example, the package.json file for npm packages and the
       pom.xml  file for Maven). Any package version dependencies that are not
       listed in the configuration file are not returned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-package-version-dependencies
          --domain <value>
          [--domain-owner <value>]
          --repository <value>
          --format <value>
          [--namespace <value>]
          --package <value>
          --package-version <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain that contains the  repository  that  contains
          the requested package version dependencies.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The  12-digit account number of the Amazon Web Services account that
          owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          The name of the repository that contains the requested package  ver-
          sion.

       --format (string)
          The format of the package with the requested dependencies.

          Possible values:

          o npm

          o pypi

          o maven

          o nuget

       --namespace (string)
          The  namespace  of  the package version with the requested dependen-
          cies. The package version component that specifies its namespace de-
          pends on its type. For example:

          o The namespace of a Maven package version is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm package version is its scope .

          o Python  and  NuGet package versions do not contain a corresponding
            component, package versions of those formats do not have  a  name-
            space.

       --package (string)
          The name of the package versions' package.

       --package-version (string)
          A string that contains the package version (for example, 3.5.2 ).

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
          previous response in the next request to retrieve the  next  set  of
          results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view a package version's dependencies

       The  following  list-package-version-dependencies example retrieves the
       dependencies for version 4.0.0 of an npm package named test-package.

          aws codeartifact list-package-version-dependencies \
              --domain test-domain \
              --repo test-repo \
              --format npm \
              --package test-package \
              --package-version 4.0.0

       Output:

          {
              "format": "npm",
              "package": "test-package",
              "version": "4.0.0",
              "versionRevision": "Ciqe5/9yicvkJT13b5/LdLpCyE6fqA7poa9qp+FilPs=",
              "dependencies": [
                  {
                      "namespace": "testns",
                      "package": "testdep1",
                      "dependencyType": "regular",
                      "versionRequirement": "1.8.5"
                  },
                  {
                      "namespace": "testns",
                      "package": "testdep2",
                      "dependencyType": "regular",
                      "versionRequirement": "1.8.5"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       format -> (string)
          A  format  that  specifies the type of the package that contains the
          returned dependencies.

       namespace -> (string)
          The namespace of the package version that contains the returned  de-
          pendencies.  The  package version component that specifies its name-
          space depends on its type. For example:

          o The namespace of a Maven package version is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm package version is its scope .

          o Python and NuGet package versions do not contain  a  corresponding
            component,  package  versions of those formats do not have a name-
            space.

       package -> (string)
          The name of the package that contains the returned package  versions
          dependencies.

       version -> (string)
          The version of the package that is specified in the request.

       versionRevision -> (string)
          The current revision associated with the package version.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
          previous response in the next request to retrieve the  next  set  of
          results.

       dependencies -> (list)
          The returned list of PackageDependency objects.

          (structure)
              Details about a package dependency.

              namespace -> (string)
                 The  namespace  of  the package that this package depends on.
                 The package component that specifies its namespace depends on
                 its type. For example:

                 o The namespace of a Maven package is its groupId .

                 o The namespace of an npm package is its scope .

                 o Python  and  NuGet  packages do not contain a corresponding
                   component, packages of those formats do not  have  a  name-
                   space.

              package -> (string)
                 The name of the package that this package depends on.

              dependencyType -> (string)
                 The  type of a package dependency. The possible values depend
                 on the package type. Example types are compile  ,  runtime  ,
                 and  test  for  Maven packages, and dev , prod , and optional
                 for npm packages.

              versionRequirement -> (string)
                 The required version, or version range, of the  package  that
                 this  package  depends  on. The version format is specific to
                 the package type. For example,  the  following  are  possible
                 valid required versions: 1.2.3 , ^2.3.4 , or 4.x .
