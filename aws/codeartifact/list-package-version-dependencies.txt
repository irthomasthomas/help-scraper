LIST-PACKAGE-VERSION-DEPENDENCIES()        LIST-PACKAGE-VERSION-DEPENDENCIES()



NAME
       list-package-version-dependencies -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the direct dependencies for a package version. The dependencies
       are returned as PackageDependency objects.  CodeArtifact  extracts  the
       dependencies for a package version from the metadata file for the pack-
       age format (for example, the package.json file for npm packages and the
       pom.xml  file for Maven). Any package version dependencies that are not
       listed in the configuration file are not returned.

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain that contains the  repository  that  contains
          the requested package version dependencies.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The  12-digit account number of the Amazon Web Services account that
          owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          The name of the repository that contains the requested package  ver-
          sion.

       --format (string)
          The format of the package with the requested dependencies.

          Possible values:

          o npm

          o pypi

          o maven

          o nuget

          o generic

          o ruby

          o swift

          o cargo

       --namespace (string)
          The  namespace  of  the package version with the requested dependen-
          cies. The package component that specifies its namespace depends  on
          its type. For example:

          NOTE:
              The namespace is required when listing dependencies from package
              versions of the following formats:

              o Maven

          o The namespace of a Maven package version is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm package version is its scope .

          o Python and NuGet package versions do not contain  a  corresponding
            component,  package  versions of those formats do not have a name-
            space.

       --package (string)
          The name of the package versions' package.

       --package-version (string)
          A string that contains the package version (for example, 3.5.2 ).

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
          previous  response  in  the next request to retrieve the next set of
          results.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view a package version's dependencies

       The following list-package-version-dependencies example  retrieves  the
       dependencies for version 4.0.0 of an npm package named test-package.

          aws codeartifact list-package-version-dependencies \
              --domain test-domain \
              --repo test-repo \
              --format npm \
              --package test-package \
              --package-version 4.0.0

       Output:

OUTPUT
       format -> (string)
          A format that specifies the type of the package  that  contains  the
          returned dependencies.

       namespace -> (string)
          The  namespace of the package version that contains the returned de-
          pendencies. The package component that specifies its  namespace  de-
          pends on its type. For example:

          NOTE:
              The namespace is required when listing dependencies from package
              versions of the following formats:

              o Maven

          o The namespace of a Maven package version is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm package version is its scope .

          o Python and NuGet package versions do not contain  a  corresponding
            component,  package  versions of those formats do not have a name-
            space.

       package -> (string)
          The name of the package that contains the returned package  versions
          dependencies.

       version -> (string)
          The version of the package that is specified in the request.

       versionRevision -> (string)
          The current revision associated with the package version.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
          previous response in the next request to retrieve the  next  set  of
          results.

       dependencies -> (list)
          The returned list of PackageDependency objects.

          (structure)
              Details about a package dependency.

              namespace -> (string)
                 The  namespace  of  the package that this package depends on.
                 The package component that specifies its namespace depends on
                 its type. For example:

                 o The namespace of a Maven package version is its groupId .

                 o The  namespace  of  an  npm or Swift package version is its
                   scope .

                 o The namespace of a generic package is its namespace .

                 o Python, NuGet, Ruby, and Cargo package versions do not con-
                   tain  a  corresponding component, package versions of those
                   formats do not have a namespace.

              package -> (string)
                 The name of the package that this package depends on.

              dependencyType -> (string)
                 The type of a package dependency. The possible values  depend
                 on the package type.

                 o npm: regular , dev , peer , optional

                 o maven:  optional , parent , compile , runtime , test , sys-
                   tem , provided .

                 NOTE:
                     Note that parent is not a regular Maven dependency  type;
                     instead  this  is  extracted from the <parent> element if
                     one is defined in the package version's POM file.

                 o nuget: The dependencyType field  is  never  set  for  NuGet
                   packages.

                 o pypi: Requires-Dist

              versionRequirement -> (string)
                 The  required  version, or version range, of the package that
                 this package depends on. The version format  is  specific  to
                 the  package  type.  For  example, the following are possible
                 valid required versions: 1.2.3 , ^2.3.4 , or 4.x .
