DISPOSE-PACKAGE-VERSIONS()                          DISPOSE-PACKAGE-VERSIONS()



NAME
       dispose-package-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  assets in package versions and sets the package versions'
       status to Disposed . A disposed package version cannot be  restored  in
       your repository because its assets are deleted.

       To   view   all   disposed   package  versions  in  a  repository,  use
       ListPackageVersions and set the status parameter to Disposed .

       To  view  information   about   a   disposed   package   version,   use
       DescribePackageVersion .

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)

          owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          The  name  of  the repository that contains the package versions you
          want to dispose.

       --format (string)
          A format that specifies the type of package  versions  you  want  to
          dispose.

          Possible values:

          o swift

          o cargo

       --namespace (string)
          The  namespace  of  the package versions to be disposed. The package
          component that specifies its namespace depends on its type. For  ex-
          ample:

          NOTE:
              The namespace is required when disposing package versions of the
              following formats:

              o Maven

              o Swift

              o generic

          o The namespace of a Maven package version is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm or Swift package version is its scope .

          o The namespace of a generic package is its namespace .

          o Python, NuGet, Ruby, and Cargo package versions do not  contain  a
            corresponding  component, package versions of those formats do not
            have a namespace.

       --package (string)
          The name of the package with the versions you want to dispose.

       --versions (list)
          The versions of the package you want to dispose.

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --version-revisions (map)
          The revisions of the package versions you want to dispose.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --expected-status (string)
          The expected status of the package version to dispose.

          o Deleted

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete a package version's assets and set its status to Disposed

       The following dispose-package-versions example deletes  the  assets  of
       test-package version 4.0.0 and sets its status to Disposed.

          aws codeartifact dispose-package-versions \
              --domain test-domain \
              --repo test-repo \
              --format npm \
              --package test-package \
              --versions 4.0.0

       Output:

          {
              "successfulVersions": {
                  "4.0.0": {
                      "revision": "Ciqe5/9yicvkJT13b5/LdLpCyE6fqA7poa9qp+FilPs=",
                      "status": "Disposed"
                  }
              },
              "failedVersions": {}
          }

       AWS CodeArtifact User Guide.
