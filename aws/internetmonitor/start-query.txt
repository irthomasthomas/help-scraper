START-QUERY()                                                    START-QUERY()



NAME
       start-query -

DESCRIPTION
       Start  a  query to return data for a specific query type for the Amazon
       CloudWatch Internet Monitor query interface. Specify a time period  for
       the  data  that  you want returned by using StartTime and EndTime . You
       filter the query results to return by  providing  parameters  that  you
       specify with FilterParameters .

       For  more  information about using the query interface, including exam-
       ples, see Using the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor query  interface
       in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor User Guide.

OPTIONS
       --monitor-name (string)
          The name of the monitor to query.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The  timestamp  that is the beginning of the period that you want to
          retrieve data for with your query.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The timestamp that is the end of the period that  you  want  to  re-
          trieve data for with your query.

       --query-type (string)
          The  type  of  query  to  run.  The following are the three types of
          queries that you can run using the Internet Monitor query interface:

          o MEASUREMENTS : Provides availability score, performance score, to-
            tal traffic, and round-trip times, at 5 minute intervals.

          o TOP_LOCATIONS  :  Provides  availability score, performance score,
            total traffic, and time to first byte (TTFB) information, for  the
            top location and ASN combinations that you're monitoring, by traf-
            fic volume.

          o TOP_LOCATION_DETAILS : Provides TTFB for Amazon  CloudFront,  your
            current  configuration, and the best performing EC2 configuration,
            at 1 hour intervals.

          For lists of the fields returned with each query type and  more  in-
          formation  about  how each type of query is performed, see Using the
          Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor query  interface  in  the  Amazon
          CloudWatch Internet Monitor User Guide.

          Possible values:

          o MEASUREMENTS

          o TOP_LOCATIONS

          o TOP_LOCATION_DETAILS

       --filter-parameters (list)
          The  FilterParameters  field that you use with Amazon CloudWatch In-
          ternet Monitor queries is a string the defines how you want a  query
          to be filtered. The filter parameters that you can specify depend on
          the query type, since each query type returns a different set of In-
          ternet Monitor data.

          For  more  information about specifying filter parameters, see Using
          the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor query interface in the Amazon
          CloudWatch Internet Monitor User Guide.

          (structure)
              A  filter  that  you use with the results of a Amazon CloudWatch
              Internet Monitor query that you created and ran. The query  sets
              up  a  repository of data that is a subset of your application's
              Internet Monitor data. FilterParameter is a string that  defines
              how you want to filter the repository of data to return a set of
              results, based on your criteria.

              The filter parameters that you can specify depend on  the  query
              type  that  you  used to create the repository, since each query
              type returns a different set of Internet Monitor data.

              For each filter, you specify a field (such as city ), an  opera-
              tor  (such  as not_equals , and a value or array of values (such
              as ["Seattle", "Redmond"] ). Separate values in the  array  with
              commas.

              For  more  information  about  specifying filter parameters, see
              Using the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor query interface  in
              the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor User Guide.

              Field -> (string)
                 A  data  field that you want to filter, to further scope your
                 application's Internet Monitor data in a repository that  you
                 created by running a query. A field might be city , for exam-
                 ple. The field must be one of the fields that was returned by
                 the specific query that you used to create the repository.

              Operator -> (string)
                 The  operator  to use with the filter field and a value, such
                 as not_equals .

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more values to be used, together  with  the  specified
                 operator,  to filter data for a query. For example, you could
                 specify an array of values such as ["Seattle",  "Redmond"]  .
                 Values in the array are separated by commas.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Field=string,Operator=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Field": "string",
              "Operator": "EQUALS"|"NOT_EQUALS",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
