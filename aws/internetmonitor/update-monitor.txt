UPDATE-MONITOR()                                              UPDATE-MONITOR()



NAME
       update-monitor -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates a monitor. You can update a monitor to change the percentage of
       traffic to monitor or the maximum number  of  city-networks  (locations
       and  ASNs),  to add or remove resources, or to change the status of the
       monitor. Note that you can't change the name of a monitor.

       The city-network maximum that you choose is the limit, but you only pay
       for  the  number of city-networks that are actually monitored. For more
       information, see Choosing a city-network maximum value  in  the  Amazon
       CloudWatch User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --monitor-name (string)
          The name of the monitor.

       --resources-to-add (list)
          The resources to include in a monitor, which you provide as a set of
          Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). Resources can be  VPCs,  NLBs,  Amazon
          CloudFront distributions, or Amazon WorkSpaces directories.

          You  can  add a combination of VPCs and CloudFront distributions, or
          you can add WorkSpaces directories, or you can add NLBs.  You  can't
          add  NLBs  or  WorkSpaces  directories  together  with any other re-
          sources.

          NOTE:
              If you add only Amazon  Virtual  Private  Clouds  resources,  at
              least  one  VPC must have an Internet Gateway attached to it, to
              make sure that it has internet connectivity.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --resources-to-remove (list)
          The resources to remove from a monitor, which you provide as  a  set
          of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --status (string)
          The  status  for  a monitor. The accepted values for Status with the
          UpdateMonitor API call are the following: ACTIVE and INACTIVE .  The
          following values are not accepted: PENDING , and ERROR .

          Possible values:

          o PENDING

          o ACTIVE

          o INACTIVE

          o ERROR

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive  string of up to 64 ASCII characters that
          you specify to make an idempotent API request. You should not  reuse
          the same client token for other API requests.

       --max-city-networks-to-monitor (integer)
          The maximum number of city-networks to monitor for your application.
          A city-network is the location (city) where clients access your  ap-
          plication resources from and the ASN or network provider, such as an
          internet service provider (ISP), that clients access  the  resources
          through. Setting this limit can help control billing costs.

       --internet-measurements-log-delivery (structure)
          Publish  internet measurements for Internet Monitor to another loca-
          tion, such as an Amazon S3 bucket. The measurements  are  also  pub-
          lished to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

          S3Config -> (structure)
              The  configuration  information  for publishing Internet Monitor
              internet measurements to Amazon S3. The  configuration  includes
              the  bucket  name  and  (optionally) prefix for the S3 bucket to
              store the measurements, and the delivery  status.  The  delivery
              status  is ENABLED or DISABLED , depending on whether you choose
              to deliver internet measurements to S3 logs.

              BucketName -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 bucket name.

              BucketPrefix -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 bucket prefix.

              LogDeliveryStatus -> (string)
                 The status of publishing Internet Monitor  internet  measure-
                 ments to an Amazon S3 bucket.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Config={BucketName=string,BucketPrefix=string,LogDeliveryStatus=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Config": {
              "BucketName": "string",
              "BucketPrefix": "string",
              "LogDeliveryStatus": "ENABLED"|"DISABLED"
            }
          }

       --traffic-percentage-to-monitor (integer)
          The  percentage  of the internet-facing traffic for your application
          that you want to monitor with this monitor. If you set  a  city-net-
          works  maximum, that limit overrides the traffic percentage that you
          set.

          To learn more, see Choosing an  application  traffic  percentage  to
          monitor  in  the  Amazon  CloudWatch Internet Monitor section of the

          health  scores,  along  with other configuration information, deter-
          mines when Internet Monitor creates a health event when  there's  an
          internet issue that affects your application end users.

          For  more information, see Change health event thresholds in the In-
          ternet Monitor section of the CloudWatch User Guide .

              The  health  event  threshold  percentage  set  for  performance
              scores.

          AvailabilityLocalHealthEventsConfig -> (structure)
              The configuration that determines the threshold and other condi-
              tions for when Internet Monitor creates a health event for a lo-
              cal availability issue.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of whether Internet Monitor creates a health event
                 based on a threshold percentage set for a local health score.
                 The status can be ENABLED or DISABLED .

              HealthScoreThreshold -> (double)
                 The health event threshold percentage set for a local  health
                 score.

              MinTrafficImpact -> (double)
                 The  minimum percentage of overall traffic for an application
                 that must be impacted by an  issue  before  Internet  Monitor
                 creates  an  event  when  a  threshold is crossed for a local
                 health score.

              The configuration that determines the threshold and other condi-
              tions for when Internet Monitor creates a health event for a lo-
              cal performance issue.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of whether Internet Monitor creates a health event
                 based on a threshold percentage set for a local health score.
                 The status can be ENABLED or DISABLED .

              HealthScoreThreshold -> (double)
                 The  health event threshold percentage set for a local health
                 score.

                 The minimum percentage of overall traffic for an  application
                 that  must  be  impacted  by an issue before Internet Monitor
                 creates an event when a threshold  is  crossed  for  a  local
                 health score.

                 If  you don't set a minimum traffic impact threshold, the de-
                 fault value is 0.1%.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AvailabilityScoreThreshold=double,PerformanceScoreThreshold=double,AvailabilityLocalHealthEventsConfig={Status=string,HealthScoreThreshold=double,MinTrafficImpact=double},PerformanceLocalHealthEventsConfig={Status=string,HealthScoreThreshold=double,MinTrafficImpact=double}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AvailabilityScoreThreshold": double,
            "PerformanceScoreThreshold": double,
            "AvailabilityLocalHealthEventsConfig": {

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
