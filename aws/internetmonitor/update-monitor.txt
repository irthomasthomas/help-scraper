UPDATE-MONITOR()                                              UPDATE-MONITOR()



NAME
       update-monitor -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  a monitor. You can update a monitor to change the maximum num-
       ber  of  city-networks  (locations  and  ASNs   or   internet   service
       providers),  to add or remove resources, or to change the status of the
       monitor. Note that you can't change the name of a monitor.

       The city-network maximum that you choose is the limit, but you only pay
       for  the  number of city-networks that are actually monitored. For more
       information, see Choosing a city-network maximum value  in  the  Amazon
       CloudWatch User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --monitor-name (string)
          The name of the monitor.

       --resources-to-add (list)
          The resources to include in a monitor, which you provide as a set of
          Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).

          You can add a combination of Amazon Virtual  Private  Clouds  (VPCs)
          and   Amazon   CloudFront  distributions,  or  you  can  add  Amazon
          WorkSpaces directories. You can't add all three types of resources.

          NOTE:
              If you add only VPC resources, at least one VPC must have an In-
              ternet Gateway attached to it, to make sure that it has internet
              connectivity.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --resources-to-remove (list)
          The resources to remove from a monitor, which you provide as  a  set
          of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --status (string)
          The  status  for  a monitor. The accepted values for Status with the
          UpdateMonitor API call are the following: ACTIVE and INACTIVE .  The
          following values are not accepted: PENDING , and ERROR .

          Possible values:

          o PENDING

          o ACTIVE

          o INACTIVE

          o ERROR

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive  string of up to 64 ASCII characters that
          you specify to make an idempotent API request. You should not  reuse
          the same client token for other API requests.

       --max-city-networks-to-monitor (integer)
          The maximum number of city-networks to monitor for your resources. A
          city-network is the location (city) where clients access your appli-
          cation  resources  from  and the network or ASN, such as an internet
          service provider, that clients access the resources through.

       --internet-measurements-log-delivery (structure)
          Publish internet measurements for Internet Monitor to another  loca-
          tion,  such  as  an Amazon S3 bucket. The measurements are also pub-
          lished to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

          S3Config -> (structure)
              The configuration information for  publishing  Internet  Monitor
              internet  measurements  to Amazon S3. The configuration includes
              the bucket name and (optionally) prefix for  the  S3  bucket  to
              store  the  measurements,  and the delivery status. The delivery
              status is ENABLED or DISABLED , depending on whether you  choose
              to deliver internet measurements to S3 logs.

              BucketName -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 bucket name.

              BucketPrefix -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 bucket prefix.

              LogDeliveryStatus -> (string)
                 The  status  of publishing Internet Monitor internet measure-
                 ments to an Amazon S3 bucket.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Config={BucketName=string,BucketPrefix=string,LogDeliveryStatus=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Config": {
              "BucketName": "string",
              "BucketPrefix": "string",
              "LogDeliveryStatus": "ENABLED"|"DISABLED"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)
