GET-HEALTH-EVENT()                                          GET-HEALTH-EVENT()



NAME
       get-health-event -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor has created and
       stored about a health event for a specified monitor.  This  information
       includes  the impacted locations, and all of the information related to
       the event by location.

       The information returned includes the  performance,  availability,  and
       round-trip  time  impact,  information about the network providers, the
       event type, and so on.

       Information rolled up at the global traffic level is also returned, in-
       cluding the impact type and total traffic impact.

OPTIONS
       --monitor-name (string)
          The name of the monitor.

       --event-id (string)
          The internally generated identifier of a health event. Because Even-
          tID contains the forward slash (/) character,  you  must  URL-encode
          the EventID field in the request URL.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

              zon CloudWatch Internet Monitor.

              Geographic regions are hierarchically categorized into  country,
              subdivision,  metro  and city geographic granularities. The geo-
              graphic region is identified based on the IP address used at the
              client locations.

              ASName -> (string)
                 The name of the network at an impacted location.

              ASNumber -> (long)
                 The  Autonomous  System Number (ASN) of the network at an im-
                 pacted location.

                 this is a  second-level  subdivision.  For  example,  in  the
                 United  Kingdom,  it  could  be a county, a London borough, a

              SubdivisionCode -> (string)
                 The  subdivision  code where the health event is located. The
                 ISO 3166-2 codes for country subdivisions is  provided,  when

                 impairments: Amazon Web Services network issues  or  internet
                 issues.  Internet  issues are typically a problem with a net-

                     percentage  of traffic that is not seeing an availability
                     drop. For example, an availability score of  99%  for  an
                     end user and service location pair is equivalent to 1% of
                     the traffic experiencing an availability  drop  for  that
                     pair.

                     ExperienceScore -> (double)
                        Experience scores, or health scores are calculated for
                        different geographic and network provider combinations
                        (that is, different  granularities)  and  also  summed
                        into  global scores. If you view performance or avail-
                        ability scores without filtering for any specific  ge-
