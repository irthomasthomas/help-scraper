OPTIONS
       --monitor-name (string)
          The name of the monitor to return data for.

       --query-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  query  that you want to return data results for. A
          QueryId is an internally-generated identifier for a specific query.

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of results. You receive this token from a
          previous call.

       --max-results (integer)
          The number of query results that you want to return with this call.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Fields -> (list)
          The fields that the query returns data  for.  Fields  are  name-data
          type pairs, such as availability_score -float .

          (structure)
              Defines  a  field  to query for your application's Amazon Cloud-
              Watch Internet Monitor data. You create  a  data  repository  by
              running  a  query  of a specific type. Each QueryType includes a
              specific set of fields and datatypes to retrieve data for.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of a field to query your application's Amazon Cloud-
                 Watch Internet Monitor data for, such as availability_score .

              Type -> (string)
                 The data type for a query field, which must correspond to the
                 field you're defining for QueryField . For  example,  if  the
                 query  field  name  is  availability_score , the data type is
                 float .

       Data -> (list)
          The data results that the query returns. Data is returned in arrays,
          aligned with the Fields for the query, which creates a repository of
          Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor information for your application.
          Then, you can filter the information in the repository by using Fil-
          terParameters that you define.

          (list)
              (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results. You receive this token from a
          previous call.
