OPTIONS
       --monitor-name (string)
          The name of the monitor.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

          The maximum number of city-networks to monitor for your resources. A
          city-network is the location (city) where clients access your appli-

          internet service provider (ISP), that clients access  the  resources
          through. This limit can help control billing costs.

          To learn more, see Choosing a city-network maximum value in the Ama-
          zon CloudWatch Internet Monitor section of the CloudWatch User Guide
          .

       InternetMeasurementsLogDelivery -> (structure)
          Publish  internet measurements for Internet Monitor to another loca-

              the  bucket  name  and  (optionally) prefix for the S3 bucket to
              store the measurements, and the delivery  status.  The  delivery
              status  is ENABLED or DISABLED , depending on whether you choose
              to deliver internet measurements to S3 logs.

       TrafficPercentageToMonitor -> (integer)
          The  percentage  of the internet-facing traffic for your application
          to monitor with this monitor. If you set  a  city-networks  maximum,

          monitor in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet  Monitor  section  of  the
          CloudWatch User Guide .

       HealthEventsConfig -> (structure)
          The  list  of  health  event threshold configurations. The threshold
          percentage for a health score determines, along with other  configu-
          ration  information,  when  Internet  Monitor creates a health event
          when there's an internet issue that  affects  your  application  end
          users.

              HealthScoreThreshold -> (double)
                 The health event threshold percentage set for a local  health
                 score.

              MinTrafficImpact -> (double)
                 The  minimum percentage of overall traffic for an application
                 that must be impacted by an  issue  before  Internet  Monitor
                 creates  an  event  when  a  threshold is crossed for a local
