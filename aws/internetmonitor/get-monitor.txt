OPTIONS
       --monitor-name (string)
          The name of the monitor.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       MaxCityNetworksToMonitor -> (integer)
          The maximum number of city-networks to monitor for your resources. A
          city-network is the location (city) where clients access your appli-
          cation  resources  from  and the network or ASN, such as an internet
          service provider (ISP), that clients access the  resources  through.
          This limit helps control billing costs.

          zon CloudWatch Internet Monitor section of the CloudWatch User Guide
          .
