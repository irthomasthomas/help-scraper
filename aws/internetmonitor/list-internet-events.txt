LIST-INTERNET-EVENTS()                                  LIST-INTERNET-EVENTS()



NAME
       list-internet-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists internet events that cause performance or availability issues for
       client locations. Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor displays  informa-
       tion  about  recent  global health events, called internet events, on a
       global outages map that is available to all Amazon  Web  Services  cus-
       tomers.

       You  can  constrain the list of internet events returned by providing a
       start time and end time to define a total time  frame  for  events  you
       want  to  list.  Both  start time and end time specify the time when an
       event started. End time is optional. If you don't include it,  the  de-
       fault end time is the current time.

       You  can also limit the events returned to a specific status (ACTIVE or
       RESOLVED ) or type (PERFORMANCE or AVAILABILITY ).

       list-internet-events is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: InternetEvents

OPTIONS
       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start time of the time window that you want to get a list of in-
          ternet events for.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end time of the time window that you want to get a list  of  in-
          ternet events for.

       --event-status (string)
          The status of an internet event.

       --event-type (string)
          The type of network impairment.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

       InternetEvents -> (list)
          A set of internet events returned for the list operation.

          (structure)
              A  summary  of  information  about  an  internet event in Amazon
              CloudWatch Internet Monitor. Internet  events  are  issues  that
              cause  performance  degradation or availability problems for im-
              pacted Amazon Web Services client  locations.  Internet  Monitor
              displays  information  about recent global health events, called
              internet events, on a global outages map that  is  available  to
              all Amazon Web Services customers.

              EventId -> (string)
                 The internally-generated identifier of an internet event.

              EventArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the internet event.

              StartedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time when an internet event started.

              EndedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  when  an internet event ended. If the event hasn't
                 ended yet, this value is empty.

              ClientLocation -> (structure)
                 The impacted location, such as a city, that Amazon  Web  Ser-
                 vices clients access application resources from.

                 ASName -> (string)
                     The  name  of the internet service provider (ISP) or net-
                     work (ASN).

                 ASNumber -> (long)
                     The Autonomous System Number (ASN) of the network  at  an
                     impacted location.

                 Country -> (string)
                     The  name  of the country where the internet event is lo-
                     cated.

                 Subdivision -> (string)
                     The subdivision location where the health  event  is  lo-
                     cated.  The  subdivision  usually  maps to states in most
                     countries (including the United States). For United King-
                     dom,  it  maps to a country (England, Scotland, Wales) or
                     province (Northern Ireland).

                 Metro -> (string)
                     The metro area where the health event is located.

                     Metro indicates  a  metropolitan  region  in  the  United
                     States,  such  as  the  region  around  New York City. In
                     non-US countries, this is a second-level subdivision. For
                     example,  in  the United Kingdom, it could be a county, a
                     London borough, a unitary authority, council area, and so
                     on.

                 Longitude -> (double)
                     The longitude where the internet event is located.

              EventType -> (string)
                 The type of network impairment.

              EventStatus -> (string)
                 The status of an internet event.

       NextToken -> (string)
