LIST-HEALTH-EVENTS()                                      LIST-HEALTH-EVENTS()



NAME
       list-health-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  health  events  for a monitor in Amazon CloudWatch Internet
       Monitor. Returns all information for health events including the client
       location  information the network cause and status, event start and end
       time, percentage of total traffic impacted, and status.

       NOTE:
          Health events that have start times during the time  frame  that  is
          requested are not included in the list of health events.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-health-events  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: HealthEvents

OPTIONS
       --monitor-name (string)
          The name of the monitor.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The time when a health event started.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The time when a health event ended. If the health event is still on-
          going, then the end time is not set.

       --event-status (string)
          The status of a health event.

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o RESOLVED

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                     in Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor.

                     Geographic  regions  are  hierarchically categorized into
                     country, subdivision, metro and city geographic granular-
                     ities.  The  geographic region is identified based on the
                     IP address used at the client locations.

                        countries (including the United  States).  For  United
                        Kingdom,  it  maps  to  a  country (England, Scotland,

                     Metro -> (string)
                        The metro area where the health event is located.

                        Metro indicates a metropolitan region  in  the  United

                        county, a London borough, a unitary authority, council
                        area, and so on.

                            score  of 99% for an end user and service location
                            pair is equivalent to 1% of the traffic experienc-
                            ing an availability drop for that pair.

                               ularities)  and also summed into global scores.

                               without filtering for any specific geography or
                               service provider,  Amazon  CloudWatch  Internet
                               Monitor provides global health scores.

                            performance drop. For example, a performance score
                            of  99%  for an end user and service location pair
                            is equivalent to 1% of the traffic experiencing  a
                            performance drop for that pair.
