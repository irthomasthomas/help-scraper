CREATE-RESOURCE()                                            CREATE-RESOURCE()



NAME
       create-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  the  specified  resource. For more information, see Creating a
       resource in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       After you have initiated a resource creation request, you  can  monitor
       the  progress of your request by calling GetResourceRequestStatus using
       the RequestToken of the ProgressEvent type returned by CreateResource .

OPTIONS
       --type-name (string)
          The name of the resource type.

       --type-version-id (string)
          For private resource types, the type version to use in this resource
          operation.  If you do not specify a resource version, CloudFormation
          uses the default version.

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
          (IAM)  role  for  Cloud  Control API to use when performing this re-
          source operation. The role specified must have the  permissions  re-
          quired  for this operation. The necessary permissions for each event
          handler are defined in the `` handlers `` section  of  the  resource
          type definition schema .

          If  you  do  not  specify a role, Cloud Control API uses a temporary
          session created using your Amazon Web Services user credentials.

          For more information, see Specifying credentials in the  Amazon  Web
          Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique  identifier  to ensure the idempotency of the resource re-
          quest. As a best practice, specify this token to ensure idempotency,
          so that Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API can accurately distin-
          guish between request retries and new resource requests.  You  might
          retry  a  resource  request  to  ensure that it was successfully re-
          ceived.

          A client token is valid for 36 hours once used. After  that,  a  re-
          source  request  with  the same client token is treated as a new re-
          quest.

          If you do not specify a client token, one is generated for inclusion
          in the request.

          For  more  information, see Ensuring resource operation requests are
          unique in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       --desired-state (string)
          Structured data format representing the desired  state  of  the  re-
          source,  consisting  of that resource's properties and their desired
          values.

          NOTE:
              Cloud Control API currently supports JSON as a  structured  data
              format.

          Specify the desired state as one of the following:

          o A JSON blob

          o A local path containing the desired state in JSON data format

          For  more  information,  see  Composing the desired state of the re-
          source in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

          For more information about the properties of  a  specific  resource,
          refer  to  the  related  topic  for the resource in the Resource and
          property types reference in the CloudFormation Users Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a resource

       The following create-resource example creates  an  AWS::Kinesis::Stream
       resource,  named  ResourceExample, with a retention period of 168 hours
       and a shard count of three.

          aws cloudcontrol create-resource \
              --type-name AWS::Kinesis::Stream \
              --desired-state "{\"Name\": \"ResourceExample\",\"RetentionPeriodHours\":168, \"ShardCount\":3}"

       Output:

          {
              "ProgressEvent": {
                  "EventTime": 1632506656.706,
                  "TypeName": "AWS::Kinesis::Stream",
                  "OperationStatus": "IN_PROGRESS",
                  "Operation": "CREATE",
                  "Identifier": "ResourceExample",
                  "RequestToken": "20999d87-e304-4725-ad84-832dcbfd7fc5"
              }
          }
