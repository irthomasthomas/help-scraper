LIST-RESOURCE-REQUESTS()                              LIST-RESOURCE-REQUESTS()



NAME
       list-resource-requests -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns existing resource operation requests. This includes requests of
       all status types. For more information, see Listing active resource op-
       eration  requests  in  the  Amazon  Web Services Cloud Control API User
       Guide .

       NOTE:
          Resource operation requests expire after 7 days.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-resource-requests is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: ResourceRequestStatusSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-resource-requests
          [--resource-request-status-filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-request-status-filter (structure)
          The filter criteria to apply to the requests returned.

          Operations -> (list)
              The operation types to include in the filter.

              (string)

          OperationStatuses -> (list)
              The operation statuses to include in the filter.

              o PENDING : The operation has been requested, but not yet initi-
                ated.

              o IN_PROGRESS : The operation is in progress.

              o SUCCESS : The operation completed.

              o FAILED : The operation failed.

              o CANCEL_IN_PROGRESS : The operation is in the process of  being
                canceled.

              o CANCEL_COMPLETE : The operation has been canceled.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Operations=string,string,OperationStatuses=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Operations": ["CREATE"|"DELETE"|"UPDATE", ...],
            "OperationStatuses": ["PENDING"|"IN_PROGRESS"|"SUCCESS"|"FAILED"|"CANCEL_IN_PROGRESS"|"CANCEL_COMPLETE", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the active resource operation requests

       The  following  list-resource-requests  example  lists the resource re-
       quests for CREATE and UPDATE operations that have failed  in  your  AWS
       account.

          aws cloudcontrol list-resource-requests \
              --resource-request-status-filter Operations=CREATE,OperationStatuses=FAILED

       Output:

          {
              "ResourceRequestStatusSummaries": [
                  {
                      "TypeName": "AWS::Kinesis::Stream",
                      "Identifier": "Demo",
                      "RequestToken": "e1a6b86e-46bd-41ac-bfba-633abcdfdbd7",
                      "Operation": "CREATE",
                      "OperationStatus": "FAILED",
                      "EventTime": 1632950268.481,
                      "StatusMessage": "Resource of type 'AWS::Kinesis::Stream' with identifier 'Demo' already exists.",
                      "ErrorCode": "AlreadyExists"
                  }
              ]

          The requests that match the specified filter criteria.

          (structure)
              Represents the current status of a resource  operation  request.
              For  more  information, see Managing resource operation requests
              in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

              TypeName -> (string)
                 The name of the resource type used in the operation.

              Identifier -> (string)
                 The primary identifier for the resource.

                 NOTE:
                     In some cases, the resource identifier may  be  available
                     before  the  resource  operation  has reached a status of
                     SUCCESS .

              RequestToken -> (string)
                 The unique token representing  this  resource  operation  re-
                 quest.

                 Use  the RequestToken with GetResourceRequestStatus to return
                 the current status of a resource operation request.

              Operation -> (string)
                 The resource operation type.

                 o PENDING : The resource operation hasn't yet started.

                 o IN_PROGRESS  :  The  resource  operation  is  currently  in
                   progress.

                 o SUCCESS  :  The  resource  operation  has successfully com-
                   pleted.

                 o FAILED : The resource operation has failed.  Refer  to  the
                   error code and status message for more information.

                 o CANCEL_IN_PROGRESS  :  The  resource  operation  is  in the
                   process of being canceled.

                 o CANCEL_COMPLETE : The resource operation has been canceled.

              EventTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the resource operation request was initiated.

              ResourceModel -> (string)
                 A JSON string containing the resource  model,  consisting  of
                 each resource property and its current value.

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 Any message explaining the current status.

                 CloudFormation  Command  Line Interface User Guide for Exten-
                 sion Development .

              RetryAfter -> (timestamp)
                 When to next request the status of  this  resource  operation
                 request.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the request doesn't return all of the remaining results, NextTo-
          ken is set to a token. To retrieve the next  set  of  results,  call
          ListResources  again  and  assign that token to the request object's
          NextToken parameter. If the request returns all  results,  NextToken
          is set to null.
