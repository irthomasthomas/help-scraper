NAME
       delete-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified resource. For details, see Deleting a resource in
       the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       After you have initiated a resource deletion request, you  can  monitor
       the  progress of your request by calling GetResourceRequestStatus using
       the RequestToken of the ProgressEvent returned by DeleteResource .

OPTIONS
       --type-name (string)
          The name of the resource type.

       --type-version-id (string)
          For private resource types, the type version to use in this resource
          operation.  If you do not specify a resource version, CloudFormation
          uses the default version.

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
          (IAM)  role  for  Cloud  Control API to use when performing this re-
          source operation. The role specified must have the  permissions  re-
          quired  for this operation. The necessary permissions for each event
          handler are defined in the `` handlers `` section  of  the  resource
          type definition schema .

          If  you  do  not  specify a role, Cloud Control API uses a temporary
          session created using your Amazon Web Services user credentials.

          For more information, see Specifying credentials in the  Amazon  Web
          Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique  identifier  to ensure the idempotency of the resource re-
          quest. As a best practice, specify this token to ensure idempotency,
          so that Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API can accurately distin-
          guish between request retries and new resource requests.  You  might
          retry  a  resource  request  to  ensure that it was successfully re-
          ceived.

          A client token is valid for 36 hours once used. After  that,  a  re-
          source  request  with  the same client token is treated as a new re-
          quest.

          If you do not specify a client token, one is generated for inclusion
          in the request.

          For  more  information, see Ensuring resource operation requests are
          unique in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       --identifier (string)
          The identifier for the resource.

          You can specify the primary identifier, or any secondary  identifier
          defined  for  the resource type in its resource schema. You can only
          specify one identifier. Primary identifiers can be  specified  as  a
          string or JSON; secondary identifiers must be specified as JSON.

          For compound primary identifiers (that is, one that consists of mul-
          tiple resource properties strung together), to specify  the  primary
          identifier  as  a string, list the property values in the order they
          are specified in the primary identifier definition, separated by | .

          For more information, see Identifying resources in  the  Amazon  Web
          Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete a resource

       The following delete-resource example  deletes  a  AWS::Kinesis::Stream
       resource with the identifier ResourceExample from your AWS account.

          aws cloudcontrol delete-resource \
              --type-name AWS::Kinesis::Stream \
              --identifier ResourceExample

       Output:

          {
              "ProgressEvent": {
                  "TypeName": "AWS::Kinesis::Stream",
                  "Identifier": "ResourceExample",
                  "RequestToken": "e48f26ff-d0f9-4ab8-a878-120db1edf111",
                  "Operation": "DELETE",
                  "OperationStatus": "IN_PROGRESS",
                  "EventTime": 1632950300.14
              }
          }

          After you have initiated a resource deletion request, you can  moni-
          tor the progress of your request by calling GetResourceRequestStatus
          using the RequestToken of the ProgressEvent  returned  by  DeleteRe-

                 fore the resource operation has reached a status of SUCCESS .

          RequestToken -> (string)
              The unique token representing this resource operation request.

              Any message explaining the current status.

          ErrorCode -> (string)
