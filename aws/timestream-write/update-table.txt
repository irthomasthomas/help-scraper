UPDATE-TABLE()                                                  UPDATE-TABLE()



NAME
       update-table -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  the retention duration of the memory store and magnetic store
       for your Timestream table. Note that the change in  retention  duration
       takes  effect  immediately. For example, if the retention period of the
       memory store was initially set to 2 hours and then changed to 24 hours,
       the  memory store will be capable of holding 24 hours of data, but will
       be populated with 24 hours of data 22 hours after this change was made.
       Timestream  does  not retrieve data from the magnetic store to populate
       the memory store.

       See code sample for details.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON

       the string will be taken literally.

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
