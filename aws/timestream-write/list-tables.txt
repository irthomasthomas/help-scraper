OPTIONS
       --database-name (string)
          The name of the Timestream database.

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token. To resume pagination,  provide  the  NextToken
          value as argument of a subsequent API invocation.

       --max-results (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the output. If the total num-
          ber of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken
          is provided in the output. To resume pagination, provide the NextTo-
          ken value as argument of a subsequent API invocation.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                     tributes used to partition the table data. The  order  of
                     the list determines the partition hierarchy. The name and
                     type of each partition key as well as the  partition  key
                     order  cannot be changed after the table is created. How-
                     ever, the enforcement level of each partition key can  be
                     changed.

                     (structure)
                        An  attribute  used in partitioning data in a table. A
                        dimension key partitions data using the values of  the
                        dimension specified by the dimension-name as partition
                        key, while a measure key partitions data using measure
                        names (values of the 'measure_name' column).

                        Type -> (string)
                            The  type of the partition key. Options are DIMEN-

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the attribute  used  for  a  dimension
                            key.

                        EnforcementInRecord -> (string)
                            The  level of enforcement for the specification of
                            a dimension key in ingested records.  Options  are
                            REQUIRED (dimension key must be specified) and OP-
                            TIONAL (dimension key does not have to  be  speci-
                            fied).

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.
