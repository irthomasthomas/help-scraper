NAME
       create-database -

DESCRIPTION

       database will be encrypted with a Timestream managed KMS key located in
       your  account.  For  more  information, see Amazon Web Services managed
       keys . Service quotas apply . For details, see code sample .

OPTIONS
       --database-name (string)
          The name of the Timestream database.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The KMS key for the database. If the KMS key is not  specified,  the
          database will be encrypted with a Timestream managed KMS key located
          in your account. For more information, see Amazon Web Services  man-
          aged keys .

       --tags (list)
          A list of key-value pairs to label the table.

          (structure)
              A tag is a label that you assign to a Timestream database and/or
              table. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of
              which you define. With tags, you can categorize databases and/or
              tables, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag. Tag keys are case sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag. Tag values are case-sensitive  and  can
                 be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Database -> (structure)
          The newly created Timestream database.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name that uniquely identifies this database.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              The name of the Timestream database.

          TableCount -> (long)
              The total number of tables found within a Timestream database.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              The identifier of the KMS key used to encrypt the data stored in
              the database.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The time when the database was created, calculated from the Unix
              epoch time.

          LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
              The last time that this database was updated.
