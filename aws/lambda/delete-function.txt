DELETE-FUNCTION()                                            DELETE-FUNCTION()



NAME
       delete-function -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  Lambda function. To delete a specific function version, use
       the Qualifier  parameter.  Otherwise,  all  versions  and  aliases  are
       deleted. This doesn't require the user to have explicit permissions for
       DeleteAlias .

       To delete Lambda event source mappings  that  invoke  a  function,  use
       DeleteEventSourceMapping  .  For  Amazon  Web  Servicesservices and re-
       sources that invoke your function directly, delete the trigger  in  the
       service where you originally configured it.

OPTIONS
       --function-name (string)
          The name or ARN of the Lambda function or version.
              Name formats

          o Function  name   my-function (name-only), my-function:1 (with ver-
            sion).

          o Function     ARN       arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:func-
            tion:my-function .

          o Partial ARN  123456789012:function:my-function .

          You  can append a version number or alias to any of the formats. The
          length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If you specify  only
          the function name, it is limited to 64 characters in length.

       --qualifier (string)
          Specify  a  version  to  delete.  You can't delete a version that an
          alias references.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To delete a Lambda function by function name

       The following delete-function example deletes the Lambda function named
       my-function by specifying the function's name.

          aws lambda delete-function \
              --function-name my-function

       This command produces no output.

       Example 2: To delete a Lambda function by function ARN

       The following delete-function example deletes the Lambda function named
       my-function by specifying the function's ARN.

          aws lambda delete-function \
              --function-name arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function

       This command produces no output.

       Example 3: To delete a Lambda function by partial function ARN

       The following delete-function example deletes the Lambda function named
       my-function by specifying the function's partial ARN.

          aws lambda delete-function \
              --function-name 123456789012:function:my-function

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see AWS Lambda Function Configuration in the  AWS
       Lambda Developer Guide.
