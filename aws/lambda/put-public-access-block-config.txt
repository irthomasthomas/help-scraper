NAME
       put-public-access-block-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Configure your function's public-access settings.

       To  control  public access to a Lambda function, you can choose whether
       to allow the creation of resource-based policies that allow public  ac-
       cess  to that function. You can also block public access to a function,
       even if it has an existing resource-based policy that allows it.

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function you want to configure
          public-access  settings  for.  Public-access settings are applied at
          the function level, so you can't apply different settings  to  func-
          tion versions or aliases.

       --public-access-block-config (structure)
          An object defining the public-access settings you want to apply.

          To  block  the  creation of resource-based policies that would grant
          public access to your function, set BlockPublicPolicy to true  .  To
          allow  the creation of resource-based policies that would grant pub-
          lic access to your function, set BlockPublicPolicy to false .

          To block public access to your function, even if its  resource-based
          policy allows it, set RestrictPublicResource to true . To allow pub-
          lic access to a function with a resource-based policy  that  permits
          it, set RestrictPublicResource to false .

          The default setting for both BlockPublicPolicy and RestrictPublicRe-
          source is true .

          BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
              To block the creation  of  resource-based  policies  that  would
              grant  public  access to your function, set BlockPublicPolicy to
              true . To allow the creation  of  resource-based  policies  that
              would  grant public access to your function, set BlockPublicPol-
              icy to false .

          RestrictPublicResource -> (boolean)
              To block public  access  to  your  function,  even  if  its  re-
              source-based  policy  allows  it,  set RestrictPublicResource to
              true .  To  allow  public  access  to  a  function  with  a  re-
              source-based  policy that permits it, set RestrictPublicResource
              to false .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          BlockPublicPolicy=boolean,RestrictPublicResource=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "BlockPublicPolicy": true|false,
            "RestrictPublicResource": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       PublicAccessBlockConfig -> (structure)
          The public-access settings Lambda applied to your function.

          BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
              To  block  the  creation  of  resource-based policies that would
              grant public access to your function, set  BlockPublicPolicy  to
              true  .  To  allow  the creation of resource-based policies that
              would grant public access to your function, set  BlockPublicPol-
              icy to false .

          RestrictPublicResource -> (boolean)
              To  block  public  access  to  your  function,  even  if its re-
              source-based policy allows  it,  set  RestrictPublicResource  to
              true  .  To  allow  public  access  to  a  function  with  a re-
