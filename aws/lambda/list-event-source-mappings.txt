LIST-EVENT-SOURCE-MAPPINGS()                      LIST-EVENT-SOURCE-MAPPINGS()



NAME
       list-event-source-mappings -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  event  source  mappings.  Specify an EventSourceArn to show only
       event source mappings for a single event source.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-event-source-mappings is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: EventSourceMappings

OPTIONS
       --event-source-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the event source.

          o Amazon Kinesis - The ARN of the data stream or a stream consumer.

          o Amazon DynamoDB Streams - The ARN of the stream.

          o Amazon Simple Queue Service - The ARN of the queue.

          o Amazon  Managed  Streaming for Apache Kafka - The ARN of the clus-
            ter.

       --function-name (string)
          The name of the Lambda function.
              Name formats

          o Function name - MyFunction .

          o Function ARN -  arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:My-
            Function .

          o Version or Alias ARN - arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:func-
            tion:MyFunction:PROD .

          o Partial ARN - 123456789012:function:MyFunction .

          The length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If  you  specify
          only the function name, it's limited to 64 characters in length.

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (list)
                        (string)

              MaximumRecordAgeInSeconds -> (integer)
                 (Streams  only) Discard records older than the specified age.
                 The default value is -1, which sets the maximum age to  infi-
                 nite.  When  the  value is set to infinite, Lambda never dis-
                 cards old records.

              BisectBatchOnFunctionError -> (boolean)
                 (Streams only) If the function returns an  error,  split  the
                 batch in two and retry. The default value is false.

              MaximumRetryAttempts -> (integer)
                 (Streams  only) Discard records after the specified number of
                 retries. The default value is -1, which sets the maximum num-
                 ber  of retries to infinite. When MaximumRetryAttempts is in-
                 finite, Lambda retries failed records until  the  record  ex-
                 pires in the event source.
