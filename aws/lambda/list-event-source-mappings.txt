LIST-EVENT-SOURCE-MAPPINGS()                      LIST-EVENT-SOURCE-MAPPINGS()



NAME
       list-event-source-mappings -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  event  source  mappings.  Specify an EventSourceArn to show only
       event source mappings for a single event source.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-event-source-mappings is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: EventSourceMappings

OPTIONS
       --event-source-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the event source.

          o Amazon Kinesis  The ARN of the data stream or a stream consumer.

          o Amazon DynamoDB Streams  The ARN of the stream.

          o Amazon Simple Queue Service  The ARN of the queue.

          o Amazon  Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka  The ARN of the cluster
            or the ARN of the VPC connection (for cross-account  event  source
            mappings ).

          o Amazon MQ  The ARN of the broker.

          o Amazon DocumentDB  The ARN of the DocumentDB change stream.

       --function-name (string)
          The name or ARN of the Lambda function.
              Name formats

          o Function name  MyFunction .

          o Function  ARN   arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:My-
            Function .

          o Version or Alias ARN   arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:func-
            tion:MyFunction:PROD .

          o Partial ARN  123456789012:function:MyFunction .

          The  length  constraint applies only to the full ARN. If you specify
          only the function name, it's limited to 64 characters in length.

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          A pagination token that's returned when the response doesn't contain
          all event source mappings.

       EventSourceMappings -> (list)
          A list of event source mappings.

          (structure)
              A mapping between an Amazon Web Services resource and  a  Lambda
              function. For details, see  CreateEventSourceMapping .

              UUID -> (string)
                 The identifier of the event source mapping.

              StartingPosition -> (string)
                 The  position  in  a  stream from which to start reading. Re-
                 quired for Amazon Kinesis and Amazon  DynamoDB  Stream  event
                 sources.  AT_TIMESTAMP  is  supported only for Amazon Kinesis
                 streams, Amazon  DocumentDB,  Amazon  MSK,  and  self-managed
                 Apache Kafka.

              StartingPositionTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 With  StartingPosition  set  to  AT_TIMESTAMP , the time from
                 which to start reading. StartingPositionTimestamp  cannot  be
                 in the future.

              BatchSize -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of records in each batch that Lambda pulls
                 from your stream or queue and sends to your function.  Lambda
                 passes  all  of the records in the batch to the function in a
                 single call, up to the payload limit for synchronous  invoca-
                 tion (6 MB).

                 Default value: Varies by service. For Amazon SQS, the default
                 is 10. For all other services, the default is 100.

                 Related setting: When you set BatchSize to  a  value  greater
                 than  10,  you  must set MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds to at
                 least 1.

              MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The maximum amount of time, in seconds,  that  Lambda  spends
                 gathering  records before invoking the function. You can con-
                 figure MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds to  any  value  from  0
                 seconds to 300 seconds in increments of seconds.

                 For  streams and Amazon SQS event sources, the default batch-
                 ing window is 0 seconds. For Amazon MSK, Self-managed  Apache
                 Kafka,  Amazon  MQ, and DocumentDB event sources, the default
                 batching window is 500 ms. Note that  because  you  can  only
                 change  MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds  in increments of sec-
                 onds, you cannot revert back to the 500 ms  default  batching
                 window  after  you  have  changed  it. To restore the default
                 batching window, you must create a new event source mapping.

                 Related setting: For streams and Amazon  SQS  event  sources,
                 when  you  set BatchSize to a value greater than 10, you must
                 set MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds to at least 1.

              ParallelizationFactor -> (integer)
                 (Kinesis and DynamoDB Streams only) The number of batches  to
                 process concurrently from each shard. The default value is 1.

              EventSourceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the event source.

              FilterCriteria -> (structure)
                 An  object  that  defines  the filter criteria that determine
                 whether Lambda should process an event. For more information,
                 see Lambda event filtering .

                 Filters -> (list)
                     A list of filters.

                     (structure)
                        A  structure  within  a FilterCriteria object that de-
                        fines an event filtering pattern.

                        Pattern -> (string)
                            A filter pattern. For more information on the syn-
                            tax of a filter pattern, see Filter rule syntax .

              FunctionArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the Lambda function.

              LastModified -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  that  the event source mapping was last updated or
                 that its state changed.

              LastProcessingResult -> (string)
                 The result of the last Lambda invocation of your function.

              State -> (string)
                 The state of the event source mapping. It can be one  of  the
                 following:  Creating  , Enabling , Enabled , Disabling , Dis-
                 abled , Updating , or Deleting .

              StateTransitionReason -> (string)
                 Indicates whether a user or Lambda made the  last  change  to
                 the event source mapping.

              DestinationConfig -> (structure)
                 (Kinesis,  DynamoDB  Streams,  Amazon  MSK,  and self-managed
                 Apache Kafka event sources only) A configuration object  that
                 specifies  the destination of an event after Lambda processes
                 it.

                 OnSuccess -> (structure)
                     The destination configuration for successful invocations.

                     Destination -> (string)

                        source.

                 OnFailure -> (structure)
                     The destination configuration for failed invocations.

                     Destination -> (string)
                        The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the destination re-
                        source.

                        To retain records of asynchronous  invocations  ,  you
                        can  configure  an Amazon SNS topic, Amazon SQS queue,
                        Lambda function, or Amazon EventBridge  event  bus  as
                        the destination.

                        To  retain  records of failed invocations from Kinesis
                        and DynamoDB event sources , you can configure an Ama-
                        zon SNS topic or Amazon SQS queue as the destination.

                        To   retain   records   of   failed  invocations  from
                        self-managed Kafka or Amazon MSK , you  can  configure
                        an  Amazon  SNS  topic, Amazon SQS queue, or Amazon S3
                        bucket as the destination.

              Topics -> (list)
                 The name of the Kafka topic.

                          for TLS encryption of your Apache Kafka brokers.

                     URI -> (string)
                        The value for your chosen configuration in Type .  For
                        example:          "URI":          "arn:aws:secretsman-
                        ager:us-east-1:01234567890:secret:MyBrokerSecretName"
                        .

              SelfManagedEventSource -> (structure)
                 The self-managed Apache Kafka cluster for your event source.

                 Endpoints -> (map)
                     The  list  of bootstrap servers for your Kafka brokers in
                     the    following    format:    "KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS":
                     ["abc.xyz.com:xxxx","abc2.xyz.com:xxxx"] .

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (list)
                        (string)

              MaximumRecordAgeInSeconds -> (integer)
                 (Kinesis  and  DynamoDB  Streams  only) Discard records older
                 than the specified age. The default value is -1,  which  sets
                 the  maximum  age to infinite. When the value is set to infi-
                 nite, Lambda never discards old records.

                 NOTE:
                     The minimum valid value for maximum record  age  is  60s.
                     Although  values  less  than  60 and greater than -1 fall
                     within the parameter's absolute range, they are  not  al-
                     lowed

              BisectBatchOnFunctionError -> (boolean)
                 (Kinesis  and  DynamoDB Streams only) If the function returns
                 an error, split the batch in two and retry. The default value
                 is false.

              MaximumRetryAttempts -> (integer)
                 (Kinesis and DynamoDB Streams only) Discard records after the
                 specified number of retries. The default value is  -1,  which
                 sets the maximum number of retries to infinite. When Maximum-
                 RetryAttempts is infinite, Lambda retries failed records  un-
                 til the record expires in the event source.

              TumblingWindowInSeconds -> (integer)
                 (Kinesis  and  DynamoDB Streams only) The duration in seconds
                 of a processing window for DynamoDB and Kinesis Streams event
                 sources. A value of 0 seconds indicates no tumbling window.

              FunctionResponseTypes -> (list)
                 (Kinesis, DynamoDB Streams, and Amazon SQS) A list of current
                 response type enums applied to the event source mapping.

              AmazonManagedKafkaEventSourceConfig -> (structure)
                 Specific configuration settings for an Amazon Managed Stream-
                 ing for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) event source.

                 ConsumerGroupId -> (string)
                     The  identifier for the Kafka consumer group to join. The
                     consumer group ID must be unique  among  all  your  Kafka
                     event  sources.  After creating a Kafka event source map-
                     ping with the consumer group ID specified, you cannot up-
                     date  this  value. For more information, see Customizable
                     consumer group ID .

              SelfManagedKafkaEventSourceConfig -> (structure)
                 Specific configuration settings  for  a  self-managed  Apache
                 Kafka event source.

                 ConsumerGroupId -> (string)
                     The  identifier for the Kafka consumer group to join. The
                     consumer group ID must be unique  among  all  your  Kafka
                     event  sources.  After creating a Kafka event source map-
                     ping with the consumer group ID specified, you cannot up-
                     date  this  value. For more information, see Customizable
                     consumer group ID .

              ScalingConfig -> (structure)
                 (Amazon SQS only) The scaling  configuration  for  the  event
                 source. For more information, see Configuring maximum concur-
                 rency for Amazon SQS event sources .

                 MaximumConcurrency -> (integer)
                     Limits the number of concurrent instances that the Amazon
                     SQS event source can invoke.

              DocumentDBEventSourceConfig -> (structure)
                 Specific   configuration  settings  for  a  DocumentDB  event
                 source.

                 DatabaseName -> (string)
                     The name of the database to consume within the DocumentDB
                     cluster.

                 CollectionName -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the collection to consume within the data-
                     base. If you do not specify a collection, Lambda consumes
                     all collections.

                 FullDocument -> (string)
                     Determines  what  DocumentDB  sends  to your event stream
                     during  document  update  operations.  If  set   to   Up-
                     dateLookup,  DocumentDB  sends  a  delta  describing  the
                     changes, along with a copy of the entire document. Other-
                     wise,  DocumentDB sends only a partial document that con-
                     tains the changes.
