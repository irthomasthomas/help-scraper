PUT-FUNCTION-EVENT-INVOKE-CONFIG()          PUT-FUNCTION-EVENT-INVOKE-CONFIG()



NAME
       put-function-event-invoke-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Configures  options for asynchronous invocation on a function, version,
       or alias. If a configuration already exists for a function, version, or
       alias,  this operation overwrites it. If you exclude any settings, they
       are removed. To set one option without affecting existing settings  for
       other options, use  UpdateFunctionEventInvokeConfig .

       By  default,  Lambda  retries  an  asynchronous invocation twice if the
       function returns an error. It retains events in a queue for up  to  six
       hours.  When  an  event  fails  all processing attempts or stays in the
       asynchronous invocation queue for too long, Lambda discards it. To  re-
       tain  discarded events, configure a dead-letter queue with  UpdateFunc-
       tionConfiguration .

       To send an invocation record to a queue, topic, S3 bucket, function, or
       event  bus, specify a destination . You can configure separate destina-
       tions for successful invocations (on-success) and events that fail  all
       processing attempts (on-failure). You can configure destinations in ad-
       dition to or instead of a dead-letter queue.

       NOTE:
          S3 buckets are supported only for on-failure destinations. To retain
          records of successful invocations, use another destination type.

OPTIONS
       --function-name (string)
          The name or ARN of the Lambda function, version, or alias.
              Name formats

          o Function  name  -  my-function  (name-only),  my-function:v1 (with
            alias).

          o Function   ARN    -    arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:func-
            tion:my-function .

          o Partial ARN - 123456789012:function:my-function .

          You  can append a version number or alias to any of the formats. The
          length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If you specify  only
          the function name, it is limited to 64 characters in length.

       --qualifier (string)
          A version number or alias name.

       --maximum-retry-attempts (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of times to retry when the function returns an
          error.

       --maximum-event-age-in-seconds (integer)
          The maximum age of a request that Lambda sends  to  a  function  for
          processing.

       --destination-config (structure)
          A destination for events after they have been sent to a function for
          processing.
              Destinations

          o Function - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a Lambda function.

          NOTE:
              S3 buckets are supported only for  on-failure  destinations.  To
              retain  records  of successful invocations, use another destina-
              tion type.

          OnSuccess -> (structure)
              The destination configuration for successful invocations.

              Destination -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the destination resource.

          OnFailure -> (structure)
              The destination configuration for failed invocations.

              Destination -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the destination resource.

                 To retain records of unsuccessful asynchronous invocations  ,
                 you can configure an Amazon SNS topic, Amazon SQS queue, Ama-
                 zon S3 bucket, Lambda function, or Amazon  EventBridge  event
                 bus as the destination.

                 To  retain  records  of  failed  invocations  from  Kinesis ,
                 DynamoDB , self-managed Kafka or Amazon MSK , you can config-
                 ure  an  Amazon  SNS  topic,  Amazon  SQS queue, or Amazon S3
                 bucket as the destination.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          OnSuccess={Destination=string},OnFailure={Destination=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "OnSuccess": {
              "Destination": "string"
            },
            "OnFailure": {
              "Destination": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To configure error handling for asynchronous invocation

       The  following  put-function-event-invoke-config example sets a maximum
       event age of one hour and disables retries for the specified function.

          aws lambda put-function-event-invoke-config \
              --function-name my-function \
              --maximum-event-age-in-seconds 3600 \
              --maximum-retry-attempts 0

       Output:

          {
              "LastModified": 1573686021.479,
              "FunctionArn": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:my-function:$LATEST",

              }
          }

          The date and time that the configuration was last updated.

       FunctionArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function.

       MaximumRetryAttempts -> (integer)
          The maximum number of times to retry when the  function  returns  an
          error.
