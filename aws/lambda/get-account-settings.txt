GET-ACCOUNT-SETTINGS()                                  GET-ACCOUNT-SETTINGS()



NAME
       get-account-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  details  about  your account's limits and usage in an Amazon
       Web Services Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-account-settings
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve details about your account in an AWS Region

       The following get-account-settings example displays the  Lambda  limits
       and usage information for your account.

          aws lambda get-account-settings

       Output:

          {
              "AccountLimit": {
                 "CodeSizeUnzipped": 262144000,
                 "UnreservedConcurrentExecutions": 1000,
                 "ConcurrentExecutions": 1000,
                 "CodeSizeZipped": 52428800,
                 "TotalCodeSize": 80530636800
              },
              "AccountUsage": {
                 "FunctionCount": 4,
                 "TotalCodeSize": 9426
              }
          }

       For more information, see AWS Lambda Limits in the AWS Lambda Developer
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       AccountLimit -> (structure)
          Limits that are related to concurrency and code storage.

          TotalCodeSize -> (long)
              The amount of storage space that you can use for all  deployment
              packages and layer archives.

          CodeSizeUnzipped -> (long)
              The  maximum  size of a function's deployment package and layers
              when they're extracted.

          CodeSizeZipped -> (long)
              The maximum size of a deployment package when it's uploaded  di-
              rectly to Lambda. Use Amazon S3 for larger files.

          ConcurrentExecutions -> (integer)
              The maximum number of simultaneous function executions.

          UnreservedConcurrentExecutions -> (integer)
              The  maximum  number  of simultaneous function executions, minus
              the capacity that's reserved for individual functions with  Put-
              FunctionConcurrency .

       AccountUsage -> (structure)
          The number of functions and amount of storage in use.

          TotalCodeSize -> (long)
              The  amount of storage space, in bytes, that's being used by de-
              ployment packages and layer archives.

          FunctionCount -> (long)
              The number of Lambda functions.
