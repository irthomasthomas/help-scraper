PUT-RESOURCE-POLICY()                                    PUT-RESOURCE-POLICY()



NAME
       put-resource-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          The  option  to create and modify full JSON resource-based policies,
          and to use the PutResourcePolicy, GetResourcePolicy,  and  DeleteRe-
          sourcePolicy APIs, won't be available in all Amazon Web Services Re-
          gions until September 30, 2024.

       Adds a resource-based policy to a function. You can use  resource-based
       policies  to  grant  access  to  other  Amazon  Web Services accounts ,
       organizations , or services . Resource-based policies apply to a single
       function, version, or alias.

       WARNING:
          Adding  a  resource-based  policy using this API action replaces any
          existing policy you've previously created. This means that if you've
          previously  added resource-based permissions to a function using the
          AddPermission action, those permissions will be overwritten by  your
          new policy.

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the function you want to add the
          policy to. You can use either a qualified or an unqualified ARN, but
          the value you specify must be a complete ARN and wildcard characters
          are not accepted.

       --policy (string)
          The JSON resource-based policy you want to add to your function.

          To learn more about creating resource-based policies for controlling
          access  to  Lambda,  see Working with resource-based IAM policies in
          Lambda in the Lambda Developer Guide .

       --revision-id (string)
          Replace the existing policy only if  its  revision  ID  matches  the
          string  you specify. To find the revision ID of the policy currently
          attached to your function, use the  GetResourcePolicy action.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Policy -> (string)
          The policy Lambda added to your function.

       RevisionId -> (string)
          The revision ID of the policy Lambda added to your function.
