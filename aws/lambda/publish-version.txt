PUBLISH-VERSION()                                            PUBLISH-VERSION()



NAME
       publish-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  version  from the current code and configuration of a func-
       tion. Use versions to create a snapshot of your function code and  con-
       figuration that doesn't change.

       Lambda  doesn't  publish  a version if the function's configuration and
       code haven't changed since the last version. Use  UpdateFunctionCode or
       UpdateFunctionConfiguration  to update the function before publishing a
       version.

       Clients can invoke versions directly or with an  alias.  To  create  an
       alias, use  CreateAlias .

OPTIONS
       --function-name (string)
          The name or ARN of the Lambda function.
              Name formats

          o Function name - MyFunction .

          o Function  ARN - arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:My-
            Function .

          o Partial ARN - 123456789012:function:MyFunction .

          The length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If  you  specify
          only the function name, it is limited to 64 characters in length.

       --code-sha256 (string)
          Only  publish  a  version if the hash value matches the value that's
          specified. Use this option to avoid  publishing  a  version  if  the
          function code has changed since you last updated it. You can get the
          hash for the version that you uploaded from the output  of   Update-
          FunctionCode .

       --description (string)
          A  description  for  the  version to override the description in the
          function configuration.

       --revision-id (string)
          Only update the function if the revision ID matches  the  ID  that's
          specified.  Use  this  option  to  avoid publishing a version if the
          function configuration has changed since you last updated it.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              group,  enter  an  existing  log  group or enter a new log group
              name.
