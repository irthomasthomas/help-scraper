CREATE-SERVICE()                                              CREATE-SERVICE()



NAME
       create-service -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor Spaces service.
       The account owner of the service is always the environment  owner,  re-
       gardless  of which account in the environment creates the service. Ser-
       vices have either a URL endpoint in a virtual private cloud (VPC), or a
       Lambda function endpoint.

       WARNING:
          If an Amazon Web Services resource is launched in a service VPC, and
          you want it to be accessible to all of an environments services with
          VPCs  and  routes,  apply the RefactorSpacesSecurityGroup to the re-
          source. Alternatively, to add more cross-account constraints,  apply
          your own security group.

OPTIONS
       --application-identifier (string)
          The ID of the application which the service is created.

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request.

       --description (string)
          The description of the service.

       --endpoint-type (string)
          The type of endpoint to use for the service. The type can be  a  URL
          in a VPC or an Lambda function.

          Possible values:

          o LAMBDA

          o URL

       --environment-identifier (string)
          The ID of the environment in which the service is created.

       --lambda-endpoint (structure)
          The configuration for the Lambda endpoint type.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda function or alias.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Arn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Arn": "string"
          }

       --name (string)
          The name of the service.

       --tags (map)
          The  tags to assign to the service. A tag is a label that you assign
          to an Amazon Web Services resource. Each tag consists of a key-value
          pair..

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --url-endpoint (structure)
          The  configuration  for the URL endpoint type. When creating a route
          to a service, Refactor Spaces automatically resolves the address  in
          the  UrlEndpointInput  object  URL when the Domain Name System (DNS)
          time-to-live (TTL) expires, or every 60 seconds for TTLs  less  than
          60 seconds.

          HealthUrl -> (string)
              The  health  check URL of the URL endpoint type. If the URL is a
              public endpoint, the HealthUrl must also be a  public  endpoint.
              If  the URL is a private endpoint inside a virtual private cloud
              (VPC), the health URL must also be a private endpoint,  and  the
              host must be the same as the URL.

          Url -> (string)
              The   URL   to   route   traffic   to.   The   URL  must  be  an
              rfc3986-formatted URL . If the host is a domain name,  the  name
              must  be  resolvable  over the public internet. If the scheme is
              https , the top level domain of the host must be listed  in  the
              IANA root zone database .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          HealthUrl=string,Url=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "HealthUrl": "string",
            "Url": "string"
          }

       --vpc-id (string)
          The ID of the VPC.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
