LIST-DATA-SET-REVISIONS()                            LIST-DATA-SET-REVISIONS()



NAME
       list-data-set-revisions -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation lists a data set's revisions sorted by CreatedAt in de-
       scending order.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-data-set-revisions is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: Revisions

OPTIONS
       --data-set-id (string)
          The unique identifier for a data set.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  value  retrieved from a previous call to access the next
          page of results.

       Revisions -> (list)
          The asset objects listed by the request.

          (structure)
              A revision is a container for one or more assets.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN for the revision.

              Comment -> (string)
                 An optional comment about the revision.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the revision was created, in ISO  8601
                 format.

              DataSetId -> (string)
                 The  unique  identifier  for the data set associated with the
                 data set revision.

              Finalized -> (boolean)
                 To publish a revision to a data set in a product,  the  revi-
                 sion must first be finalized. Finalizing a revision tells AWS
                 Data Exchange that your changes to the assets in the revision
                 are  complete.  After  it's  in this read-only state, you can
                 publish the revision to your  products.  Finalized  revisions
                 can be published through the AWS Data Exchange console or the
                 AWS Marketplace Catalog API,  using  the  StartChangeSet  AWS
                 Marketplace Catalog API action. When using the API, revisions
                 are uniquely identified by their ARN.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the revision.

              SourceId -> (string)
                 The revision ID of the owned revision  corresponding  to  the
                 entitled  revision  being  viewed. This parameter is returned
                 when a revision owner is viewing the  entitled  copy  of  its
                 owned revision.

              UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time that the revision was last updated, in ISO
                 8601 format.

              RevocationComment -> (string)
                 A required comment to inform subscribers of the reason  their
                 access to the revision was revoked.

              Revoked -> (boolean)
                 A  status indicating that subscribers' access to the revision
                 was revoked.

              RevokedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the revision was revoked, in ISO  8601
                 format.
