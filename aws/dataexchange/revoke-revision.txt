OPTIONS
       --data-set-id (string)
          The unique identifier for a data set.

       --revision-id (string)
          The unique identifier for a revision.

       --revocation-comment (string)
          A  required comment to inform subscribers of the reason their access
          to the revision was revoked.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The ARN for the revision.

       Comment -> (string)
          An optional comment about the revision.

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that the revision was created, in ISO 8601 format.

       DataSetId -> (string)
          The  unique  identifier  for the data set associated with this revi-
          sion.

       Finalized -> (boolean)
          To publish a revision to a data set in a product, the revision  must
          first  be  finalized.  Finalizing a revision tells AWS Data Exchange
          that changes to the assets in the revision are complete. After  it's
          in  this read-only state, you can publish the revision to your prod-
          ucts.

          Finalized revisions can be published through the AWS  Data  Exchange
          console or the AWS Marketplace Catalog API, using the StartChangeSet
          AWS Marketplace Catalog API action. When using  the  API,  revisions
          are uniquely identified by their ARN.

       Id -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the revision.

       SourceId -> (string)
          The  revision ID of the owned revision corresponding to the entitled
          revision being viewed. This parameter is returned  when  a  revision
          owner is viewing the entitled copy of its owned revision.

       UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and  time that the revision was last updated, in ISO 8601
          format.

       RevocationComment -> (string)
          A required comment to inform subscribers of the reason their  access
          to the revision was revoked.

       Revoked -> (boolean)
          A status indicating that subscribers' access to the revision was re-
          voked.

       RevokedAt -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that the revision was revoked, in ISO 8601 format.
