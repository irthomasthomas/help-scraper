LIST-JOB-RUNS()                                                LIST-JOB-RUNS()



NAME
       list-job-runs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists job runs based on a set of parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-job-runs  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: jobRuns

SYNOPSIS
            list-job-runs
          --application-id <value>
          [--created-at-after <value>]
          [--created-at-before <value>]
          [--states <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The ID of the application for which to list the job run.

       --created-at-after (timestamp)
          The lower bound of the option to filter by creation date and time.

       --created-at-before (timestamp)
          The upper bound of the option to filter by creation date and time.

       --states (list)
          An optional filter for job run states. Note that if this filter con-
          tains  multiple  states,  the  resulting list will be grouped by the
          state.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            SUBMITTED
            PENDING
            SCHEDULED
            RUNNING
            SUCCESS
            FAILED
            CANCELLING
            CANCELLED

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       jobRuns -> (list)

              executionRole -> (string)
                 The execution role ARN of the job run.

              state -> (string)
                 The state of the job run.

              stateDetails -> (string)
                 The state details of the job run.

              releaseLabel -> (string)
                 The EMR release version associated with the application  your
                 job is running on.

          The  output  displays the token for the next set of job run results.
          This is required for pagination and is available as  a  response  of
          the previous request.
