OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The app monitor to retrieve information for.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       AppMonitor -> (structure)
          A structure containing all the configuration information for the app
          monitor.

          AppMonitorConfiguration -> (structure)
              A structure that contains much of the configuration data for the
              app monitor.

              AllowCookies -> (boolean)
                 If you set this to true , the RUM web client sets  two  cook-
                 ies,  a  session  cookie and a user cookie. The cookies allow
                 the RUM web client to collect data relating to the number  of
                 users  an application has and the behavior of the application
                 across a sequence  of  events.  Cookies  are  stored  in  the
                 top-level domain of the current page.

              EnableXRay -> (boolean)
                 If  you  set this to true , RUM enables X-Ray tracing for the
                 user sessions that RUM  samples.  RUM  adds  an  X-Ray  trace
                 header  to  allowed  HTTP  requests. It also records an X-Ray
                 segment for allowed HTTP requests. You  can  see  traces  and
                 segments  from  these  user sessions in the X-Ray console and
                 the CloudWatch ServiceLens console. For more information, see
                 What is X-Ray?

              ExcludedPages -> (list)
                 A list of URLs in your website or application to exclude from
                 RUM data collection.

                 You can't include both ExcludedPages and IncludedPages in the
                 same operation.

                 (string)

              FavoritePages -> (list)
                 A  list of pages in your application that are to be displayed
                 with a "favorite" icon in the CloudWatch RUM console.

                 (string)

              GuestRoleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the guest IAM role that is attached to the  Amazon
                 Cognito  identity  pool that is used to authorize the sending
                 of data to RUM.

                 NOTE:
                     It is possible that an app monitor does not have a  value
                     for  GuestRoleArn . For example, this can happen when you
                     use the console to create an app monitor  and  you  allow
                     CloudWatch  RUM  to create a new identity pool for Autho-
                     rization. In this case, GuestRoleArn is  not  present  in
                     the  GetAppMonitor  response  because it is not stored by
                     the service.

                     If this issue affects you, you can take one of  the  fol-
                     lowing steps:

                     o Use  the Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to create an iden-
                       tity pool and the associated IAM role, and use that for
                       your app monitor.

                     o Make  a  separate  GetIdentityPoolRoles  call to Amazon
                       Cognito to retrieve the GuestRoleArn .

              IdentityPoolId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Amazon Cognito identity pool that  is  used  to
                 authorize the sending of data to RUM.

              IncludedPages -> (list)
                 If  this  app  monitor  is  to collect data from only certain
                 pages in your application, this structure lists those pages.

                 You can't include both ExcludedPages and IncludedPages in the
                 same operation.

                 (string)

              SessionSampleRate -> (double)
                 Specifies  the  portion  of user sessions to use for RUM data
                 collection. Choosing a higher portion gives you more data but
                 also incurs more costs.

                 The range for this value is 0 to 1 inclusive. Setting this to
                 1 means that 100% of user sessions are sampled,  and  setting
                 it to 0.1 means that 10% of user sessions are sampled.

                 If  you  omit this parameter, the default of 0.1 is used, and
                 10% of sessions will be sampled.

              Telemetries -> (list)
                 An array that lists the types of telemetry data that this app
                 monitor is to collect.

                 o errors  indicates  that  RUM  collects data about unhandled
                   JavaScript errors raised by your application.

                 o performance indicates that RUM  collects  performance  data
                   about how your application and its resources are loaded and
                   rendered. This includes Core Web Vitals.

                 o http indicates that RUM collects  data  about  HTTP  errors
                   thrown by your application.

                 (string)

          Created -> (string)
              The date and time that this app monitor was created.

          CustomEvents -> (structure)
              Specifies  whether this app monitor allows the web client to de-
              fine and send custom events.

              For more information about custom events, see Send custom events
              .

              Status -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether  this app monitor allows the web client to
                 define and send custom events.  The  default  is  for  custom
                 events to be DISABLED .

          DataStorage -> (structure)
              A  structure  that  contains  information about whether this app
              monitor stores a copy of the telemetry data  that  RUM  collects
              using CloudWatch Logs.

              CwLog -> (structure)
                 A  structure  that contains the information about whether the
                 app monitor stores copies of the data that  RUM  collects  in
                 CloudWatch Logs. If it does, this structure also contains the
                 name of the log group.

                 CwLogEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Indicated whether the app monitor stores  copies  of  the
                     data that RUM collects in CloudWatch Logs.
