BATCH-GET-RUM-METRIC-DEFINITIONS()          BATCH-GET-RUM-METRIC-DEFINITIONS()



NAME
       batch-get-rum-metric-definitions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the list of metrics and dimensions that a RUM app monitor is
       sending to a single destination.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       batch-get-rum-metric-definitions is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: MetricDefinitions

OPTIONS
       --app-monitor-name (string)
          The  name of the CloudWatch RUM app monitor that is sending the met-
          rics.

       --destination (string)
          The type of destination that you want to  view  metrics  for.  Valid
          values are CloudWatch and Evidently .

          Possible values:

          o CloudWatch

          o Evidently

       --destination-arn (string)
          This parameter is required if Destination is Evidently . If Destina-
          tion is CloudWatch , do not use this parameter.

          This parameter specifies the ARN of the  Evidently  experiment  that
          corresponds to the destination.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       MetricDefinitions -> (list)
          An  array  of  structures that display information about the metrics
          that are sent by the specified app monitor to the specified destina-
          tion.

          (structure)
              A  structure that displays the definition of one extended metric
              that RUM sends to CloudWatch or CloudWatch Evidently.  For  more
              information,  see Additional metrics that you can send to Cloud-
              Watch and CloudWatch Evidently .

              DimensionKeys -> (map)
                 This field is a map of field paths to dimension names. It de-
                 fines  the dimensions to associate with this metric in Cloud-
                 Watch The value of this field is used only if the metric des-
                 tination  is  CloudWatch  . If the metric destination is Evi-
                 dently , the value of DimensionKeys is ignored.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              EventPattern -> (string)
                 The pattern that defines the metric. RUM checks  events  that
                 happen  in  a  user's session against the pattern, and events
                 that match the pattern are sent to the metric destination.

                 If the metrics destination is CloudWatch and the  event  also
                 matches  a  value  in DimensionKeys , then the metric is pub-
                 lished with the specified dimensions.

              MetricDefinitionId -> (string)
                 The ID of this metric definition.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the metric that is defined in this structure.

              UnitLabel -> (string)
                 Use this field only if you are sending this metric to  Cloud-
                 Watch. It defines the CloudWatch metric unit that this metric
                 is measured in.

              ValueKey -> (string)
                 The field within the event object that the  metric  value  is
                 sourced from.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that you can use in a subsequent operation to retrieve the
          next set of results.
