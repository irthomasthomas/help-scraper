BATCH-DELETE-RUM-METRIC-DEFINITIONS()    BATCH-DELETE-RUM-METRIC-DEFINITIONS()



NAME
       batch-delete-rum-metric-definitions -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  the  specified  metrics from being sent to an extended metrics
       destination.

       If some metric definition IDs specified in a  BatchDeleteRumMetricDefi-
       nitions operations are not valid, those metric definitions fail and re-
       turn errors, but all valid metric definition IDs in the same  operation
       are still deleted.

       The  maximum  number  of metric definitions that you can specify in one
       BatchDeleteRumMetricDefinitions operation is 200.

OPTIONS
       --app-monitor-name (string)
          The name of the CloudWatch RUM app monitor  that  is  sending  these
          metrics.

       --destination (string)
          Defines the destination where you want to stop sending the specified
          metrics. Valid values are CloudWatch and Evidently . If you  specify
          Evidently , you must also specify the ARN of the CloudWatchEvidently
          experiment that is to be the destination and an IAM  role  that  has
          permission to write to the experiment.

          Possible values:

          o CloudWatch

          o Evidently

       --destination-arn (string)
          This parameter is required if Destination is Evidently . If Destina-
          tion is CloudWatch , do not use this parameter.

          This parameter specifies the ARN of the  Evidently  experiment  that
          was receiving the metrics that are being deleted.

       --metric-definition-ids (list)
          An  array  of  structures  which define the metrics that you want to
          stop sending.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Errors -> (list)
          An array of error objects, if the operation caused any errors.

          (structure)
              A   structure   that   defines   one   error   caused    by    a
              BatchCreateRumMetricsDefinitions operation.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The error code.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The error message for this metric definition.

              MetricDefinitionId -> (string)
                 The ID of the metric definition that caused this error.

       MetricDefinitionIds -> (list)
          The IDs of the metric definitions that were deleted.

          (string)
