NAME
       put-rum-metrics-destination -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or  updates  a  destination  to  receive extended metrics from
       CloudWatch RUM. You can send extended metrics to  CloudWatch  or  to  a
       CloudWatch Evidently experiment.

       For     more     information     about     extended     metrics,    see
       BatchCreateRumMetricDefinitions .

OPTIONS
       --app-monitor-name (string)
          The name of the CloudWatch RUM app monitor that will send  the  met-
          rics.

       --destination (string)
          Defines  the  destination  to  send the metrics to. Valid values are
          CloudWatch and Evidently . If you specify Evidently , you must  also
          specify  the ARN of the CloudWatchEvidently experiment that is to be
          the destination and an IAM role that has permission to write to  the
          experiment.

          Possible values:

          o CloudWatch

          o Evidently

       --destination-arn (string)
          Use this parameter only if Destination is Evidently . This parameter
          specifies the ARN of the Evidently experiment that will receive  the
          extended metrics.

       --iam-role-arn (string)
          This parameter is required if Destination is Evidently . If Destina-
          tion is CloudWatch , don't use this parameter.

          This parameter specifies the ARN of an IAM role that RUM will assume
          to  write  to  the Evidently experiment that you are sending metrics
          to. This role must have permission to write to that experiment.

          If you specify this parameter, you must be signed on to a role  that
          has  PassRole  permissions  attached  to it, to allow the role to be
          passed. The CloudWatchAmazonCloudWatchRUMFullAccess  policy  doesn't
          include PassRole permissions.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       None
