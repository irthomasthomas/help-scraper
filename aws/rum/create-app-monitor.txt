CREATE-APP-MONITOR()                                      CREATE-APP-MONITOR()



NAME
       create-app-monitor -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  Amazon CloudWatch RUM app monitor, which collects telemetry
       data from your application and sends that data to  RUM.  The  data  in-
       cludes  performance and reliability information such as page load time,
       client-side errors, and user behavior.

       You use this operation only to create a new app monitor. To  update  an
       existing app monitor, use UpdateAppMonitor instead.

       After  you create an app monitor, sign in to the CloudWatch RUM console
       to get the JavaScript code snippet to add to your web application.  For
       more  information,  see  How do I find a code snippet that I've already
       generated?

OPTIONS
       --app-monitor-configuration (structure)
          A structure that contains much of the configuration data for the app
          monitor. If you are using Amazon Cognito for authorization, you must
          include this structure in your request, and it must include  the  ID
          of the Amazon Cognito identity pool to use for authorization. If you
          don't include AppMonitorConfiguration , you must set up your own au-
          thorization  method. For more information, see Authorize your appli-
          cation to send data to Amazon Web Services .

          If you omit this argument, the sample rate used for RUM  is  set  to
          10% of the user sessions.

          AllowCookies -> (boolean)
              If you set this to true , the RUM web client sets two cookies, a
              session cookie and a user cookie. The cookies allow the RUM  web
              client to collect data relating to the number of users an appli-
              cation has and the behavior of the application across a sequence
              of  events.  Cookies  are  stored in the top-level domain of the
              current page.

          EnableXRay -> (boolean)
              If you set this to true , RUM enables X-Ray tracing for the user
              sessions that RUM samples. RUM adds an X-Ray trace header to al-
              lowed HTTP requests. It also records an X-Ray  segment  for  al-
              lowed  HTTP requests. You can see traces and segments from these
              user sessions in the X-Ray console and the  CloudWatch  Service-
              Lens console. For more information, see What is X-Ray?

          ExcludedPages -> (list)
              A  list  of  URLs in your website or application to exclude from
              RUM data collection.

              You can't include both ExcludedPages and  IncludedPages  in  the
              same operation.

              (string)

          FavoritePages -> (list)
              A  list  of  pages  in your application that are to be displayed
              with a "favorite" icon in the CloudWatch RUM console.

              (string)

          GuestRoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the guest IAM role that is  attached  to  the  Amazon
              Cognito  identity  pool that is used to authorize the sending of
              data to RUM.

          IdentityPoolId -> (string)
              The ID of the Amazon Cognito identity pool that is used  to  au-
              thorize the sending of data to RUM.

          IncludedPages -> (list)
              If  this  app monitor is to collect data from only certain pages
              in your application, this structure lists those pages.

              You can't include both ExcludedPages and  IncludedPages  in  the
              same operation.

              (string)

          SessionSampleRate -> (double)
              Specifies  the portion of user sessions to use for RUM data col-
              lection. Choosing a higher portion gives you more data but  also
              incurs more costs.

              The  range for this value is 0 to 1 inclusive. Setting this to 1
              means that 100% of user sessions are sampled, and setting it  to
              0.1 means that 10% of user sessions are sampled.

              If  you omit this parameter, the default of 0.1 is used, and 10%
              of sessions will be sampled.

          Telemetries -> (list)
              An array that lists the types of telemetry data  that  this  app
              monitor is to collect.

              o errors  indicates that RUM collects data about unhandled Java-
                Script errors raised by your application.

              o performance indicates that RUM collects performance data about
                how  your  application  and  its resources are loaded and ren-
                dered. This includes Core Web Vitals.

              o http indicates that RUM collects data about HTTP errors thrown
                by your application.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AllowCookies=boolean,EnableXRay=boolean,ExcludedPages=string,string,FavoritePages=string,string,GuestRoleArn=string,IdentityPoolId=string,IncludedPages=string,string,SessionSampleRate=double,Telemetries=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AllowCookies": true|false,
            "EnableXRay": true|false,
            "ExcludedPages": ["string", ...],
            "FavoritePages": ["string", ...],
            "GuestRoleArn": "string",
            "IdentityPoolId": "string",
            "IncludedPages": ["string", ...],
            "SessionSampleRate": double,
            "Telemetries": ["errors"|"performance"|"http", ...]
          }

       --custom-events (structure)
          Specifies  whether  this app monitor allows the web client to define
          and send custom events. If you omit this  parameter,  custom  events
          are DISABLED .

          For more information about custom events, see Send custom events .

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies  whether this app monitor allows the web client to de-
              fine and send custom events. The default is for custom events to
              be DISABLED .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Status=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Status": "ENABLED"|"DISABLED"
          }

       --cw-log-enabled | --no-cw-log-enabled (boolean)
          Data  collected  by RUM is kept by RUM for 30 days and then deleted.
          This parameter specifies whether RUM sends a copy of this  telemetry
          data  to Amazon CloudWatch Logs in your account. This enables you to
          keep the telemetry data for more than 30 days,  but  it  does  incur
          Amazon CloudWatch Logs charges.

          If you omit this parameter, the default is false .

       --domain (string)
          The  top-level  internet  domain name for which your application has
          administrative authority.

       --name (string)
          A name for the app monitor.

       --tags (map)
          Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the app monitor.

          Tags can help you organize and categorize your  resources.  You  can
          also  use  them to scope user permissions by granting a user permis-
          sion to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

          Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and  are
          interpreted strictly as strings of characters.

          You can associate as many as 50 tags with an app monitor.

          For more information, see Tagging Amazon Web Services resources .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
