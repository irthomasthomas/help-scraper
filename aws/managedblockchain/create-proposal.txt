       the network can vote on, for example, a proposal to add a new member to
       the network. Any member can create a proposal.

       Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.

OPTIONS
       --client-request-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the operation. An idempotent operation  completes  no
          more  than  one time. This identifier is required only if you make a
          service request directly using an HTTP client. It is generated auto-
          matically if you use an Amazon Web Services SDK or the CLI.

       --network-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the network for which the proposal is made.

       --member-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier of the member that is creating the proposal.
          This identifier is especially useful for identifying the member mak-
          ing  the proposal when multiple members exist in a single Amazon Web
          Services account.

       --actions (structure)
          The type of actions proposed, such as inviting a member or  removing
          a member. The types of Actions in a proposal are mutually exclusive.
          For example, a proposal with Invitations actions cannot also contain
          Removals actions.

          Invitations -> (list)
              The  actions  to  perform  for an APPROVED proposal to invite an
              Amazon Web Services account to create a member and join the net-
              work.

              (structure)
                 An action to invite a specific Amazon Web Services account to
                 create a member and join the  network.  The  InviteAction  is
                 carried out when a Proposal is APPROVED .

                 Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.

                 Principal -> (string)
                     The Amazon Web Services account ID to invite.

          Removals -> (list)
              The actions to perform for an APPROVED proposal to remove a mem-
              ber from the network, which deletes the member and  all  associ-
              ated member resources from the network.

              (structure)
                 An  action  to remove a member from a Managed Blockchain net-
                 work as the result of a removal proposal that is  APPROVED  .
                 The  member and all associated resources are deleted from the
                 network.

                 Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.

                 MemberId -> (string)
                     The unique identifier of the member to remove.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Invitations=[{Principal=string},{Principal=string}],Removals=[{MemberId=string},{MemberId=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Invitations": [
              {
                "Principal": "string"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "Removals": [
              {
                "MemberId": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --description (string)
          A description for the proposal that is visible  to  voting  members,
          for example, "Proposal to add Example Corp. as member."

       --tags (map)
          Tags to assign to the proposal.

          Each  tag  consists  of a key and an optional value. You can specify
          multiple key-value pairs in a single request with an overall maximum
          of 50 tags allowed per resource.

          For more information about tags, see Tagging Resources in the Amazon
          Managed Blockchain Ethereum Developer Guide , or  Tagging  Resources
          in  the Amazon Managed Blockchain Hyperledger Fabric Developer Guide
          .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
