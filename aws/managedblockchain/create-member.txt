OPTIONS
       --client-request-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the operation. An idempotent operation  completes  no
          more  than  one time. This identifier is required only if you make a
          service request directly using an HTTP client. It is generated auto-
          matically if you use an Amazon Web Services SDK or the CLI.

       --invitation-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier of the invitation that is sent to the member
          to join the network.

       --network-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the network in which the member is created.

       --member-configuration (structure)
          Member configuration parameters.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the member.

          Description -> (string)
              An optional description of the member.

          FrameworkConfiguration -> (structure)
              Configuration properties of the blockchain framework relevant to
              the member.

              Fabric -> (structure)
                 Attributes  of  Hyperledger  Fabric for a member on a Managed
                 Blockchain network that uses Hyperledger Fabric.

                 AdminUsername -> (string)
                     The user name for  the  member's  initial  administrative
                     user.

                 AdminPassword -> (string)
                     The  password  for  the  member's  initial administrative
                     user. The AdminPassword must be  at  least  8  characters
                     long  and  no more than 32 characters. It must contain at
                     least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one
                     digit.  It cannot have a single quotation mark (), a dou-
                     ble quotation marks (), a forward  slash(/),  a  backward
                     slash(), @, or a space.

          LogPublishingConfiguration -> (structure)
              Configuration  properties  for  logging events associated with a
              member of a Managed Blockchain network.

                 Configuration properties for logging events associated with a
                 member  of a Managed Blockchain network using the Hyperledger
                 Fabric framework.

                 CaLogs -> (structure)
                     Configuration properties for  logging  events  associated
                     with  a member's Certificate Authority (CA). CA logs help
                     you determine when a member in  your  account  joins  the
                     network, or when new peers register with a member CA.

                     Cloudwatch -> (structure)
                        Parameters  for  publishing  logs to Amazon CloudWatch

          Tags -> (map)
              Tags assigned to the member. Tags consist of a key and  optional
              value.

              When  specifying  tags during creation, you can specify multiple
              key-value pairs in a single request, with an overall maximum  of
              50 tags added to each resource.

              For  more  information  about tags, see Tagging Resources in the
              Amazon Managed Blockchain Ethereum Developer Guide , or  Tagging
              Resources  in  the  Amazon Managed Blockchain Hyperledger Fabric
              Developer Guide .

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          KmsKeyArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the customer  managed  key  in
              Key  Management  Service  (KMS) to use for encryption at rest in
              the member. This parameter is inherited by any nodes  that  this
              member  creates. For more information, see Encryption at Rest in
              the Amazon Managed Blockchain Hyperledger Fabric Developer Guide
              .

              Use one of the following options to specify this parameter:

              o Undefined or empty string - By default, use an KMS key that is
                owned and managed by Amazon Web Services on your behalf.

              o A valid symmetric customer managed KMS key - Use the specified
                KMS key in your account that you create, own, and manage. Ama-
                zon Managed Blockchain doesn't support  asymmetric  keys.  For
                more  information,  see Using symmetric and asymmetric keys in
                the Key Management Service Developer Guide . The following  is
                an       example       of       a       KMS      key      ARN:
                arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)
