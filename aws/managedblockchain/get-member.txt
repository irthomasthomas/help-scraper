OPTIONS
       --network-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the network to which the member belongs.

       --member-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the member.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                     with  a member's Certificate Authority (CA). CA logs help
                     you determine when a member in  your  account  joins  the
                     network, or when new peers register with a member CA.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of a member.

              o CREATING - The Amazon Web Services account is in  the  process
                of creating a member.

              o AVAILABLE - The member has been created and can participate in
                the network.

              o CREATE_FAILED - The Amazon Web Services account  attempted  to
                create a member and creation failed.

              o UPDATING - The member is in the process of being updated.

              o DELETING  - The member and all associated resources are in the
                process of being deleted. Either the Amazon Web  Services  ac-
                count  that owns the member deleted it, or the member is being
                deleted as the result of an APPROVED  PROPOSAL to  remove  the
                member.

              o DELETED  - The member can no longer participate on the network
                and all associated resources are deleted.  Either  the  Amazon
                Web  Services  account that owns the member deleted it, or the
                member is being deleted as the result of an APPROVED  PROPOSAL
                to remove the member.

              o INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_KEY - The member is impaired and might
                not function as expected because it cannot access  the  speci-
                fied  customer  managed key in KMS for encryption at rest. Ei-
                ther the KMS key was disabled or deleted, or the grants on the
                key were revoked. The effect of disabling or deleting a key or
                of revoking a grant isn't immediate. It might take  some  time
                for the member resource to discover that the key is inaccessi-
                ble. When a resource is in this state, we  recommend  deleting
                and recreating the resource.

          CreationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the member was created.

          Tags -> (map)
              Tags  assigned to the member. Tags consist of a key and optional
              value. For more information about tags, see Tagging Resources in
              the Amazon Managed Blockchain Hyperledger Fabric Developer Guide
              .

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the member. For more  informa-
              tion  about  ARNs  and  their  format, see Amazon Resource Names
              (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

          KmsKeyArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the customer  managed  key  in
              Key Management Service (KMS) that the member uses for encryption
              at rest. If the value of this parameter is "AWS Owned KMS Key" ,
              the member uses an Amazon Web Services owned KMS key for encryp-
              tion. This parameter is inherited by the nodes that this  member
              owns.

              aged Blockchain Hyperledger Fabric Developer Guide .
