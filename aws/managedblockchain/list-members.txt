OPTIONS
       --network-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the network for which to list members.

       --name (string)
          The optional name of the member to list.

       --status (string)
          An optional status specifier. If provided, only members currently in
          this status are listed.

          Possible values:

          o CREATING

          o AVAILABLE

          o CREATE_FAILED

          o UPDATING

          o DELETING

          o DELETED

          o INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_KEY

       --is-owned | --no-is-owned (boolean)
          An  optional  Boolean value. If provided, the request is limited ei-
          ther to members that the current Amazon Web  Services  account  owns
          (true ) or that other Amazon Web Services accountsn own (false ). If
          omitted, all members are listed.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of members to return in the request.

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token that indicates the next set of results  to  re-
          trieve.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Members -> (list)
          An  array  of  MemberSummary  objects.  Each object contains details
          about a network member.

          (structure)
              A summary of configuration properties for a member.

              Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the member.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the member.

              Description -> (string)
                 An optional description of the member.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the member.

                 o CREATING - The  Amazon  Web  Services  account  is  in  the
                   process of creating a member.

                 o AVAILABLE - The member has been created and can participate
                   in the network.

                 o CREATE_FAILED - The Amazon Web Services  account  attempted
                   to create a member and creation failed.

                 o UPDATING - The member is in the process of being updated.

                 o DELETING  -  The member and all associated resources are in
                   the process of being deleted. Either the  Amazon  Web  Ser-
                   vices  account that owns the member deleted it, or the mem-
                   ber is being deleted as the result of an APPROVED  PROPOSAL
                   to remove the member.

                 o DELETED  - The member can no longer participate on the net-
                   work and all associated resources are deleted.  Either  the
                   Amazon  Web  Services  account that owns the member deleted
                   it, or the member is being deleted as the result of an  AP-
                   PROVED  PROPOSAL to remove the member.

                 o INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_KEY  -  The  member is impaired and
                   might not function as expected because it cannot access the
                   specified  customer  managed  key in Key Management Service
                   (KMS) for encryption at rest. Either the KMS key  was  dis-
                   abled  or  deleted,  or the grants on the key were revoked.
                   The effect of disabling or deleting a key or of revoking  a
                   grant isn't immediate. It might take some time for the mem-
                   ber resource to discover that the key is inaccessible. When
                   a  resource  is  in  this  state, we recommend deleting and
                   recreating the resource.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the member was created.

              IsOwned -> (boolean)
                 An indicator of whether the member is owned  by  your  Amazon
                 Web  Services  account or a different Amazon Web Services ac-
                 count.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the member. For more infor-
                 mation about ARNs and their format, see Amazon Resource Names
                 (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token that indicates the next set of results  to  re-
          trieve.
