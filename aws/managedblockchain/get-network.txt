SYNOPSIS
            get-network
          --network-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]

OPTIONS
       --network-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the network to get information about.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                     Fabric uses. For more  information,  see  Amazon  Managed

                 Attributes  of an Ethereum network for Managed Blockchain re-
                 sources participating in an Ethereum network.

                     The Ethereum CHAIN_ID associated with the  Ethereum  net-
                     work. Chain IDs are as follows:

                     o goerli = 5

                     o rinkeby = 4

          VpcEndpointServiceName -> (string)
              The VPC endpoint service name of the VPC endpoint service of the
              network. Members use the VPC endpoint service name to  create  a
              VPC endpoint to access network resources.

          VotingPolicy -> (structure)
              The  voting  rules that the network uses to decide if a proposal
              is accepted.

              ApprovalThresholdPolicy -> (structure)
                 Defines the rules for the network for  voting  on  proposals,
                 such as the percentage of YES votes required for the proposal
                 to be approved and the duration of the proposal.  The  policy
                 applies to all proposals and is specified when the network is
                 created.

                 ThresholdPercentage -> (integer)
                     The percentage of votes among all members  that  must  be
                     YES for a proposal to be approved. For example, a Thresh-
                     oldPercentage value of 50 indicates 50%.  The  Threshold-
                     Comparator   determines  the  precise  comparison.  If  a
                     ThresholdPercentage value of 50 is specified on a network
                     with  10  members, along with a ThresholdComparator value
                     of GREATER_THAN , this indicates that 6 YES votes are re-
                     quired for the proposal to be approved.

                 ProposalDurationInHours -> (integer)
                     The duration from the time that a proposal is created un-
                     til it expires. If members cast neither the required num-
                     ber  of  YES votes to approve the proposal nor the number
                     of NO votes required to reject it before the duration ex-
                     pires, the proposal is EXPIRED and ProposalActions aren't
                     carried out.

                 ThresholdComparator -> (string)
                     Determines whether the vote percentage  must  be  greater
                     than  the  ThresholdPercentage or must be greater than or
                     equal to the ThreholdPercentage to be approved.

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of the network.

          CreationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the network was created.

          Tags -> (map)
              Tags assigned to the network. Each tag consists of a key and op-
              tional value.

              For  more  information  about tags, see Tagging Resources in the
              Amazon Managed Blockchain Ethereum Developer Guide , or  Tagging
              Resources  in  the  Amazon Managed Blockchain Hyperledger Fabric
              Developer Guide .

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the network. For more informa-
              tion  about  ARNs  and  their  format, see Amazon Resource Names
              (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .
