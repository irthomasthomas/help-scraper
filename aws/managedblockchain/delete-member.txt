DELETE-MEMBER()                                                DELETE-MEMBER()



NAME
       delete-member -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a member. Deleting a member removes the member and all associ-
       ated resources from the network. DeleteMember can only be called for  a
       specified MemberId if the principal performing the action is associated
       with the Amazon Web Services account that owns the member. In all other
       cases,  the  DeleteMember action is carried out as the result of an ap-
       proved proposal to remove a member. If MemberId is the last member in a
       network  specified by the last Amazon Web Services account, the network
       is deleted also.

       Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.

OPTIONS
       --network-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the network from which the  member  is  re-
          moved.

       --member-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the member to remove.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.
