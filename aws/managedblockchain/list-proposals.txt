OPTIONS
       --network-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the network.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of proposals to return.

       --next-token (string)
          The  pagination  token that indicates the next set of results to re-
          trieve.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

              ProposalId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the proposal.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the proposal.

              ProposedByMemberId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the member  that  created  the  pro-
                 posal.

              ProposedByMemberName -> (string)

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the proposal. Values are as follows:

                 o IN_PROGRESS  -  The  proposal is active and open for member
                   voting.

                 o APPROVED - The proposal was approved  with  sufficient  YES
                   votes among members according to the VotingPolicy specified
                   for the Network . The specified proposal actions  are  car-
                   ried out.

                 o REJECTED  - The proposal was rejected with insufficient YES
                   votes among members according to the VotingPolicy specified
                   for the Network . The specified ProposalActions aren't car-
                   ried out.

                 o EXPIRED - Members didn't cast the number of votes  required
                   to  determine  the proposal outcome before the proposal ex-
                   pired. The specified ProposalActions aren't carried out.

                 o ACTION_FAILED - One or more of  the  specified  ProposalAc-
                   tions in a proposal that was approved couldn't be completed
                   because of an error.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the proposal was created.

              ExpirationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the proposal expires. This is the Cre-
                 ationDate  plus the ProposalDurationInHours that is specified
                 in the ProposalThresholdPolicy . After this date and time, if
                 members  haven't  cast  enough votes to determine the outcome
                 according to the voting policy, the proposal is  EXPIRED  and

              Arn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the proposal. For more in-
                 formation about ARNs and their format,  see  Amazon  Resource

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  pagination  token that indicates the next set of results to re-
          trieve.
