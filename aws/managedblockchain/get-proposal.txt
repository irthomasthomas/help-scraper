          --network-id <value>
          --proposal-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]

          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]

          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]

OPTIONS
       --network-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the network for which the proposal is made.

       --proposal-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the proposal.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,

                among members according to the VotingPolicy specified for  the
                Network . The specified proposal actions are carried out.

              o REJECTED  -  The  proposal  was rejected with insufficient YES
                votes among members according to  the  VotingPolicy  specified
                for  the  Network . The specified ProposalActions are not car-
                ried out.

              o EXPIRED - Members did not cast the number of votes required to
                determine  the  proposal  outcome before the proposal expired.
                The specified ProposalActions are not carried out.

              o ACTION_FAILED - One or more of the  specified  ProposalActions
                in a proposal that was approved could not be completed because

              bers have not cast enough votes to determine the outcome accord-
              ing  to  the  voting policy, the proposal is EXPIRED and Actions
