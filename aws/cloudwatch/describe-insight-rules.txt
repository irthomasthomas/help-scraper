OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          Include this value, if it was returned by the previous operation, to
          get the next set of rules.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  results to return in one operation. If you
          omit this parameter, the default of 500 is used.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If this parameter is present, it is a token that marks the start  of
          the next batch of returned results.

       InsightRules -> (list)
          The rules returned by the operation.

          (structure)
              This  structure  contains  the  definition for a Contributor In-
              sights rule. For more information  about  this  rule,  see`Using
              Constributor   Insights  to  analyze  high-cardinality  data  <-
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitor-
              ing/ContributorInsights.html>`__  in  the Amazon CloudWatch User
              Guide .

                 The name of the rule.

              State -> (string)
                 Indicates whether the rule is enabled or disabled.

              Schema -> (string)
                 For rules that you create, this is  always  {"Name":  "Cloud-
                 WatchLogRule",  "Version":  1}  .  For managed rules, this is
                 {"Name": "ServiceLogRule", "Version": 1}

              Definition -> (string)
                 The definition of the rule, as a JSON object. The  definition
                 contains  the keywords used to define contributors, the value
                 to aggregate on if this rule  returns  a  sum  instead  of  a
                 count,  and the filters. For details on the valid syntax, see
                 Contributor Insights Rule Syntax .

              ManagedRule -> (boolean)
                 An optional built-in rule that Amazon Web Services manages.
