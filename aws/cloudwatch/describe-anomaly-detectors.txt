NAME
       describe-anomaly-detectors -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  anomaly  detection models that you have created in your ac-
       count. For single metric anomaly detectors, you can  list  all  of  the
       models  in  your  account or filter the results to only the models that
       are related to a certain namespace, metric name, or  metric  dimension.
       For  metric  math  anomaly  detectors, you can list them by adding MET-
       RIC_MATH to the AnomalyDetectorTypes array. This will return all metric
       math anomaly detectors in your account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-anomaly-detectors is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: AnomalyDetectors

SYNOPSIS
            describe-anomaly-detectors
          [--namespace <value>]
          [--metric-name <value>]
          [--dimensions <value>]
          [--anomaly-detector-types <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --namespace (string)
          Limits the results to only the anomaly detection models that are as-
          sociated with the specified namespace.

       --metric-name (string)
          Limits the results to only the anomaly detection models that are as-
          sociated with the specified metric name. If there are multiple  met-
          rics with this name in different namespaces that have anomaly detec-
          tion models, they're all returned.

       --dimensions (list)
          Limits the results to only the anomaly detection models that are as-
          sociated with the specified metric dimensions. If there are multiple
          metrics that have these dimensions and have anomaly detection models
          associated, they're all returned.

          (structure)
              A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of
              a metric. Because dimensions are part of the  unique  identifier
              for  a  metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one
              of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of  that  met-
              ric.  For example, many Amazon EC2 metrics publish InstanceId as
              a dimension name, and the actual instance ID as  the  value  for
              that dimension.

              You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the dimension. Dimension names must contain only
                 ASCII characters, must include at  least  one  non-whitespace
                 character, and cannot start with a colon (: ).

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value  of  the  dimension. Dimension values must contain
                 only  ASCII  characters  and  must  include  at   least   one
                 non-whitespace character.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --anomaly-detector-types (list)
          The  anomaly detector types to request when using DescribeAnomalyDe-
          tectorsInput . If empty, defaults to SINGLE_METRIC .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            SINGLE_METRIC
            METRIC_MATH

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AnomalyDetectors -> (list)
          The list of anomaly detection models returned by the operation.

          (structure)
              An anomaly detection model associated with a  particular  Cloud-
              Watch  metric, statistic, or metric math expression. You can use
              the model to display a band of expected, normal values when  the
              metric is graphed.

              Namespace -> (string)
                 The  namespace  of the metric associated with the anomaly de-
                 tection model.

              MetricName -> (string)
                 The name of the metric associated with the anomaly  detection
                 model.

              Dimensions -> (list)
                 The  metric  dimensions associated with the anomaly detection
                 model.

                 (structure)
                     A dimension is a name/value pair  that  is  part  of  the
                     identity  of a metric. Because dimensions are part of the
                     unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique
                     name/value  pair to one of your metrics, you are creating
                     a new variation of that metric. For example, many  Amazon
                     EC2  metrics  publish InstanceId as a dimension name, and
                     the actual instance ID as the value for that dimension.

                     You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the dimension. Dimension names  must  con-
                        tain  only ASCII characters, must include at least one
                        non-whitespace character,  and  cannot  start  with  a
                        colon (: ).

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the dimension. Dimension values must con-
                        tain only ASCII characters and must include  at  least
                        one non-whitespace character.

              Stat -> (string)
                 The statistic associated with the anomaly detection model.

              Configuration -> (structure)
                 The configuration specifies details about how the anomaly de-
                 tection model is to be trained, including time ranges to  ex-
                 clude  from  use for training the model, and the time zone to
                 use for the metric.

                 ExcludedTimeRanges -> (list)
                     An array of time ranges to  exclude  from  use  when  the
                     anomaly detection model is trained. Use this to make sure
                     that events that could cause unusual values for the  met-
                     ric,  such  as  deployments,  aren't used when CloudWatch
                     creates the model.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies one range of days or times to  exclude  from
                        use for training an anomaly detection model.

                        StartTime -> (timestamp)
                            The start time of the range to exclude. The format
                            is   yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss    .    For    example,
                            2019-07-01T23:59:59 .

                        EndTime -> (timestamp)
                            The  end  time of the range to exclude. The format
                            is   yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss    .    For    example,
                            2019-07-01T23:59:59 .

                 MetricTimezone -> (string)
                     The  time  zone  to use for the metric. This is useful to
                     enable the model to automatically  account  for  daylight
                     savings  time  changes if the metric is sensitive to such
                     time changes.

                     To specify a time zone, use the name of the time zone  as
                     specified  in the standard tz database. For more informa-
                     tion, see tz database .

              StateValue -> (string)
                 The current status of the anomaly  detector's  training.  The
                 possible  values are TRAINED | PENDING_TRAINING | TRAINED_IN-
                 SUFFICIENT_DATA

              SingleMetricAnomalyDetector -> (structure)
                 The CloudWatch metric and statistic for this  anomaly  detec-
                 tor.

                 Namespace -> (string)
                     The  namespace of the metric to create the anomaly detec-
                     tion model for.

                 MetricName -> (string)
                     The name of the metric to create  the  anomaly  detection
                     model for.

                 Dimensions -> (list)
                     The  metric  dimensions  to  create the anomaly detection
                     model for.

                     (structure)
                        A dimension is a name/value pair that is part  of  the
                        identity  of  a metric. Because dimensions are part of
                        the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a
                        unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are
                        creating a new variation of that metric. For  example,
                        many Amazon EC2 metrics publish InstanceId as a dimen-
                        sion name, and the actual instance ID as the value for
                        that dimension.

                        You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.

                        Name -> (string)
                            The  name  of  the dimension. Dimension names must
                            contain only ASCII  characters,  must  include  at
                            least  one  non-whitespace  character,  and cannot
                            start with a colon (: ).

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value of the dimension. Dimension values  must
                            contain  only ASCII characters and must include at
                            least one non-whitespace character.

                 Stat -> (string)
                     The statistic to use for the metric and anomaly detection
                     model.

              MetricMathAnomalyDetector -> (structure)
                 The CloudWatch metric math expression for this anomaly detec-
                 tor.

                 MetricDataQueries -> (list)
                     An array of metric data query structures that enables you
                     to  create  an  anomaly detector based on the result of a
                     metric math expression. Each  item  in  MetricDataQueries
                     gets  a metric or performs a math expression. One item in
                     MetricDataQueries is the  expression  that  provides  the
                     time series that the anomaly detector uses as input. Des-
                     ignate the expression by setting ReturnData to  True  for
                     this  object  in the array. For all other expressions and
                     metrics, set ReturnData to False . The designated expres-
                     sion must return a single time series.

                     (structure)
                        This  structure is used in both GetMetricData and Put-
                        MetricAlarm . The supported use of this  structure  is
                        different for those two operations.

                        When  used  in GetMetricData , it indicates the metric
                        data to return, and whether this call is just retriev-
                        ing a batch set of data for one metric, or is perform-
                        ing a Metrics Insights query or a math  expression.  A
                        single  GetMetricData  call can include up to 500 Met-
                        ricDataQuery structures.

                        When used in PutMetricAlarm , it enables you to create
                        an  alarm based on a metric math expression. Each Met-
                        ricDataQuery in the array specifies either a metric to
                        retrieve,  or a math expression to be performed on re-
                        trieved metrics. A single PutMetricAlarm call can  in-
                        clude  up  to 20 MetricDataQuery structures in the ar-
                        ray. The 20 structures  can  include  as  many  as  10
                        structures  that contain a MetricStat parameter to re-
                        trieve a metric, and as many  as  10  structures  that
                        contain the Expression parameter to perform a math ex-
                        pression. Of those  Expression  structures,  one  must
                        have  True as the value for ReturnData . The result of
                        this expression is the value the alarm watches.

                        Any expression used in a PutMetricAlarm operation must
                        return a single time series. For more information, see
                        Metric Math Syntax and Functions in the Amazon  Cloud-
                        Watch User Guide .

                        Some  of  the  parameters  of this structure also have
                        different uses whether you are using this structure in
                        a  GetMetricData  operation or a PutMetricAlarm opera-
                        tion. These differences are explained in the following
                        parameter list.

                        Id -> (string)
                            A  short  name  used to tie this object to the re-
                            sults in the response. This name  must  be  unique
                            within a single call to GetMetricData . If you are
                            performing math expressions on this set  of  data,
                            this  name represents that data and can serve as a
                            variable in the mathematical expression. The valid
                            characters  are  letters, numbers, and underscore.
                            The first character must be a lowercase letter.

                        MetricStat -> (structure)
                            The metric to be returned, along with  statistics,
                            period, and units. Use this parameter only if this
                            object is retrieving a metric and not performing a
                            math expression on returned data.

                            Within  one MetricDataQuery object, you must spec-
                            ify either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                            Metric -> (structure)
                               The metric  to  return,  including  the  metric
                               name, namespace, and dimensions.

                               Namespace -> (string)
                                   The namespace of the metric.

                               MetricName -> (string)
                                   The  name of the metric. This is a required
                                   field.

                               Dimensions -> (list)
                                   The dimensions for the metric.

                                   (structure)
                                      A dimension is a name/value pair that is
                                      part  of  the  identity of a metric. Be-
                                      cause dimensions are part of the  unique
                                      identifier  for  a  metric, whenever you
                                      add a unique name/value pair to  one  of
                                      your  metrics,  you  are  creating a new
                                      variation of that metric.  For  example,
                                      many  Amazon EC2 metrics publish Instan-
                                      ceId as a dimension name, and the actual
                                      instance ID as the value for that dimen-
                                      sion.

                                      You can assign up to 30 dimensions to  a
                                      metric.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the dimension. Dimension
                                          names must contain only ASCII  char-
                                          acters,  must  include  at least one
                                          non-whitespace character, and cannot
                                          start with a colon (: ).

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          The  value  of the dimension. Dimen-
                                          sion values must contain only  ASCII
                                          characters and must include at least
                                          one non-whitespace character.

                            Period -> (integer)
                               The granularity, in seconds,  of  the  returned
                               data  points.  For metrics with regular resolu-
                               tion, a period can be as short  as  one  minute
                               (60  seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For
                               high-resolution metrics that are  collected  at
                               intervals  of  less than one minute, the period
                               can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60.
                               High-resolution   metrics   are  those  metrics
                               stored by a PutMetricData call that includes  a
                               StorageResolution of 1 second.

                               If  the  StartTime  parameter  specifies a time
                               stamp that is greater than  3  hours  ago,  you
                               must  specify  the period as follows or no data
                               points in that time range is returned:

                               o Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago  -
                                 Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).

                               o Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a
                                 multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).

                               o Start time greater than 63 days ago -  Use  a
                                 multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).

                            Stat -> (string)
                               The  statistic  to  return.  It can include any
                               CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic.

                            Unit -> (string)
                               When you are using a Put  operation,  this  de-
                               fines  what  unit  you want to use when storing
                               the metric.

                               In a Get operation, if you omit Unit  then  all
                               data  that  was  collected with any unit is re-
                               turned, along with the corresponding units that
                               were  specified  when  the data was reported to
                               CloudWatch. If you specify a unit,  the  opera-
                               tion  returns only data that was collected with
                               that unit specified. If you specify a unit that
                               does  not match the data collected, the results
                               of the operation are null. CloudWatch does  not
                               perform unit conversions.

                        Expression -> (string)
                            This  field  can contain either a Metrics Insights
                            query, or a metric math expression to be performed
                            on  the  returned data. For more information about
                            Metrics Insights  queries,  see  Metrics  Insights
                            query  components  and syntax in the Amazon Cloud-
                            Watch User Guide .

                            A math expression can use the Id of the other met-
                            rics or queries to refer to those metrics, and can
                            also use the Id of other expressions  to  use  the
                            result  of those expressions. For more information
                            about metric math  expressions,  see  Metric  Math
                            Syntax and Functions in the Amazon CloudWatch User
                            Guide .

                            Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must spec-
                            ify either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                        Label -> (string)
                            A  human-readable label for this metric or expres-
                            sion. This is especially useful if this is an  ex-
                            pression,  so  that you know what the value repre-
                            sents. If the metric or expression is shown  in  a
                            CloudWatch  dashboard  widget, the label is shown.
                            If Label is omitted, CloudWatch  generates  a  de-
                            fault.

                            You  can  put dynamic expressions into a label, so
                            that it is more descriptive. For more information,
                            see Using Dynamic Labels .

                        ReturnData -> (boolean)
                            When used in GetMetricData , this option indicates
                            whether to return the timestamps and raw data val-
                            ues  of  this  metric.  If you are performing this
                            call just to do math expressions and do  not  also
                            need  the raw data returned, you can specify False
                            . If you omit this, the default of True is used.

                            When used in PutMetricAlarm , specify True for the
                            one expression result to use as the alarm. For all
                            other metrics and expressions in the same  PutMet-
                            ricAlarm operation, specify ReturnData as False.

                        Period -> (integer)
                            The  granularity, in seconds, of the returned data
                            points. For metrics with regular resolution, a pe-
                            riod  can  be  as short as one minute (60 seconds)
                            and must be a multiple of 60. For  high-resolution
                            metrics  that  are  collected at intervals of less
                            than one minute, the period can be 1, 5,  10,  30,
                            60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics
                            are those metrics stored by a PutMetricData opera-
                            tion that includes a StorageResolution of 1 second
                            .

                        AccountId -> (string)
                            The ID of the account where the  metrics  are  lo-
                            cated, if this is a cross-account alarm.

                            Use this field only for PutMetricAlarm operations.
                            It is not used in GetMetricData operations.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that you can use in a subsequent operation to  retrieve  the
          next set of results.
