PUT-METRIC-STREAM()                                        PUT-METRIC-STREAM()



NAME
       put-metric-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or  updates  a metric stream. Metric streams can automatically
       stream CloudWatch metrics to Amazon Web Services destinations including
       Amazon S3 and to many third-party solutions.

       For more information, see Using Metric Streams .

       To create a metric stream, you must be logged on to an account that has
       the iam:PassRole permission and either the CloudWatchFullAccess  policy
       or the cloudwatch:PutMetricStream permission.

       When  you  create or update a metric stream, you choose one of the fol-
       lowing:

       o Stream metrics from all metric namespaces in the account.

       o Stream metrics from all metric namespaces in the account, except  for
         the namespaces that you list in ExcludeFilters .

       o Stream  metrics  from only the metric namespaces that you list in In-
         cludeFilters .

       By default, a metric stream always sends the MAX , MIN , SUM , and SAM-
       PLECOUNT  statistics  for each metric that is streamed. You can use the
       StatisticsConfigurations parameter to have the metric stream also  send
       additional  statistics  in  the stream. Streaming additional statistics
       incurs additional costs. For more information,  see  Amazon  CloudWatch
       Pricing .

       When  you use PutMetricStream to create a new metric stream, the stream
       is created in the running state. If you use it to  update  an  existing
       stream, the state of the stream is not changed.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          If  you  are  creating a new metric stream, this is the name for the
          new stream. The name must be different than the names of other  met-
          ric streams in this account and Region.

          If you are updating a metric stream, specify the name of that stream
          here.

          Valid characters are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, "-" and "_".

       --include-filters (list)
          If you specify this parameter, the stream  sends  only  the  metrics
          from the metric namespaces that you specify here.

          You cannot include IncludeFilters and ExcludeFilters in the same op-
          eration.

          (structure)
              This structure contains the name of one of the metric namespaces
              that is listed in a filter of a metric stream.

              Namespace -> (string)
                 The name of the metric namespace in the filter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Namespace=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Namespace": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --exclude-filters (list)
          If  you  specify  this  parameter, the stream sends metrics from all
          metric namespaces except for the namespaces that you specify here.

          You cannot include ExcludeFilters and IncludeFilters in the same op-
          eration.

          (structure)
              This structure contains the name of one of the metric namespaces
              that is listed in a filter of a metric stream.

              Namespace -> (string)
                 The name of the metric namespace in the filter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Namespace=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Namespace": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --firehose-arn (string)
          The ARN of the Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream  to  use  for
          this  metric  stream.  This  Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream
          must already exist and must be in the same  account  as  the  metric
          stream.

       --role-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of  an IAM role that this metric stream will use to access
          Amazon Kinesis Firehose resources. This IAM role must already  exist
          and  must be in the same account as the metric stream. This IAM role
          must include the following permissions:

          o firehose:PutRecord

          o firehose:PutRecordBatch

       --output-format (string)
          The output format for the stream. Valid values are  json  and  open-
          telemetry0.7  . For more information about metric stream output for-
          mats, see Metric streams output formats .

          Possible values:

          o json

          o opentelemetry0.7

       --tags (list)
          A list of key-value pairs to associate with the metric  stream.  You
          can associate as many as 50 tags with a metric stream.

          Tags  can  help  you organize and categorize your resources. You can
          also use them to scope user permissions by granting a  user  permis-
          sion to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

          You  can  use this parameter only when you are creating a new metric
          stream. If you are using this operation to update an existing metric
          stream,  any  tags  you  specify  in  this parameter are ignored. To
          change the tags of an existing metric  stream,  use  TagResource  or
          UntagResource .

          (structure)
              A key-value pair associated with a CloudWatch resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  string that you can use to assign a value. The combination
                 of tag keys and values can help you organize  and  categorize
                 your resources.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the specified tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

            }
            ...
          ]

       --statistics-configurations (list)
          By  default,  a metric stream always sends the MAX , MIN , SUM , and
          SAMPLECOUNT statistics for each metric that is streamed. You can use
          this  parameter  to have the metric stream also send additional sta-
          tistics in the stream. This array can have up to 100 members.

          For each entry in this array, you specify one or  more  metrics  and
          the  list  of additional statistics to stream for those metrics. The
          additional statistics that you can stream  depend  on  the  stream's
          OutputFormat  . If the OutputFormat is json , you can stream any ad-
          ditional statistic  that  is  supported  by  CloudWatch,  listed  in
          CloudWatch  statistics  definitions  .  If the OutputFormat is open-
          telemetry0.7 , you can stream percentile  statistics  such  as  p95,
          p99.9 and so on.

          (structure)
              By  default,  a metric stream always sends the MAX , MIN , SUM ,
              and SAMPLECOUNT statistics for each  metric  that  is  streamed.
              This structure contains information for one metric that includes
              additional statistics in the stream. For more information  about
              statistics, see CloudWatch, listed in CloudWatch statistics def-
              initions .

                 An array of metric name and namespace pairs that  stream  the
                 additional  statistics listed in the value of the Additional-
                 Statistics parameter. There can be as many as  100  pairs  in
                 the array.

                 All  metrics  that  match  the combination of metric name and
                 namespace will be streamed with the additional statistics, no
                 matter their dimensions.

                 (structure)
                     This  object contains the information for one metric that
                     is to be streamed with additional statistics.

                     Namespace -> (string)
                        The namespace of the metric.

                     MetricName -> (string)
                        The name of the metric.

              AdditionalStatistics -> (list)
                 The list of additional statistics that are to be streamed for
                 the metrics listed in the IncludeMetrics array in this struc-
                 ture. This list can include as many as 20 statistics.

                 If the OutputFormat for the stream is opentelemetry0.7 ,  the
                 only  valid values are p*??* `` percentile statistics such as
                 ``p90 , p99 and so on.

                 If the OutputFormat for the stream is json , the valid values
                 include the abbreviations for all of the statistics listed in
                 CloudWatch statistics definitions .  For  example,  this  in-
                 cludes tm98,  wm90 , PR(:300) , and so on.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          IncludeMetrics=[{Namespace=string,MetricName=string},{Namespace=string,MetricName=string}],AdditionalStatistics=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [

            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
