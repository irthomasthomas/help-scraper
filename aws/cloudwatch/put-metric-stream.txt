PUT-METRIC-STREAM()                                        PUT-METRIC-STREAM()



NAME
       put-metric-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or  updates  a metric stream. Metric streams can automatically
       stream CloudWatch metrics to Amazon Web Services destinations,  includ-
       ing Amazon S3, and to many third-party solutions.

       For more information, see Using Metric Streams .

       To create a metric stream, you must be signed in to an account that has
       the iam:PassRole permission and either the CloudWatchFullAccess  policy
       or the cloudwatch:PutMetricStream permission.

       When  you  create or update a metric stream, you choose one of the fol-
       lowing:

       o Stream metrics from all metric namespaces in the account.

       o Stream metrics from all metric namespaces in the account, except  for
         the namespaces that you list in ExcludeFilters .

       o Stream  metrics  from only the metric namespaces that you list in In-
         cludeFilters .

       By default, a metric stream always sends the MAX , MIN , SUM , and SAM-
       PLECOUNT  statistics  for each metric that is streamed. You can use the
       StatisticsConfigurations parameter to have the metric stream send addi-
       tional statistics in the stream. Streaming additional statistics incurs
       additional costs. For more information, see Amazon CloudWatch Pricing .

       When you use PutMetricStream to create a new metric stream, the  stream
       is  created  in  the running state. If you use it to update an existing
       stream, the state of the stream is not changed.

       If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability and you  create
       a  metric stream in a monitoring account, you can choose whether to in-
       clude metrics from source accounts in the stream. For more information,
       see CloudWatch cross-account observability .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          If  you  are  creating a new metric stream, this is the name for the
          new stream. The name must be different than the names of other  met-
          ric streams in this account and Region.

          If you are updating a metric stream, specify the name of that stream
          here.

          Valid characters are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, "-" and "_".

       --include-filters (list)
          If you specify this parameter, the stream  sends  only  the  metrics
          from the metric namespaces that you specify here.

          You cannot include IncludeFilters and ExcludeFilters in the same op-
          eration.

          (structure)
              This structure contains a metric  namespace  and  optionally,  a
              list  of  metric  names, to either include in a metric stream or
              exclude from a metric stream.

              A metric stream's filters can include up to  1000  total  names.
              This  limit  applies  to  the  sum of namespace names and metric
              names in the filters. For example, this could include 10  metric
              namespace  filters with 99 metrics each, or 20 namespace filters
              with 49 metrics specified in each filter.

              Namespace -> (string)
                 The name of the metric namespace for this filter.

                 The namespace can contain  only  ASCII  printable  characters
                 (ASCII  range  32  through 126). It must contain at least one
                 non-whitespace character.

              MetricNames -> (list)
                 The names of the metrics to either include  or  exclude  from
                 the metric stream.

                 If  you omit this parameter, all metrics in the namespace are
                 included or excluded, depending on  whether  this  filter  is
                 specified as an exclude filter or an include filter.

                 Each  metric name can contain only ASCII printable characters
                 (ASCII range 32 through 126). Each metric name  must  contain
                 at least one non-whitespace character.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Namespace=string,MetricNames=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Namespace": "string",
              "MetricNames": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --exclude-filters (list)
          If  you  specify  this  parameter, the stream sends metrics from all
          metric namespaces except for the namespaces that you specify here.

          You cannot include ExcludeFilters and IncludeFilters in the same op-
          eration.

          (structure)
              This  structure  contains  a  metric namespace and optionally, a
              list of metric names, to either include in a  metric  stream  or
              exclude from a metric stream.

              A  metric  stream's  filters can include up to 1000 total names.
              This limit applies to the sum  of  namespace  names  and  metric
              names  in the filters. For example, this could include 10 metric
              namespace filters with 99 metrics each, or 20 namespace  filters
              with 49 metrics specified in each filter.

              Namespace -> (string)
                 The name of the metric namespace for this filter.

                 The  namespace  can  contain  only ASCII printable characters
                 (ASCII range 32 through 126). It must contain  at  least  one
                 non-whitespace character.

              MetricNames -> (list)
                 The  names  of  the metrics to either include or exclude from
                 the metric stream.

                 If you omit this parameter, all metrics in the namespace  are
                 included  or  excluded,  depending  on whether this filter is
                 specified as an exclude filter or an include filter.

                 Each metric name can contain only ASCII printable  characters
                 (ASCII  range  32 through 126). Each metric name must contain
                 at least one non-whitespace character.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Namespace=string,MetricNames=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Namespace": "string",
              "MetricNames": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --firehose-arn (string)
          The ARN of the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream  to  use
          for  this  metric stream. This Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery
          stream must already exist and must be in the  same  account  as  the
          metric stream.

       --role-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of  an IAM role that this metric stream will use to access
          Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose resources. This IAM role  must  already
          exist and must be in the same account as the metric stream. This IAM
          role must include the following permissions:

          o firehose:PutRecord

          o firehose:PutRecordBatch

       --output-format (string)
          The output format for the stream. Valid  values  are  json  ,  open-
          telemetry1.0  ,  and  opentelemetry0.7  . For more information about
          metric stream output formats, see Metric streams output formats .

          Possible values:

          o json

          o opentelemetry0.7

          o opentelemetry1.0

       --tags (list)
          A list of key-value pairs to associate with the metric  stream.  You
          can associate as many as 50 tags with a metric stream.

          Tags  can  help  you organize and categorize your resources. You can
          also use them to scope user permissions by granting a  user  permis-
          sion to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

          You  can  use this parameter only when you are creating a new metric
          stream. If you are using this operation to update an existing metric
          stream,  any  tags  you  specify  in  this parameter are ignored. To
          change the tags of an existing metric  stream,  use  TagResource  or
          UntagResource .

          (structure)
              A key-value pair associated with a CloudWatch resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  string that you can use to assign a value. The combination
                 of tag keys and values can help you organize  and  categorize
                 your resources.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the specified tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --statistics-configurations (list)
          By  default,  a metric stream always sends the MAX , MIN , SUM , and
          SAMPLECOUNT statistics for each metric that is streamed. You can use
          this  parameter  to have the metric stream also send additional sta-
          tistics in the stream. This array can have up to 100 members.

          For each entry in this array, you specify one or  more  metrics  and
          the  list  of additional statistics to stream for those metrics. The
          additional statistics that you can stream  depend  on  the  stream's
          OutputFormat  . If the OutputFormat is json , you can stream any ad-
          ditional statistic  that  is  supported  by  CloudWatch,  listed  in
          CloudWatch  statistics  definitions  .  If the OutputFormat is open-
          telemetry1.0 or opentelemetry0.7 , you can stream percentile statis-
          tics such as p95, p99.9, and so on.

          (structure)
              By  default,  a metric stream always sends the MAX , MIN , SUM ,
              and SAMPLECOUNT statistics for each  metric  that  is  streamed.
              This structure contains information for one metric that includes
              additional statistics in the stream. For more information  about
              statistics, see CloudWatch, listed in CloudWatch statistics def-
              initions .

              IncludeMetrics -> (list)
                 An array of metric name and namespace pairs that  stream  the
                 additional  statistics listed in the value of the Additional-
                 Statistics parameter. There can be as many as  100  pairs  in
                 the array.

                 All  metrics  that  match  the combination of metric name and
                 namespace will be streamed with the additional statistics, no
                 matter their dimensions.

                 (structure)
                     This  object contains the information for one metric that
                     is to be streamed with additional statistics.

                     Namespace -> (string)
                        The namespace of the metric.

                     MetricName -> (string)
                        The name of the metric.

              AdditionalStatistics -> (list)
                 The list of additional statistics that are to be streamed for
                 the metrics listed in the IncludeMetrics array in this struc-
                 ture. This list can include as many as 20 statistics.

                 If the OutputFormat for the  stream  is  opentelemetry1.0  or
                 opentelemetry0.7  ,  the  only valid values are p*??* `` per-
                 centile statistics such as ``p90 , p99 and so on.

                 If the OutputFormat for the stream is json , the valid values
                 include the abbreviations for all of the statistics listed in
                 CloudWatch statistics definitions .  For  example,  this  in-
                 cludes tm98,  wm90 , PR(:300) , and so on.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          IncludeMetrics=[{Namespace=string,MetricName=string},{Namespace=string,MetricName=string}],AdditionalStatistics=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

              "AdditionalStatistics": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --include-linked-accounts-metrics  |  --no-include-linked-accounts-met-
       rics (boolean)
          If you are creating a metric stream in a monitoring account, specify
          true to include metrics from source accounts in the metric stream.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
