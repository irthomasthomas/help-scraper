PUT-MANAGED-INSIGHT-RULES()                        PUT-MANAGED-INSIGHT-RULES()



NAME
       put-managed-insight-rules -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a managed Contributor Insights rule for a specified Amazon Web
       Services resource. When you enable a managed rule, you  create  a  Con-
       tributor Insights rule that collects data from Amazon Web Services ser-
       vices. You cannot edit these rules with PutInsightRule . The rules  can
       be enabled, disabled, and deleted using EnableInsightRules , DisableIn-
       sightRules , and DeleteInsightRules . If a previously  created  managed
       rule  is  currently disabled, a subsequent call to this API will re-en-
       able it. Use ListManagedInsightRules to describe all available rules.

OPTIONS
       --managed-rules (list)
          A list of ManagedRules to enable.

          (structure)
              Contains the information that's required  to  enable  a  managed
              Contributor Insights rule for an Amazon Web Services resource.

              TemplateName -> (string)
                 The  template name for the managed Contributor Insights rule,
                 as returned by ListManagedInsightRules .

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of an Amazon Web Services resource that  has  managed
                 Contributor Insights rules.

              Tags -> (list)
                 A  list of key-value pairs that you can associate with a man-
                 aged Contributor Insights rule. You can associate as many  as
                 50  tags  with a rule. Tags can help you organize and catego-
                 rize your resources. You also can use them to scope user per-
                 missions  by  granting  a user permission to access or change
                 only the resources that have certain tag values. To associate
                 tags  with  a  rule, you must have the cloudwatch:TagResource
                 permission in addition to the cloudwatch:PutInsightRule  per-
                 mission.  If you are using this operation to update an exist-
                 ing Contributor Insights rule, any tags that you  specify  in
                 this parameter are ignored. To change the tags of an existing
                 rule, use TagResource .

                 (structure)
                     A key-value pair associated with a CloudWatch resource.

                     Key -> (string)
                        A string that you can use to assign a value. The  com-
                        bination  of tag keys and values can help you organize
                        and categorize your resources.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value for the specified tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TemplateName=string,ResourceARN=string,Tags=[{Key=string,Value=string},{Key=string,Value=string}] ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "TemplateName": "string",
              "ResourceARN": "string",
              "Tags": [
                {
                  "Key": "string",
                  "Value": "string"
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       Failures -> (list)
          An array that lists the rules that could not be enabled.

          (structure)
              This  array is empty if the API operation was successful for all
              the rules specified in the request. If the operation  could  not
