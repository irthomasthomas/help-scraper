OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the metric stream to retrieve information about.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The ARN of the metric stream.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the metric stream.

       IncludeFilters -> (list)
          If this array of metric namespaces is present, then these namespaces
          are  the  only  metric  namespaces  that are streamed by this metric
          stream.

          (structure)
              This structure contains a metric  namespace  and  optionally,  a
              list  of  metric  names, to either include in a metric stream or
              exclude from a metric stream.

              A metric stream's filters can include up to  1000  total  names.
              This  limit  applies  to  the  sum of namespace names and metric
              names in the filters. For example, this could include 10  metric
              namespace  filters with 99 metrics each, or 20 namespace filters
              with 49 metrics specified in each filter.

              Namespace -> (string)
                 The name of the metric namespace for this filter.

                 The namespace can contain  only  ASCII  printable  characters
                 (ASCII  range  32  through 126). It must contain at least one
                 non-whitespace character.

              MetricNames -> (list)
                 The names of the metrics to either include  or  exclude  from
                 the metric stream.

                 If  you omit this parameter, all metrics in the namespace are
                 included or excluded, depending on  whether  this  filter  is
                 specified as an exclude filter or an include filter.

                 Each  metric name can contain only ASCII printable characters
                 (ASCII range 32 through 126). Each metric name  must  contain
                 at least one non-whitespace character.

                 (string)

       ExcludeFilters -> (list)
          If this array of metric namespaces is present, then these namespaces
          are the only metric namespaces that are not streamed by this  metric
          stream. In this case, all other metric namespaces in the account are
          streamed by this metric stream.

          (structure)
              This structure contains a metric  namespace  and  optionally,  a
              list  of  metric  names, to either include in a metric stream or
              exclude from a metric stream.

              A metric stream's filters can include up to  1000  total  names.
              This  limit  applies  to  the  sum of namespace names and metric
              names in the filters. For example, this could include 10  metric
              namespace  filters with 99 metrics each, or 20 namespace filters
              with 49 metrics specified in each filter.

              Namespace -> (string)
                 The name of the metric namespace for this filter.

                 The namespace can contain  only  ASCII  printable  characters
                 (ASCII  range  32  through 126). It must contain at least one
                 non-whitespace character.

              MetricNames -> (list)
                 The names of the metrics to either include  or  exclude  from
                 the metric stream.

                 If  you omit this parameter, all metrics in the namespace are
                 included or excluded, depending on  whether  this  filter  is
                 specified as an exclude filter or an include filter.

                 Each  metric name can contain only ASCII printable characters
                 (ASCII range 32 through 126). Each metric name  must  contain
                 at least one non-whitespace character.

                 (string)

       FirehoseArn -> (string)

          The ARN of the IAM role that is used by this metric stream.

       State -> (string)
          The state of the metric stream. The possible values are running  and
          stopped .

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date that the metric stream was created.

       LastUpdateDate -> (timestamp)
          The date of the most recent update to the metric stream's configura-
          tion.

       OutputFormat -> (string)
          The output format for the stream. Valid  values  are  json  ,  open-
          telemetry1.0  ,  and  opentelemetry0.7  . For more information about
          metric stream output formats, see Metric streams output formats .

       StatisticsConfigurations -> (list)
          Each entry in this array displays information about one or more met-
          rics  that  include  additional statistics in the metric stream. For
          more information about the  additional  statistics,  see  CloudWatch
          statistics definitions .

          (structure)
              By  default,  a metric stream always sends the MAX , MIN , SUM ,
              and SAMPLECOUNT statistics for each  metric  that  is  streamed.
              This structure contains information for one metric that includes
              additional statistics in the stream. For more information  about
              statistics, see CloudWatch, listed in CloudWatch statistics def-
              initions .

              IncludeMetrics -> (list)
                 An array of metric name and namespace pairs that  stream  the
                 additional  statistics listed in the value of the Additional-
                 Statistics parameter. There can be as many as  100  pairs  in
                 the array.

                 All  metrics  that  match  the combination of metric name and
                 namespace will be streamed with the additional statistics, no
                 matter their dimensions.

                 (structure)
                     This  object contains the information for one metric that
                     is to be streamed with additional statistics.

                     Namespace -> (string)
                        The namespace of the metric.

                     MetricName -> (string)

              AdditionalStatistics -> (list)
                 The list of additional statistics that are to be streamed for
                 the metrics listed in the IncludeMetrics array in this struc-
                 ture. This list can include as many as 20 statistics.

                 If the OutputFormat for the  stream  is  opentelemetry1.0  or
                 opentelemetry0.7  ,  the  only valid values are p*??* `` per-
                 centile statistics such as ``p90 , p99 and so on.

                 If the OutputFormat for the stream is json , the valid values
                 include the abbreviations for all of the statistics listed in
                 CloudWatch statistics definitions .  For  example,  this  in-
                 cludes tm98,  wm90 , PR(:300) , and so on.

                 (string)

       IncludeLinkedAccountsMetrics -> (boolean)
          If  this  is true and this metric stream is in a monitoring account,
