GET-METRIC-STREAM()                                        GET-METRIC-STREAM()



NAME
       get-metric-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about the metric stream that you specify.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-metric-stream
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the metric stream to retrieve information about.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The ARN of the metric stream.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the metric stream.

       IncludeFilters -> (list)
          If this array of metric namespaces is present, then these namespaces
          are  the  only  metric  namespaces  that are streamed by this metric
          stream.

          (structure)
              This structure contains the name of one of the metric namespaces
              that is listed in a filter of a metric stream.

              Namespace -> (string)
                 The name of the metric namespace in the filter.

       ExcludeFilters -> (list)
          If this array of metric namespaces is present, then these namespaces
          are the only metric namespaces that are not streamed by this  metric
          stream. In this case, all other metric namespaces in the account are
          streamed by this metric stream.

          (structure)
              This structure contains the name of one of the metric namespaces
              that is listed in a filter of a metric stream.

              Namespace -> (string)
                 The name of the metric namespace in the filter.

       FirehoseArn -> (string)
          The  ARN of the Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream that is used
          by this metric stream.

       RoleArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the IAM role that is used by this metric stream.

       State -> (string)
          The state of the metric stream. The possible values are running  and
          stopped .

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date that the metric stream was created.

       LastUpdateDate -> (timestamp)
          The date of the most recent update to the metric stream's configura-
          tion.

       OutputFormat -> (string)
          The output format for the stream. Valid values are  json  and  open-
          telemetry0.7  . For more information about metric stream output for-
          mats, see Metric streams output formats .

       StatisticsConfigurations -> (list)
          Each entry in this array displays information about one or more met-
          rics that include extended statistics in the metric stream. For more
          information about extended  statistics,  see  CloudWatch  statistics
          definitions .

          (structure)
              By  default,  a metric stream always sends the MAX , MIN , SUM ,
              and SAMPLECOUNT statistics for each  metric  that  is  streamed.
              This structure contains information for one metric that includes
              extended statistics in the stream. For  more  information  about
              extended  statistics,  see CloudWatch, listed in CloudWatch sta-
              tistics definitions .

              IncludeMetrics -> (list)
                 An array of metric name and namespace pairs that  stream  the
                 extended  statistics  listed  in the value of the Additional-
                 Statistics parameter. There can be as many as  100  pairs  in
                 the array.

                 All  metrics  that  match  the combination of metric name and
                 namespace will be streamed with the extended  statistics,  no
                 matter their dimensions.

                 (structure)
                     This  object contains the information for one metric that
                     is to streamed with extended statistics.

                     Namespace -> (string)
                        The metric namespace for the metric.

                     MetricName -> (string)
                        The name of the metric.

              AdditionalStatistics -> (list)
                 The list of extended statistics that are to be  streamed  for
                 the metrics listed in the IncludeMetrics array in this struc-
                 ture. This list can include as many as 20 statistics.

                 If the OutputFormat for the stream is opentelemetry0.7 ,  the
                 only  valid values are p*??* `` percentile statistics such as
                 ``p90 , p99 and so on.

                 If the OutputFormat for the stream is json , the valid values
                 are include the abbreviations for all of the extended statis-
                 tics listed in CloudWatch statistics definitions . For  exam-
                 ple, this includes tm98,  wm90 , PR(:300) , and so on.
