       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-managed-insight-rules
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The ARN of an Amazon Web Services resource that has managed Contrib-
          utor Insights rules.

       --next-token (string)
          Include this value to get the next set of rules if the value was re-
          turned by the previous operation.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in  one  operation.  If  you
          omit  this parameter, the default number is used. The default number
          is 100 .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
