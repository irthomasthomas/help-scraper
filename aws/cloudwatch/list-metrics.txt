LIST-METRICS()                                                  LIST-METRICS()



NAME
       list-metrics -

DESCRIPTION
       List  the  specified  metrics.  You  can  use the returned metrics with
       GetMetricData or GetMetricStatistics to get statistical data.

       Up to 500 results are returned for any one call. To retrieve additional
       results, use the returned token with subsequent calls.

       After you create a metric, allow up to 15 minutes for the metric to ap-
       pear.  To  see  metric  statistics   sooner,   use   GetMetricData   or
       GetMetricStatistics .

       If  you  are  using CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can use
       this operation in a monitoring account and view metrics from the linked
       source accounts. For more information, see CloudWatch cross-account ob-
       servability .
          ListMetrics doesn't return information about metrics if  those  met-
          rics  haven't reported data in the past two weeks. To retrieve those
          metrics, use GetMetricData or GetMetricStatistics .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-metrics is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: Metrics, OwningAccounts

OPTIONS
       --namespace (string)
          The  metric  namespace  to  filter  against. Only the namespace that
          matches exactly will be returned.

       --metric-name (string)
          The name of the metric to filter  against.  Only  the  metrics  with
          names that match exactly will be returned.

       --dimensions (list)
          The dimensions to filter against. Only the dimensions that match ex-
          actly will be returned.

          (structure)
              Represents filters for a dimension.

              Name -> (string)
                 The dimension name to be matched.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the dimension to be matched.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --recently-active (string)
          To filter the results to show only metrics that have had data points
          published  in  the  past  three hours, specify this parameter with a
          value of PT3H . This is the only valid value for this parameter.

          The results that are returned are an approximation of the value  you
          specify.  There  is  a low probability that the returned results in-
          clude metrics with last published data as much as  40  minutes  more
          than the specified time interval.

          Possible values:

          o PT3H

       --include-linked-accounts | --no-include-linked-accounts (boolean)
          If  you  are  using  this operation in a monitoring account, specify
          true to include metrics from source accounts in the returned data.

          The default is false .

       --owning-account (string)
          When you use this operation in a monitoring account, use this  field
          to  return  metrics  only from one source account. To do so, specify
          that source account ID in this field, and also specify true for  In-
          cludeLinkedAccounts .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the metrics for Amazon SNS

       The following list-metrics example displays the metrics for Amazon SNS.

          aws cloudwatch list-metrics \
              --namespace "AWS/SNS"

OUTPUT
       Metrics -> (list)
          The metrics that match your request.

          (structure)
              Represents a specific metric.

              Namespace -> (string)
                 The namespace of the metric.

              MetricName -> (string)
                 The name of the metric. This is a required field.

              Dimensions -> (list)
                 The dimensions for the metric.

                 (structure)
                     A dimension is a name/value pair  that  is  part  of  the
                     identity  of a metric. Because dimensions are part of the
                     unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique
                     name/value  pair to one of your metrics, you are creating
                     a new variation of that metric. For example, many  Amazon
                     EC2  metrics  publish InstanceId as a dimension name, and
                     the actual instance ID as the value for that dimension.

                     You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the dimension. Dimension names  must  con-
                        tain  only ASCII characters, must include at least one
                        non-whitespace character,  and  cannot  start  with  a
                        colon (: ). ASCII control characters are not supported
                        as part of dimension names.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the dimension. Dimension values must con-
                        tain  only  ASCII characters and must include at least
                        one non-whitespace character. ASCII control characters
                        are not supported as part of dimension values.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  that  marks  the start of the next batch of returned re-
          sults.

       OwningAccounts -> (list)
          If you are using this operation in a monitoring account, this  array
          contains the account IDs of the source accounts where the metrics in
          the returned data are from.

          This field is a 1:1 mapping between each metric that is returned and
          the ID of the owning account.

          (string)



                                                                LIST-METRICS()
