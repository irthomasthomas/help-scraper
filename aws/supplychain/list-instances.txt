LIST-INSTANCES()                                              LIST-INSTANCES()



NAME
       list-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       List  all Amazon Web Services Supply Chain instances for a specific ac-
       count. Enables you to programmatically list  all  Amazon  Web  Services
       Supply  Chain  instances  based on their account ID, instance name, and
       state of the instance (active or delete).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-instances is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: instances

OPTIONS
       --instance-name-filter (list)
          The filter to ListInstances based on their names.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --instance-state-filter (list)
          The filter to ListInstances based on their state.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Initializing
            Active
            CreateFailed
            DeleteFailed
            Deleting
            Deleted

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       instances -> (list)
          The list of instances resource data details.

          (structure)
              The details of the instance.

              instanceId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Supply Chain instance identifier.

              awsAccountId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID that owns the instance.

              state -> (string)
                 The state of the instance.

              errorMessage -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Supply Chain instance error  message.
                 If the instance results in an unhealthy state, customers need
                 to check the error message, delete the current instance,  and
                 recreate  a  new  one  based on the mitigation from the error
                 message.

              webAppDnsDomain -> (string)
                 The WebApp DNS domain name of the instance.

              createdTime -> (timestamp)
                 The instance creation timestamp.

                 The instance last modified timestamp.

              instanceName -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Supply Chain instance name.

              kmsKeyArn -> (string)
                 The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the Key Management  Service
                 (KMS)  key you optionally provided for encryption. If you did
                 not provide anything here, AWS Supply Chain uses  the  Amazon
                 Web Services owned KMS key and nothing is returned.

              versionNumber -> (double)
                 The version number of the instance.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token to fetch the next page of instances.
