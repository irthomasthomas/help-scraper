NAME

DESCRIPTION

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-workloads
          [--workload-name-prefix <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workload-name-prefix (string)
          An  optional string added to the beginning of each workload name re-
          turned in the results.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return for this request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       WorkloadSummaries -> (list)
          A list of workload summaries.

          (structure)
              A workload summary return object.

              WorkloadId -> (string)
                 The  ID assigned to the workload. This ID is unique within an
                 Amazon Web Services Region.

              WorkloadArn -> (string)
                 The ARN for the workload.

              WorkloadName -> (string)
                 The name of the workload.

                 The name must be unique within an account  within  an  Amazon
                 Web  Services  Region.  Spaces and capitalization are ignored

              Owner -> (string)

              UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time recorded.

              Lenses -> (list)
                 The list of lenses associated with the workload. Each lens is
                 identified by its  LensSummary$LensAlias .

                 (string)
                     The alias of the lens.

                     For  Amazon  Web Services official lenses, this is either
                     the lens alias, such as serverless ,  or  the  lens  ARN,
                     such  as  arn:aws:wellarchitected:us-west-2::lens/server-
                     less .

                     For  custom  lenses,  this  is  the  lens  ARN,  such  as
                     arn:aws:wellarchi-
                     tected:us-east-1:123456789012:lens/my-lens .

                     Each lens is identified by its  LensSummary$LensAlias .

              RiskCounts -> (map)
                 A map from risk names to the count of how questions have that
                 rating.

                 key -> (string)
                     The  risk  for  a given workload, lens review, pillar, or
                     question.

                 value -> (integer)
                     A non-negative integer that denotes how many.

              ImprovementStatus -> (string)
