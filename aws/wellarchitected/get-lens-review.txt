SYNOPSIS
            get-lens-review
          --workload-id <value>
          --lens-alias <value>
          [--milestone-number <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workload-id (string)
          The  ID assigned to the workload. This ID is unique within an Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --lens-alias (string)
          The alias of the lens.

          For Amazon Web Services official lenses, this  is  either  the  lens
          alias, such as serverless , or the lens ARN, such as arn:aws:wellar-
          chitected:us-west-2::lens/serverless .

          For custom lenses, this is the lens ARN, such as  arn:aws:wellarchi-
          tected:us-east-1:123456789012:lens/my-lens .

          Each lens is identified by its  LensSummary$LensAlias .

       --milestone-number (integer)
          The milestone number.

          A workload can have a maximum of 100 milestones.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
