          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--lens-type <value>]
          [--lens-status <value>]
          [--lens-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return for this request.

       --lens-type (string)
          The type of lenses to be returned.

          Possible values:

          o AWS_OFFICIAL

          o CUSTOM_SHARED

          o CUSTOM_SELF

       --lens-status (string)
          The status of lenses to be returned.

          Possible values:

          o ALL

          o DRAFT

          o PUBLISHED

       --lens-name (string)
          The full name of the lens.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
