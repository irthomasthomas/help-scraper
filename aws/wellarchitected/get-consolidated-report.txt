OPTIONS
       --format (string)
          The format of the consolidated report.

          For PDF , Base64String is returned. For JSON , Metrics is returned.

          Possible values:

          o PDF

          o JSON

       --include-shared-resources | --no-include-shared-resources (boolean)
          Set to true to have shared resources included in the report.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return for this request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --ca-bundle (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
