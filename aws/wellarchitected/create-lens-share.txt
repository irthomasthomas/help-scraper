CREATE-LENS-SHARE()                                        CREATE-LENS-SHARE()



NAME
       create-lens-share -

DESCRIPTION
       Create a lens share.

       The  owner  of  a  lens can share it with other Amazon Web Services ac-
       counts, users, an organization, and organizational units (OUs)  in  the
       same Amazon Web Services Region. Lenses provided by Amazon Web Services
       (Amazon Web Services Official Content) cannot be shared.

       Shared access to a lens is not removed until  the  lens  invitation  is
       deleted.

       If you share a lens with an organization or OU, all accounts in the or-
       ganization or OU are granted access to the lens.

       For more information, see Sharing a custom lens in the Well-Architected
       Tool User Guide .

       NOTE:
              Disclaimer

          By  sharing  your  custom  lenses with other Amazon Web Services ac-
          counts, you acknowledge that Amazon Web Services will make your cus-
          tom  lenses  available to those other accounts. Those other accounts
          may continue to access and use your shared custom lenses even if you
          delete  the  custom lenses from your own Amazon Web Services account
          or terminate your Amazon Web Services account.

OPTIONS
       --lens-alias (string)
          The alias of the lens.

          For Amazon Web Services official lenses, this  is  either  the  lens
          alias, such as serverless , or the lens ARN, such as arn:aws:wellar-
          chitected:us-east-1::lens/serverless .  Note  that  some  operations
          (such as ExportLens and CreateLensShare) are not permitted on Amazon
          Web Services official lenses.

          For custom lenses, this is the lens ARN, such as  arn:aws:wellarchi-
          tected:us-west-2:123456789012:lens/0123456789abcdef01234567890abcdef
          .

          Each lens is identified by its  LensSummary$LensAlias .

       --shared-with (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID, organization  ID,  or  organiza-
          tional  unit  (OU) ID with which the workload, lens, profile, or re-
          view template is shared.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique case-sensitive string used to ensure that this  request  is
          idempotent (executes only once).

          You should not reuse the same token for other requests. If you retry
          a request with the same client request token and the same parameters
          after the original request has completed successfully, the result of
          the original request is returned.

          WARNING:
              This token is listed as required, however, if you do not specify
              it,  the Amazon Web Services SDKs automatically generate one for
              you. If you are not using the Amazon Web  Services  SDK  or  the
              CLI, you must provide this token or the request will fail.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

       ShareId -> (string)
          The ID associated with the share.
