OPTIONS
       --workload-id (string)
          The  ID assigned to the workload. This ID is unique within an Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return for this request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

              MilestoneName -> (string)
                 The name of the milestone in a workload.

                 Milestone names must be unique within a workload.

              RecordedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time recorded.

              WorkloadSummary -> (structure)
                 A workload summary return object.

                 WorkloadId -> (string)
                     The ID assigned to the workload. This ID is unique within
                     an Amazon Web Services Region.

                 WorkloadArn -> (string)
                     The ARN for the workload.

                 WorkloadName -> (string)

                     The name must be unique within an account within an  Ama-
                     zon  Web  Services  Region. Spaces and capitalization are
                     ignored when checking for uniqueness.

                 Lenses -> (list)
                     The list of lenses associated  with  the  workload.  Each
                     lens is identified by its  LensSummary$LensAlias .

                     If  a review template that specifies lenses is applied to
                     the workload, those lenses are applied to the workload in
                     addition to these lenses.

                     (string)
                        The alias of the lens.

                        For  Amazon  Web Services official lenses, this is ei-
                        ther the lens alias, such as serverless , or the  lens
                        ARN,         such         as        arn:aws:wellarchi-
                        tected:us-east-1::lens/serverless . Note that some op-
                        erations  (such as ExportLens and CreateLensShare) are
                        not permitted on Amazon Web Services official lenses.

                        For custom lenses, this  is  the  lens  ARN,  such  as
                        arn:aws:wellarchi-
                        tected:us-west-2:123456789012:lens/0123456789abcdef01234567890abcdef
                        .

                        Each  lens is identified by its  LensSummary$LensAlias
                        .
