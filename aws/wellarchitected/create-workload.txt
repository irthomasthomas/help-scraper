CREATE-WORKLOAD()                                            CREATE-WORKLOAD()



NAME
       create-workload -

DESCRIPTION
       Create a new workload.

       The  owner  of  a workload can share the workload with other Amazon Web
       Services accounts, users, an  organization,  and  organizational  units
       (OUs) in the same Amazon Web Services Region. Only the owner of a work-
       load can delete it.

       For more information, see Defining a Workload in  the  Well-Architected
       Tool User Guide .

       WARNING:
          Either  AwsRegions  , NonAwsRegions , or both must be specified when
          creating a workload.

          You also must specify ReviewOwner , even  though  the  parameter  is
          listed as not being required in the following section.

       When  creating  a  workload  using a review template, you must have the
       following IAM permissions:

       o wellarchitected:GetReviewTemplate

       o wellarchitected:GetReviewTemplateAnswer

       o wellarchitected:ListReviewTemplateAnswers

       o wellarchitected:GetReviewTemplateLensReview

              For Amazon Web Services official lenses, this is either the lens
              alias,  such  as  serverless  ,  or  the  lens  ARN,   such   as

          with the workload when the template is applied.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A  unique  case-sensitive string used to ensure that this request is
          idempotent (executes only once).

          You should not reuse the same token for other requests. If you retry
          a request with the same client request token and the same parameters
          after the original request has completed successfully, the result of
          the original request is returned.

          WARNING:
              This token is listed as required, however, if you do not specify
              it, the Amazon Web Services SDKs automatically generate one  for
              you.  If  you  are  not using the Amazon Web Services SDK or the
              CLI, you must provide this token or the request will fail.
