SYNOPSIS
            list-workload-shares

          [--shared-with-prefix <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workload-id (string)
          The  ID assigned to the workload. This ID is unique within an Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --shared-with-prefix (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID or IAM role with which the  work-
          load is shared.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return for this request.

       --status (string)
          The status of a workload share.

          Possible values:

          o ACCEPTED

          o REJECTED

          o PENDING

          o REVOKED

          o EXPIRED

          o ASSOCIATING

          o ASSOCIATED

          o FAILED

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
