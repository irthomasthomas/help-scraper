OPTIONS
       --workload-id (string)
          The  ID assigned to the workload. This ID is unique within an Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return for this request.

       --resource-arn (string)
          The ARN for the related resource for the notification.

          NOTE:
              Only one of WorkloadID or ResourceARN should be specified.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

OUTPUT
       NotificationSummaries -> (list)
          List of lens notification summaries in a workload.

                     an Amazon Web Services Region.

                 WorkloadName -> (string)
                     The name of the workload.

                     The name must be unique within an account within an  Ama-
                     zon  Web  Services  Region. Spaces and capitalization are

                 LensAlias -> (string)
                     The alias of the lens.

                     For Amazon Web Services official lenses, this  is  either
                     the  lens  alias,  such  as serverless , or the lens ARN,
                     such  as  arn:aws:wellarchitected:us-east-1::lens/server-
                     less  . Note that some operations (such as ExportLens and
                     CreateLensShare) are not permitted on Amazon Web Services
                     official lenses.

                     For  custom  lenses,  this  is  the  lens  ARN,  such  as

                     tected:us-west-2:123456789012:lens/0123456789abcdef01234567890abcdef
                     .

                     Each lens is identified by its  LensSummary$LensAlias .

                 LensArn -> (string)
                     The ARN for the lens.

                 CurrentLensVersion -> (string)
                     The current version of the lens.

                 LatestLensVersion -> (string)
                     The latest version of the lens.

                 ResourceArn -> (string)
                     ResourceArn of the lens being upgraded

                 ResourceName -> (string)
                     The name of the workload.

                     The name must be unique within an account within an  Ama-
                     zon  Web  Services  Region. Spaces and capitalization are
                     ignored when checking for uniqueness.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next set of results.
