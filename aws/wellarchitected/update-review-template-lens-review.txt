OPTIONS
       --template-arn (string)
          The review template ARN.

       --lens-alias (string)
          The alias of the lens.

          For  Amazon  Web  Services  official lenses, this is either the lens
          alias, such as serverless , or the lens ARN, such as arn:aws:wellar-
          chitected:us-east-1::lens/serverless  .  Note  that  some operations
          (such as ExportLens and CreateLensShare) are not permitted on Amazon
          Web Services official lenses.

          For  custom lenses, this is the lens ARN, such as arn:aws:wellarchi-
          tected:us-west-2:123456789012:lens/0123456789abcdef01234567890abcdef
          .

          Each lens is identified by its  LensSummary$LensAlias .

       --lens-notes (string)
          The notes associated with the workload.

          For  a  review template, these are the notes that will be associated
          with the workload when the template is applied.

       --pillar-notes (map)
          List of pillar notes of a lens review in a workload.

          For a review template, these are the notes that will  be  associated
          with the workload when the template is applied.

          key -> (string)
              The ID used to identify a pillar, for example, security .

              A pillar is identified by its  PillarReviewSummary$PillarId .

          value -> (string)
              The notes associated with the workload.

              For  a review template, these are the notes that will be associ-
              ated with the workload when the template is applied.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
