NAME
       guardduty -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that ana-
       lyzes and processes the following data  sources:  VPC  Flow  Logs,  AWS
       CloudTrail  management  event  logs, CloudTrail S3 data event logs, EKS
       audit logs, and DNS logs. It uses threat intelligence  feeds  (such  as
       lists  of  malicious  IPs and domains) and machine learning to identify
       unexpected, potentially unauthorized,  and  malicious  activity  within
       your  Amazon Web Services environment. This can include issues like es-
       calations of privileges, uses of exposed credentials, or  communication
       with malicious IPs, URLs, or domains. For example, GuardDuty can detect
       compromised EC2 instances that serve malware or mine bitcoin.

       GuardDuty also monitors Amazon Web Services account access behavior for
       signs of compromise. Some examples of this are unauthorized infrastruc-
       ture deployments such as EC2 instances deployed in a  Region  that  has
       never  been used, or unusual API calls like a password policy change to
       reduce password strength.

       GuardDuty informs you of the status of your Amazon Web  Services  envi-
       ronment  by producing security findings that you can view in the Guard-
       Duty console or through Amazon CloudWatch events. For more information,
       see the * Amazon GuardDuty User Guide * .
