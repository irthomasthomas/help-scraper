NAME
       guardduty -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that ana-
       lyzes and processes the following data sources: VPC flow  logs,  Amazon
       Web Services CloudTrail management event logs, CloudTrail S3 data event
       logs, EKS audit logs, and DNS logs. It uses threat  intelligence  feeds
       (such  as  lists  of malicious IPs and domains) and machine learning to
       identify unexpected, potentially unauthorized, and  malicious  activity
       within  your  Amazon  Web Services environment. This can include issues
       like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed credentials, or  commu-
       nication  with  malicious IPs, URLs, or domains. For example, GuardDuty
       can detect compromised EC2 instances that serve malware  or  mine  bit-
       coin.

       GuardDuty also monitors Amazon Web Services account access behavior for
       signs of compromise. Some examples of this are unauthorized infrastruc-
       ture  deployments  such  as EC2 instances deployed in a Region that has
       never been used, or unusual API calls like a password policy change  to
       reduce password strength.

       GuardDuty  informs  you of the status of your Amazon Web Services envi-
       ronment by producing security findings that you can view in the  Guard-
       Duty console or through Amazon CloudWatch events. For more information,
       see the * Amazon GuardDuty User Guide * .
