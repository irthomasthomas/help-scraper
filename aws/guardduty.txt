NAME
       guardduty -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that ana-
       lyzes and processes the following foundational data sources - VPC  flow
       logs,  Amazon Web Services CloudTrail management event logs, CloudTrail
       S3 data event logs, EKS audit logs, DNS logs, Amazon EBS  volume  data,
       runtime  activity belonging to container workloads, such as Amazon EKS,
       Amazon ECS (including Amazon Web Services Fargate), and Amazon EC2  in-
       stances.  It uses threat intelligence feeds, such as lists of malicious
       IPs and domains, and machine learning to  identify  unexpected,  poten-
       tially unauthorized, and malicious activity within your Amazon Web Ser-
       vices environment. This can include issues like escalations  of  privi-
       leges,  uses  of  exposed  credentials, or communication with malicious
       IPs, domains, or presence of malware on your Amazon EC2  instances  and
       container  workloads. For example, GuardDuty can detect compromised EC2
       instances and container workloads serving malware, or mining bitcoin.

       GuardDuty also monitors Amazon Web Services account access behavior for
       signs  of  compromise,  such as unauthorized infrastructure deployments
       like EC2 instances deployed in a Region that has never  been  used,  or
       unusual  API  calls  like  a  password policy change to reduce password
       strength.

       GuardDuty informs you about the status of your Amazon Web Services  en-
       vironment  by  producing  security  findings  that  you can view in the
       GuardDuty console or through Amazon EventBridge. For more  information,
       see the * Amazon GuardDuty User Guide * .
