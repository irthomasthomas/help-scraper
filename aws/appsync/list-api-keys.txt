LIST-API-KEYS()                                                LIST-API-KEYS()



NAME
       list-api-keys -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the API keys for a given API.

       NOTE:
          API  keys  are deleted automatically 60 days after they expire. How-
          ever, they may still be included in the response until they have ac-
          tually  been  deleted.  You can safely call DeleteApiKey to manually
          delete a key before it's automatically deleted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-api-keys is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: apiKeys

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The API ID.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       apiKeys -> (list)
          The ApiKey objects.

          (structure)
              Describes an API key.

              Customers invoke AppSync GraphQL API operations with API keys as
              an identity mechanism. There are two key versions:
                 da1  : We introduced this version at launch in November 2017.
                 These keys always expire after 7 days.  Amazon  DynamoDB  TTL
                 manages  key  expiration. These keys ceased to be valid after
                 February 21, 2018, and they should no longer be used.

              o ListApiKeys returns the expiration time in milliseconds.

              o CreateApiKey returns the expiration time in milliseconds.

              o UpdateApiKey is not available for this key version.

              o DeleteApiKey deletes the item from the table.

              o Expiration is stored in DynamoDB as milliseconds. This results
                in  a bug where keys are not automatically deleted because Dy-
                namoDB expects the TTL to be stored in seconds. As a  one-time
                action,  we  deleted these keys from the table on February 21,
                2018.
                 da2 : We introduced this version in February 2018  when  App-
                 Sync added support to extend key expiration.

              o ListApiKeys  returns  the expiration time and deletion time in
                seconds.

              o CreateApiKey returns the expiration time and deletion time  in
                seconds  and  accepts  a user-provided expiration time in sec-
                onds.

              o UpdateApiKey returns the expiration time and and deletion time
                in seconds and accepts a user-provided expiration time in sec-
                onds. Expired API keys are kept for 60 days after the  expira-
                tion  time.  You can update the key expiration time as long as
                the key isn't deleted.

              o DeleteApiKey deletes the item from the table.

              o Expiration is stored in DynamoDB as seconds. After the expira-
                tion  time,  using the key to authenticate will fail. However,
                you can reinstate the key before deletion.

              o Deletion is stored in DynamoDB as seconds. The key is  deleted
                after deletion time.

              id -> (string)
                 The API key ID.

              description -> (string)
                 A description of the purpose of the API key.

              expires -> (long)
                 The  time after which the API key expires. The date is repre-
                 sented as seconds since the epoch, rounded down to the  near-
                 est hour.

              deletes -> (long)
                 The time after which the API key is deleted. The date is rep-
                 resented as seconds since the  epoch,  rounded  down  to  the
                 nearest hour.

       nextToken -> (string)
          An  identifier  to pass in the next request to this operation to re-
          turn the next set of items in the list.
