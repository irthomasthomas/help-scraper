LIST-GRAPHQL-APIS()                                        LIST-GRAPHQL-APIS()



NAME
       list-graphql-apis -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists your GraphQL APIs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-graphql-apis  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: graphqlApis

OPTIONS
       --api-type (string)
          The value that indicates whether the GraphQL API is a  standard  API
          (GRAPHQL ) or merged API (MERGED ).

          Possible values:

          o GRAPHQL

          o MERGED

       --owner (string)
          The account owner of the GraphQL API.

          Possible values:

          o CURRENT_ACCOUNT

          o OTHER_ACCOUNTS

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                     when the relying party  is  registered  with  the  OpenID
                     identity  provider.  You can specify a regular expression
                     so that AppSync  can  validate  against  multiple  client
                     identifiers at a time.

                 GraphqlApi API.

                 (structure)
                     Describes an additional authentication provider.

                     authenticationType -> (string)
                        The authentication type: API key, Identity and  Access

                            cally obtained when the relying  party  is  regis-
                            tered  with  the OpenID identity provider. You can
                            specify a regular expression so that  AppSync  can
                            validate  against multiple client identifiers at a
                            time.

                        iatTTL -> (long)

                     lambdaAuthorizerConfig -> (structure)
                        Configuration for Lambda function authorization.

                        authorizerResultTtlInSeconds -> (integer)
                            The  number of seconds a response should be cached
                            for. The default  is  0  seconds,  which  disables
                            caching.  If  you don't specify a value for autho-
                            rizerResultTtlInSeconds ,  the  default  value  is
                            used.  The  maximum  value  is one hour (3600 sec-
                            onds). The Lambda function can  override  this  by
                            returning a ttlOverride key in its response.

                        authorizerUri -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda func-
                            tion to be called for authorization. This can be a
                            standard  Lambda  ARN, a version ARN (.../v3 ), or
                            an alias ARN.
                               Note : This Lambda function must have the  fol-
                               lowing  resource-based  policy  assigned to it.
                               When configuring Lambda authorizers in the con-
                               sole,  this is done for you. To use the Command
                               Line Interface (CLI), run the following:

                               aws   lambda   add-permission   --function-name
                               "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:111122223333:func-
                               tion:my-function"   --statement-id    "appsync"
                               --principal    appsync.amazonaws.com   --action
                               lambda:InvokeFunction

                        identityValidationExpression -> (string)
                            A regular expression for validation of tokens  be-
                            fore the Lambda function is called.

              xrayEnabled -> (boolean)
                 A  flag  indicating  whether  to  use  X-Ray tracing for this
                 GraphqlApi .

              wafWebAclArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the WAF access control list (ACL) associated  with
                 this GraphqlApi , if one exists.

              lambdaAuthorizerConfig -> (structure)
                 Configuration for Lambda function authorization.

                 authorizerResultTtlInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The  number  of  seconds a response should be cached for.
                     The default is 0 seconds, which disables caching. If  you
                     don't  specify a value for authorizerResultTtlInSeconds ,
                     the default value is used. The maximum value is one  hour
                     (3600  seconds). The Lambda function can override this by
                     returning a ttlOverride key in its response.

                 authorizerUri -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda function  to
                     be  called  for  authorization.  This  can  be a standard
                     Lambda ARN, a version ARN (.../v3 ), or an alias ARN.
                        Note : This Lambda function must  have  the  following
                        resource-based policy assigned to it. When configuring
                        Lambda authorizers in the console, this  is  done  for
                        you.  To use the Command Line Interface (CLI), run the
                        following:

                        aws     lambda     add-permission      --function-name
                        "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:111122223333:func-
                        tion:my-function" --statement-id "appsync" --principal

                 identityValidationExpression -> (string)
                     A  regular expression for validation of tokens before the
                     Lambda function is called.

              dns -> (map)
                 The DNS records for the API.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              visibility -> (string)
                 Sets the value of the GraphQL API to public (GLOBAL ) or pri-
                 vate (PRIVATE ). If no value is provided, the visibility will
                 be set to GLOBAL by default. This  value  cannot  be  changed
                 once the API has been created.

              apiType -> (string)
                 The  value  that indicates whether the GraphQL API is a stan-
                 dard API (GRAPHQL ) or merged API (MERGED ).

              mergedApiExecutionRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Identity and Access Management service  role  ARN  for  a
                 merged  API.  The AppSync service assumes this role on behalf
                 of the Merged API to validate access to source APIs  at  run-
                 time  and  to  prompt the AUTO_MERGE to update the merged API
                 endpoint with the source API changes automatically.

              owner -> (string)
                 The account owner of the GraphQL API.

              ownerContact -> (string)
                 The owner contact information for an API resource.

                 This field accepts any string input with a length of 0 -  256
                 characters.

              introspectionConfig -> (string)
                 Sets  the  value  of  the GraphQL API to enable (ENABLED ) or
                 disable (DISABLED ) introspection. If no value  is  provided,
                 the introspection configuration will be set to ENABLED by de-
                 fault. This field will produce an error if the operation  at-
                 tempts  to  use the introspection feature while this field is
                 disabled.

                 For more information about introspection, see GraphQL  intro-
                 spection .

              queryDepthLimit -> (integer)
                 The maximum depth a query can have in a single request. Depth
                 refers to the amount of nested levels allowed in the body  of
                 query.  The  default value is 0 (or unspecified), which indi-
                 cates there's no depth limit. If you set a limit, it  can  be
                 between  1  and  75  nested levels. This field will produce a
                 limit error if the operation falls out of bounds.

                 Note that fields can still be set  to  nullable  or  non-nul-
                 lable.  If  a non-nullable field produces an error, the error
                 will be thrown upwards to the first nullable field available.

              resolverCountLimit -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of resolvers that can be invoked in a sin-
                 gle  request.  The default value is 0 (or unspecified), which
                 will set the limit to 10000 . When specified, the limit value
                 can  be between 1 and 10000 . This field will produce a limit
                 error if the operation falls out of bounds.

       nextToken -> (string)
          An identifier to pass in the next request to this operation  to  re-
          turn the next set of items in the list.
