OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The Api ID.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                            OpenID identity provider. This identifier is typi-
                            cally  obtained  when  the relying party is regis-
                            tered with the OpenID identity provider.  You  can
                            specify  a  regular expression so that AppSync can
                            validate against multiple client identifiers at  a
                            time.

                        iatTTL -> (long)

                            The number of milliseconds that a token  is  valid
                            after being authenticated.

                     lambdaAuthorizerConfig -> (structure)
                        A  LambdaAuthorizerConfig  specifies  how to authorize
                        AppSync API access when using  the  AWS_LAMBDA  autho-
                        rizer mode. Be aware that an AppSync API can have only
                        one Lambda authorizer configured at a time.

                        authorizerResultTtlInSeconds -> (integer)
                            The number of seconds a response should be  cached
                            for.  The  default  is  0  seconds, which disables
                            caching. If you don't specify a value  for  autho-
                            rizerResultTtlInSeconds  ,  the  default  value is
                            used. The maximum value is  one  hour  (3600  sec-
                            onds).  The  Lambda  function can override this by
                            returning a ttlOverride key in its response.

                        authorizerUri -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda func-
                            tion to be called for authorization. This can be a
                            standard Lambda ARN, a version ARN (.../v3  ),  or
                            an alias ARN.
                               Note  : This Lambda function must have the fol-
                               lowing resource-based policy  assigned  to  it.
                               When configuring Lambda authorizers in the con-
                               sole, this is done for you. To use the  Command
                               Line Interface (CLI), run the following:
