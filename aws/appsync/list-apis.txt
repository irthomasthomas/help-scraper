LIST-APIS()                                                        LIST-APIS()



NAME
       list-apis -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the APIs in your AppSync account.
          ListApis  returns only the high level API details. For more detailed
          information about an API, use GetApi .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-apis is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation by providing the --no-paginate argument.   When  using  --output
       text  and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query ar-
       gument must extract data from the results of the  following  query  ex-
       pressions: apis

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                            appIdClientRegex -> (string)
                               A regular expression for validating the  incom-
                               ing  Amazon Cognito user pool app client ID. If
                               this value isn't set, no filtering is applied.

                        openIDConnectConfig -> (structure)

                               The client identifier of the relying  party  at
                               the  OpenID  identity provider. This identifier
                               is typically obtained when the relying party is
                               registered  with  the OpenID identity provider.
                               You can specify a regular  expression  so  that
                               AppSync  can  validate  against multiple client
                               identifiers at a time.

                            iatTTL -> (long)

                               valid after it's issued to a user.

                            authTTL -> (long)
                               The  number  of  milliseconds  that  a token is
                               valid after being authenticated.

                        lambdaAuthorizerConfig -> (structure)
                            A LambdaAuthorizerConfig specifies how  to  autho-
                            rize  AppSync API access when using the AWS_LAMBDA
                            authorizer mode. Be aware that an AppSync API  can
                            have  only  one  Lambda authorizer configured at a
                            time.

                            authorizerResultTtlInSeconds -> (integer)
                               The number of  seconds  a  response  should  be
                               cached  for.  The  default  is 0 seconds, which
                               disables caching. If you don't specify a  value
                               for  authorizerResultTtlInSeconds , the default
                               value is used. The maximum value  is  one  hour
                               (3600  seconds).  The Lambda function can over-
                               ride this by returning a ttlOverride key in its
                               response.

                            authorizerUri -> (string)
                               The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the Lambda
                               function to be called for  authorization.  This
                               can  be  a  standard  Lambda ARN, a version ARN
                               (.../v3 ), or an alias ARN.
                                   Note : This Lambda function must  have  the
                                   following resource-based policy assigned to
                                   it. When configuring Lambda authorizers  in
                                   the  console,  this is done for you. To use
                                   the Command Line Interface (CLI),  run  the
                                   following:

                     (structure)
                        Describes an authorization configuration. Use AuthMode
                        to specify the publishing and subscription  authoriza-
