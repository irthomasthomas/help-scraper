PUT-GRAPHQL-API-ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLES()PUT-GRAPHQL-API-ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLES()



NAME
       put-graphql-api-environment-variables -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a list of environmental variables in an API by its ID value.

       When creating an environmental variable, it must follow the constraints
       below:

       o Both JavaScript and VTL templates support environmental variables.

       o Environmental variables are not evaluated before function invocation.

       o Environmental variables only support string values.

       o Any defined value in an environmental variable is considered a string
         literal and not expanded.

       o Variable  evaluations  should  ideally  be  performed in the function
         code.

       When creating an environmental variable key-value pair, it must  follow
       the additional constraints below:

       o Keys must begin with a letter.

       o Keys must be at least two characters long.

       o Keys  can only contain letters, numbers, and the underscore character
         (_).

       o Values can be up to 512 characters long.

       o You can configure up to 50 key-value pairs in a GraphQL API.

       You can create a list of environmental variables by adding  it  to  the
       environmentVariables    payload    as    a    list    in   the   format
       {"key1":"value1","key2":"value2", } . Note that each call of  the  Put-
       GraphqlApiEnvironmentVariables action will result in the overwriting of
       the existing environmental variable list of that API.  This  means  the
       existing  environmental variables will be lost. To avoid this, you must
       include all existing and new environmental variables in the  list  each
       time you call this action.

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The  ID  of the API to which the environmental variable list will be
          written.

       --environment-variables (map)
          The list of environmental variables to add to the API.

          When creating an environmental variable key-value pair, it must fol-
          low the additional constraints below:

          o Keys must begin with a letter.

          o Keys must be at least two characters long.

          o Keys can only contain letters, numbers, and the underscore charac-
            ter (_).

          o Values can be up to 512 characters long.

          o You can configure up to 50 key-value pairs in a GraphQL API.

          You can create a list of environmental variables by adding it to the
          environmentVariables    payload    as   a   list   in   the   format
          {"key1":"value1","key2":"value2", } . Note that  each  call  of  the
          PutGraphqlApiEnvironmentVariables  action  will  result in the over-
          writing of the existing environmental variable  list  of  that  API.
          This  means  the  existing  environmental variables will be lost. To
          avoid this, you must include  all  existing  and  new  environmental
          variables in the list each time you call this action.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       environmentVariables -> (map)
          The  payload  containing  each environmental variable in the "key" :
          "value" format.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
