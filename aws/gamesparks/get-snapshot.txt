GET-SNAPSHOT()                                                  GET-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       get-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a copy of the game configuration in a snapshot.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-snapshot  uses document type values. Document types follow the JSON
       data model where valid values are: strings,  numbers,  booleans,  null,
       arrays,  and  objects. For command input, options and nested parameters
       that are labeled with the type  document  must  be  provided  as  JSON.
       Shorthand syntax does not support document types.

SYNOPSIS
            get-snapshot
          --game-name <value>
          [--sections <value>]
          --snapshot-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --game-name (string)
          The name of the game.

       --sections (list)
          The list of game configuration sections to be described.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --snapshot-id (string)
          The identifier of the snapshot.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
