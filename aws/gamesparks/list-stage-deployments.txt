LIST-STAGE-DEPLOYMENTS()                              LIST-STAGE-DEPLOYMENTS()



NAME
       list-stage-deployments -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a paginated list of stage deployment summaries from the game.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-stage-deployments is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: StageDeployments

SYNOPSIS
            list-stage-deployments
          --game-name <value>
          --stage-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --game-name (string)
          The name of the game.

       --stage-name (string)
          The name of the stage.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The token that indicates the start of the next  sequential  page  of
          results.

          Use  this  value when making the next call to this operation to con-
          tinue where the last one finished.

       StageDeployments -> (list)
          A list of stage deployment summaries. You can use the deployment IDs
          in the UpdateStageDeployment and GetStageDeployment actions.

          (structure)
              The summary of the properties of a stage deployment.

              DeploymentAction -> (string)
                 The type of action of the deployment.

              DeploymentId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the deployment.

              DeploymentState -> (string)
                 The state of the deployment.

              LastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp of when the deployment was last updated.

              SnapshotId -> (string)
                 The  identifier of the snapshot associated with the stage de-
                 ployment.
