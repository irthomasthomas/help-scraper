SYNOPSIS
            create-stage
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          --game-name <value>
          --role <value>
          --stage-name <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A  client-defined token. With an active client token in the request,
          this action is idempotent.

       --description (string)
          The description of the stage.

       --game-name (string)
          The name of the game.

       --role (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to  run  the  game  with.
          This role can be a game-defined role or the default role that GameS-
          parks created.

       --stage-name (string)
          The name of the stage.

       --tags (map)
          The list of tags to apply to the stage.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
