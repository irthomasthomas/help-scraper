NAME
       update-game-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates one or more sections of the game configuration.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       update-game-configuration  uses  document  type  values. Document types
       follow the JSON data model where valid values  are:  strings,  numbers,
       booleans,  null,  arrays,  and  objects. For command input, options and
       nested parameters that are labeled with the type document must be  pro-
       vided as JSON. Shorthand syntax does not support document types.

SYNOPSIS
            update-game-configuration
          --game-name <value>
          --modifications <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --game-name (string)
          The name of the game.

       --modifications (list)
          The list of modifications to make.

          (structure)
              A single modification to the configuration section.

              Operation -> (string)
                 The operation to be performed on a configuration section.

                 Content can be added, deleted, or replaced within a section.

              Path -> (string)
                 The path within the section content to be modified.

              Section -> (string)
                 The name of the section to be modified.

              Value -> (document)
                 For  add  and replace operations, this is the value that will
                 be used.

                 This field should be omitted for delete operations.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Operation=string,Path=string,Section=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Operation": "ADD"|"REMOVE"|"REPLACE",
              "Path": "string",
              "Section": "string",
              "Value": {...}
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
