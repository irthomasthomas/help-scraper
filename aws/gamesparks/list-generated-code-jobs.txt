LIST-GENERATED-CODE-JOBS()                          LIST-GENERATED-CODE-JOBS()



NAME
       list-generated-code-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a paginated list of code generation jobs for a snapshot.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-generated-code-jobs  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: GeneratedCodeJobs

SYNOPSIS
            list-generated-code-jobs
          --game-name <value>
          --snapshot-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --game-name (string)
          The name of the game.

       --snapshot-id (string)
          The identifier of the snapshot.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GeneratedCodeJobs -> (list)
          The list of generated code jobs.

          (structure)
              Details about a generated code job.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the generated code job.

              ExpirationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The expiration date and time for the download URL.

                 The download URL us guaranteed to be available until at least
                 this time.

              GeneratedCodeJobId -> (string)
                 The identifier for the generated code job.

              S3Url -> (string)
                 A  presigned  URL  that can be used to download the generated
                 code.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the generated code job

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token that indicates the start of the next  sequential  page  of
          results.

          Use  this  value when making the next call to this operation to con-
          tinue where the last one finished.
