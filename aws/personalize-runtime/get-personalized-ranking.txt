       user.

          recipe of type PERSONALIZED_RANKING.

OPTIONS
       --campaign-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the campaign to use for generating
          the personalized ranking.

       --input-list (list)
          A list of items (by itemId ) to rank. If an item was not included in
          the training dataset, the  item  is  appended  to  the  end  of  the
          reranked list. If you are including metadata in recommendations, the
          maximum is 50. Otherwise, the maximum is 500.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --user-id (string)
          The user for which you want the campaign to provide  a  personalized
          ranking.

       --context (map)
          The contextual metadata to use when getting recommendations. Contex-
          tual metadata includes any interaction  information  that  might  be
          relevant  when  getting a user's recommendations, such as the user's
          current location or device type.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --filter-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a filter you  created  to  include
          items  or  exclude  items from recommendations for a given user. For
          more information, see Filtering Recommendations .

       --filter-values (map)
          The values to use when filtering recommendations.  For  each  place-
          holder  parameter  in  your filter expression, provide the parameter
          name (in matching case) as a key and the filter value(s) as the cor-
          responding  value. Separate multiple values for one parameter with a
          comma.

          For filter expressions that use an INCLUDE element to include items,
          you  must  provide values for all parameters that are defined in the
          expression. For filters with expressions that use an EXCLUDE element
          to exclude items, you can omit the filter-values .In this case, Ama-
          zon Personalize doesn't use that portion of the expression to filter
          recommendations.

          For more information, see Filtering Recommendations .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --metadata-columns (map)
          If  you  enabled metadata in recommendations when you created or up-
          dated the campaign, specify metadata columns from your Items dataset
          to include in the personalized ranking. The map key is ITEMS and the
          value is a list of column names from your Items dataset. The maximum
          number of columns you can provide is 10.

          For information about enabling metadata for a campaign, see Enabling
          metadata in recommendations for a campaign .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": ["string", ...]
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,

          maximum is 500.

          (structure)

              promotionName -> (string)
                 The name of the promotion that included the predicted item.

              metadata -> (map)

                 value -> (string)

              reason -> (list)
                 If you use User-Personalization-v2, a list of reasons for why

                 include the following:

                 o Promoted item - Indicates the item was included as part  of
                   a  promotion  that  you  applied in your recommendation re-
                   quest.

                 o Exploration - Indicates the item was included  with  explo-
                   ration.  With  exploration,  recommendations  include items
                   with less interactions data or relevance for the user.  For
                   more information about exploration, see Exploration .

                 o Popular  item - Indicates the item was included as a place-
                   holder popular item. If you use a filter, depending on  how
                   many recommendations the filter removes, Amazon Personalize
                   might add placeholder items to meet the numResults for your
                   recommendation  request.  These  items  are  popular items,
                   based on interactions data, that satisfy your filter crite-
                   ria. They don't have a relevance score for the user.

                 (string)

       recommendationId -> (string)
          The ID of the recommendation.
