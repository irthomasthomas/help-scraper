GET-RECOMMENDATIONS()                                    GET-RECOMMENDATIONS()



NAME
       get-recommendations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of recommended items. For campaigns, the campaign's Ama-
       zon Resource Name (ARN) is required and the required user and item  in-
       put  depends on the recipe type used to create the solution backing the
       campaign as follows:

       o USER_PERSONALIZATION - userId required, itemId not used

       o RELATED_ITEMS - itemId required, userId not used

       NOTE:
          Campaigns that are backed by a solution created using  a  recipe  of
          type PERSONALIZED_RANKING use the API.

       For  recommenders,  the  recommender's ARN is required and the required
       item and user input depends on the use case (domain-based recipe) back-
       ing  the  recommender.  For  information  on  use case requirements see
       Choosing recommender use cases .

OPTIONS
       --campaign-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the campaign to  use  for  getting
          recommendations.

       --item-id (string)
          The item ID to provide recommendations for.

          Required for RELATED_ITEMS recipe type.

       --user-id (string)
          The user ID to provide recommendations for.

          Required for USER_PERSONALIZATION recipe type.

       --num-results (integer)
          The  number  of results to return. The default is 25. If you are in-
          cluding metadata in recommendations, the maximum is  50.  Otherwise,
          the maximum is 500.

       --context (map)
          The contextual metadata to use when getting recommendations. Contex-
          tual metadata includes any interaction  information  that  might  be
          relevant  when  getting a user's recommendations, such as the user's
          current location or device type.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --filter-arn (string)
          The ARN of the filter to apply to the returned recommendations.  For
          more information, see Filtering Recommendations .

          When using this parameter, be sure the filter resource is ACTIVE .

       --filter-values (map)
          The  values  to  use when filtering recommendations. For each place-
          holder parameter in your filter expression,  provide  the  parameter
          name (in matching case) as a key and the filter value(s) as the cor-
          responding value. Separate multiple values for one parameter with  a
          comma.

          For filter expressions that use an INCLUDE element to include items,
          you must provide values for all parameters that are defined  in  the
          expression. For filters with expressions that use an EXCLUDE element
          to exclude items, you can omit the filter-values .In this case, Ama-
          zon Personalize doesn't use that portion of the expression to filter
          recommendations.

          For more information, see Filtering recommendations  and  user  seg-
          ments .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --recommender-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recommender to use to get rec-
          ommendations. Provide a recommender ARN  if  you  created  a  Domain
          dataset group with a recommender for a domain use case.

       --promotions (list)
          The  promotions  to apply to the recommendation request. A promotion
          defines additional business rules that apply to a configurable  sub-
          set of recommended items.

          (structure)
              Contains  information  on a promotion. A promotion defines addi-
              tional business rules that apply to  a  configurable  subset  of
              recommended items.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the promotion.

              percentPromotedItems -> (integer)
                 The  percentage  of  recommended items to apply the promotion
                 to.

              filterArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the filter used by the pro-
                 motion.  This filter defines the criteria for promoted items.
                 For more information, see Promotion filters .

              filterValues -> (map)
                 The values to use when promoting items. For each  placeholder
                 parameter  in your promotion's filter expression, provide the
                 parameter name (in matching case) as a  key  and  the  filter
                 value(s) as the corresponding value. Separate multiple values
                 for one parameter with a comma.

                 For filter expressions that use an INCLUDE element to include
                 items,  you  must  provide values for all parameters that are
                 defined in the expression. For filters with expressions  that
                 use  an  EXCLUDE  element  to exclude items, you can omit the
                 filter-values . In this case, Amazon Personalize doesn't  use
                 that portion of the expression to filter recommendations.

                 For  more information on creating filters, see Filtering rec-
                 ommendations and user segments .

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "percentPromotedItems": integer,
              "filterArn": "string",
              "filterValues": {"string": "string"
                ...}
            }
            ...
          ]

       --metadata-columns (map)
          If you enabled metadata in recommendations when you created  or  up-
          dated the campaign or recommender, specify the metadata columns from
          your Items dataset to include in item recommendations. The  map  key
          is  ITEMS  and  the  value is a list of column names from your Items
          dataset. The maximum number of columns you can provide is 10.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                 include the following:

                 o Promoted  item - Indicates the item was included as part of
                   a promotion that you applied  in  your  recommendation  re-
                   quest.

                 o Exploration  -  Indicates the item was included with explo-
                   ration. With  exploration,  recommendations  include  items
                   with  less interactions data or relevance for the user. For
                   more information about exploration, see Exploration .

                 o Popular item - Indicates the item was included as a  place-
                   holder  popular item. If you use a filter, depending on how
                   many recommendations the filter removes, Amazon Personalize
                   might add placeholder items to meet the numResults for your
                   recommendation request.  These  items  are  popular  items,
                   based on interactions data, that satisfy your filter crite-
                   ria. They don't have a relevance score for the user.

                 (string)

       recommendationId -> (string)
          The ID of the recommendation.
