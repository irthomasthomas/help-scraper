GET-RECOMMENDATIONS()                                    GET-RECOMMENDATIONS()



NAME
       get-recommendations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of recommended items. For campaigns, the campaign's Ama-
       zon Resource Name (ARN) is required and the required user and item  in-
       put  depends on the recipe type used to create the solution backing the
       campaign as follows:

       o USER_PERSONALIZATION - userId required, itemId not used

       o RELATED_ITEMS - itemId required, userId not used

       NOTE:
          Campaigns that are backed by a solution created using  a  recipe  of
          type PERSONALIZED_RANKING use the API.

       For  recommenders,  the  recommender's ARN is required and the required
       item and user input depends on the use case (domain-based recipe) back-
       ing  the  recommender.  For  information  on  use case requirements see
       Choosing recommender use cases .

OPTIONS
       --campaign-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the campaign to  use  for  getting
          recommendations.

       --item-id (string)
          The item ID to provide recommendations for.

          Required for RELATED_ITEMS recipe type.

       --user-id (string)
          The user ID to provide recommendations for.

          Required for USER_PERSONALIZATION recipe type.

       --num-results (integer)
          The  number  of results to return. The default is 25. The maximum is
          500.

       --context (map)
          The contextual metadata to use when getting recommendations. Contex-
          tual  metadata  includes  any  interaction information that might be
          relevant when getting a user's recommendations, such as  the  user's
          current location or device type.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --filter-arn (string)
          The  ARN of the filter to apply to the returned recommendations. For
          more information, see Filtering Recommendations .

          When using this parameter, be sure the filter resource is ACTIVE .

       --filter-values (map)
          The values to use when filtering recommendations.  For  each  place-
          holder  parameter  in  your filter expression, provide the parameter
          name (in matching case) as a key and the filter value(s) as the cor-
          responding  value. Separate multiple values for one parameter with a
          comma.

          For filter expressions that use an INCLUDE element to include items,
          you  must  provide values for all parameters that are defined in the
          expression. For filters with expressions that use an EXCLUDE element
          to exclude items, you can omit the filter-values .In this case, Ama-
          zon Personalize doesn't use that portion of the expression to filter
          recommendations.

          For  more  information,  see Filtering recommendations and user seg-
          ments .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --recommender-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recommender to use to get rec-
          ommendations.  Provide  a  recommender  ARN  if you created a Domain
          dataset group with a recommender for a domain use case.

       --promotions (list)
          The promotions to apply to the recommendation request.  A  promotion
          defines  additional business rules that apply to a configurable sub-
          set of recommended items.

          (structure)
              Contains information on a promotion. A promotion  defines  addi-
              tional  business  rules  that  apply to a configurable subset of
              recommended items.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the promotion.

              percentPromotedItems -> (integer)
                 The percentage of recommended items to  apply  the  promotion
                 to.

              filterArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the filter used by the pro-
                 motion. This filter defines the criteria for promoted  items.
                 For more information, see Promotion filters .

              filterValues -> (map)
                 The  values to use when promoting items. For each placeholder
                 parameter in your promotion's filter expression, provide  the
                 parameter  name  (in  matching  case) as a key and the filter
                 value(s) as the corresponding value. Separate multiple values
                 for one parameter with a comma.

                 For filter expressions that use an INCLUDE element to include
                 items, you must provide values for all  parameters  that  are
                 defined  in the expression. For filters with expressions that
                 use an EXCLUDE element to exclude items,  you  can  omit  the
                 filter-values  . In this case, Amazon Personalize doesn't use
                 that portion of the expression to filter recommendations.

                 For more information on creating filters, see Filtering  rec-
                 ommendations and user segments .

                 key -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,percentPromotedItems=integer,filterArn=string,filterValues={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "percentPromotedItems": integer,
              "filterArn": "string",
              "filterValues": {"string": "string"
                ...}
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
