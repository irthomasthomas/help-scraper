       content types if the event has occurred during the chat session:

       o application/vnd.amazonaws.connect.event.participant.left

       o application/vnd.amazonaws.connect.event.participant.joined

       o application/vnd.amazonaws.connect.event.chat.ended

       o application/vnd.amazonaws.connect.event.transfer.succeeded

       o application/vnd.amazonaws.connect.event.transfer.failed

          fault: BACKWARD when no  StartPosition  is  provided,  FORWARD  with

              The ID of the message or event where to start.

          AbsoluteTime -> (string)
              The time in ISO format where to start.

              It's specified in ISO 8601 format: yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss.SSSZ. For

              The start position of the most recent message where you want  to
              start.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Id=string,AbsoluteTime=string,MostRecent=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Id": "string",

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON

       the string will be taken literally.

       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
