OPTIONS
       --member-account-id (string)
          (Discontinued) The ID of the Amazon  Macie  Classic  member  account
          whose  resources  you  want  to remove from being monitored by Macie
          Classic.

       --associated-s3-resources (list)
          (Discontinued) The S3 resources (buckets or prefixes) that you  want
          to  remove from being monitored and classified by Amazon Macie Clas-
          sic.

          (structure)
              (Discontinued) Contains information about the S3 resource.  This
              data  type  is  used  as  a  request parameter in the Disassoci-
              ateS3Resources action and can be used as a response parameter in
              the AssociateS3Resources and UpdateS3Resources actions.

              bucketName -> (string)
                 (Discontinued) The name of the S3 bucket.

              prefix -> (string)
                 (Discontinued) The prefix of the S3 bucket.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bucketName=string,prefix=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "bucketName": "string",
              "prefix": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
