       Shorthand Syntax:

          bucketName=string,prefix=string,classificationTypeUpdate={oneTime=string,continuous=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "bucketName": "string",
              "prefix": "string",
              "classificationTypeUpdate": {
                "oneTime": "FULL"|"NONE",
                "continuous": "FULL"
              }
            }
            ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
