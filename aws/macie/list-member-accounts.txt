LIST-MEMBER-ACCOUNTS()                                  LIST-MEMBER-ACCOUNTS()



NAME
       list-member-accounts -

DESCRIPTION
       (Discontinued)  Lists  all Amazon Macie Classic member accounts for the
       current Macie Classic administrator account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-member-accounts is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: memberAccounts

SYNOPSIS
            list-member-accounts
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       memberAccounts -> (list)
          (Discontinued)  A  list  of the Amazon Macie Classic member accounts
          returned by the action. The current Macie Classic administrator  ac-

                 (Discontinued) The Amazon Web Services account ID of the Ama-
                 zon Macie Classic member account.

       nextToken -> (string)
          (Discontinued)  When  a response is generated, if there is more data
          to be listed, this parameter is present in the response and contains
          the value to use for the nextToken parameter in a subsequent pagina-
          tion request. If there is no more data to be listed, this  parameter
          is set to null.
