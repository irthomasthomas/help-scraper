OPTIONS
       --data-location-constraint (string)
          Specifies  a  high-level  geographical location constraint for where
          your resilience policy data can be stored.

          Possible values:

          o AnyLocation

          o SameContinent

          o SameCountry

       --policy (map)
          The type of resiliency policy to be created, including the  recovery
          time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) in seconds.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Defines a failure policy.

              rpoInSecs -> (integer)
                 The Recovery Point Objective (RPO), in seconds.

              rtoInSecs -> (integer)
                 The Recovery Time Objective (RTO), in seconds.

       Shorthand Syntax:

            KeyName1=rpoInSecs=integer,rtoInSecs=integer,KeyName2=rpoInSecs=integer,rtoInSecs=integer

          Where valid key names are:
            Software
            Hardware
            AZ
            Region

       JSON Syntax:

          {"Software"|"Hardware"|"AZ"|"Region": {
                "rpoInSecs": integer,
                "rtoInSecs": integer
              }
            ...}

       --policy-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resiliency policy. The format
          for this ARN is: arn:partition :resiliencehub:region  :account  :re-
          siliency-policy/policy-id  .  For  more  information about ARNs, see
          Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference guide.

       --policy-description (string)
          The description for the policy.

       --policy-name (string)
          The name of the policy

       --tier (string)
          The tier for this resiliency policy, ranging from the highest sever-
          ity (MissionCritical ) to lowest (NonCritical ).

          Possible values:

          o MissionCritical

          o Critical

          o Important

          o CoreServices

          o NonCritical

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
