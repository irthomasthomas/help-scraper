SYNOPSIS
            update-app
          --app-arn <value>
          [--assessment-schedule <value>]
          [--clear-resiliency-policy-arn | --no-clear-resiliency-policy-arn]
          [--description <value>]
          [--policy-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the application. The format for
          this   ARN   is:   arn:partition   :resiliencehub:region    :account
          :app/app-id  .  For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource
          Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

       --assessment-schedule (string)
          Assessment execution schedule with 'Daily' or 'Disabled' values.

          Possible values:

          o Disabled

          o Daily

       --clear-resiliency-policy-arn | --no-clear-resiliency-policy-arn (bool-
       ean)
          Specifies if the resiliency policy ARN should be cleared.

       --description (string)
          The optional description for an app.

       --policy-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resiliency policy. The format
          for this ARN is: arn:partition :resiliencehub:region  :account  :re-
          siliency-policy/policy-id  .  For  more  information about ARNs, see
          Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       app -> (structure)
          The  specified  application,  returned as an object with details in-
          cluding compliance status, creation  time,  description,  resiliency
          score, and more.

          appArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the application. The format
              for this ARN is:  arn:partition  :resiliencehub:region  :account
              :app/app-id  .  For  more information about ARNs, see Amazon Re-
              source Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

          assessmentSchedule -> (string)
              Assessment execution schedule with 'Daily' or 'Disabled' values.

          complianceStatus -> (string)
              The current status of compliance for the resiliency policy.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp for when the app was created.

          description -> (string)
              The optional description for an app.

          lastAppComplianceEvaluationTime -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp for the most recent compliance evaluation.

          lastResiliencyScoreEvaluationTime -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp for the most recent resiliency score evaluation.

          name -> (string)
              The name for the application.

          policyArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  resiliency  policy.  The
              format for this ARN is: arn:partition :resiliencehub:region :ac-
              count :resiliency-policy/policy-id . For more information  about
              ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Refer-
              ence .

          resiliencyScore -> (double)
              The current resiliency score for the application.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the action.

          tags -> (map)
