NAME
       list-apps -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists your Resilience Hub applications.

       NOTE:
          You can filter applications using only one filter at a time or with-
          out using any filter. If you try to filter applications using multi-
          ple filters, you will get the following error:
              An   error   occurred  (ValidationException)  when  calling  the
              ListApps operation: Only one filter is supported for this opera-
              tion.

OPTIONS
       --app-arn (string)
          Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the Resilience Hub application. The
          format for this ARN is: arn:partition :resiliencehub:region :account
          :app/app-id  .  For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource
          Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference guide.

       --aws-application-arn (string)
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of Resource Groups group  that  is  inte-
          grated  with  an AppRegistry application. For more information about
          ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the  Amazon  Web  Services
          General Reference guide.

       --from-last-assessment-time (timestamp)
          Indicates the lower limit of the range that is used to filter appli-
          cations based on their last assessment times.

       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum number of results to include in the response.  If  more  re-
          sults exist than the specified MaxResults value, a token is included
          in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved.

       --name (string)
          The name for the one of the listed applications.

       --next-token (string)
          Null, or the token from a previous call to get the next set  of  re-
          sults.

       --reverse-order | --no-reverse-order (boolean)
          The application list is sorted based on the values of lastAppCompli-
          anceEvaluationTime field. By default, application list is sorted  in
          ascending  order.  To sort the application list in descending order,
          set this field to True .

       --to-last-assessment-time (timestamp)
          Indicates the upper limit of the range that is used  to  filter  the
          applications based on their last assessment times.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
