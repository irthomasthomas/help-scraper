OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum  number  of  results to include in the response. If more re-
          sults exist than the specified MaxResults value, a token is included
          in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved.

       --next-token (string)
          Null,  or  the token from a previous call to get the next set of re-
          sults.

       --policy-name (string)
          The name of the policy

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          Token  for the next set of results, or null if there are no more re-
          sults.

       resiliencyPolicies -> (list)
          The resiliency policies for the Resilience Hub applications.

          (structure)
              Defines a resiliency policy.

              NOTE:
                 Resilience Hub allows you to provide  a  value  of  zero  for
                 rtoInSecs and rpoInSecs of your resiliency policy. But, while
                 assessing your application, the  lowest  possible  assessment
                 result  is  near  zero.  Hence, if you provide value zero for
                 rtoInSecs and rpoInSecs , the estimated workload RTO and  es-
                 timated workload RPO result will be near zero and the Compli-
                 ance status for  your  application  will  be  set  to  Policy
                 breached .

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 Date and time when the resiliency policy was created.

              dataLocationConstraint -> (string)
                 Specifies  a  high-level geographical location constraint for
                 where your resilience policy data can be stored.

              estimatedCostTier -> (string)
                 Specifies the estimated cost tier of the resiliency policy.

              policy -> (map)
                 The resiliency policy.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Defines a failure policy.

                     rpoInSecs -> (integer)
                        Recovery Point Objective (RPO) in seconds.

                     rtoInSecs -> (integer)
                        Recovery Time Objective (RTO) in seconds.

              policyArn -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resiliency policy. The for-
                 mat for this ARN is: arn:partition :resiliencehub:region :ac-
                 count :resiliency-policy/policy-id  .  For  more  information
                 about  ARNs,  see  Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the Amazon
                 Web Services General Reference guide.

              policyDescription -> (string)
                 The description for the policy.

              policyName -> (string)
                 The name of the policy

              tags -> (map)
                 Tags assigned to the resource. A tag is a label that you  as-
                 sign to an Amazon Web Services resource. Each tag consists of
                 a key/value pair.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              tier -> (string)
                 The tier for this resiliency policy, ranging from the highest
                 severity (MissionCritical ) to lowest (NonCritical ).
