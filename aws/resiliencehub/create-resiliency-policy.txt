CREATE-RESILIENCY-POLICY()                          CREATE-RESILIENCY-POLICY()



NAME
       create-resiliency-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a resiliency policy for an application.

       NOTE:
          Resilience  Hub  allows you to provide a value of zero for rtoInSecs
          and rpoInSecs of your resiliency policy. But, while  assessing  your
          application,  the  lowest  possible  assessment result is near zero.
          Hence, if you provide value zero for rtoInSecs and rpoInSecs  ,  the
          estimated  workload  RTO  and  estimated workload RPO result will be
          near zero and the Compliance status for your application will be set
          to Policy breached .

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Used for an idempotency token. A client token is a unique, case-sen-
          sitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters. You should not reuse the
          same client token for other API requests.

       --data-location-constraint (string)
          Specifies  a  high-level  geographical location constraint for where
          your resilience policy data can be stored.

          Possible values:

          o AnyLocation

          o SameContinent

          o SameCountry

       --policy (map)
          The type of resiliency policy to be created, including the  recovery
          time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) in seconds.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Defines a failure policy.

              rpoInSecs -> (integer)

                 Recovery Time Objective (RTO) in seconds.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Where valid key names are:
            Software
            Hardware
            AZ
            Region

       JSON Syntax:

          {"Software"|"Hardware"|"AZ"|"Region": {
                "rpoInSecs": integer,
                "rtoInSecs": integer
              }

       --tags (map)
          Tags  assigned  to the resource. A tag is a label that you assign to
          an Amazon Web Services resource. Each tag consists  of  a  key/value
          pair.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --tier (string)
          The tier for this resiliency policy, ranging from the highest sever-
          ity (MissionCritical ) to lowest (NonCritical ).

          Possible values:

          o MissionCritical

          o Critical

          o CoreServices

          o NonCritical

          o NotApplicable

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
