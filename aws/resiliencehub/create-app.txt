CREATE-APP()                                                      CREATE-APP()



NAME
       create-app -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an Resilience Hub application. An Resilience Hub application is
       a collection of Amazon Web Services resources structured to prevent and
       recover  Amazon Web Services application disruptions. To describe a Re-
       silience Hub application, you provide an  application  name,  resources
       from  one  or  more  CloudFormation  stacks, Resource Groups, Terraform
       state files, AppRegistry applications, and  an  appropriate  resiliency
       policy.  In  addition,  you  can also add resources that are located on
       Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) clusters as optional re-
       sources.  For  more information about the number of resources supported
       per application, see Service quotas .

       After you create an Resilience Hub application, you publish it so  that
       you can run a resiliency assessment on it. You can then use recommenda-
       tions from the assessment to improve resiliency by running another  as-
       sessment,  comparing  results, and then iterating the process until you
       achieve your goals for recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point
       objective (RPO).

          crossAccountRoleArns -> (list)
              Defines a list of role Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to  be  used

              while importing resources and assessing your application.

              NOTE:

                 o These ARNs are required only when  your  resources  are  in
                   other  accounts  and  you have different role name in these
                   accounts. Else, the invoker role name will be used  in  the
                   other accounts.

                 o You  must  have iam:passRole permission for this role while
                   creating or updating the application.

                 o Currently, invokerRoleName accepts only  [A-Za-z0-9_+=,.@-]
                   characters.

          type -> (string)
              Defines how Resilience Hub scans your resources. It can scan for
              the resources by using a pre-existing role in  your  Amazon  Web
              Services account, or by using the credentials of the current IAM
              user.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          crossAccountRoleArns=string,string,invokerRoleName=string,type=string

          erence guide.

       --tags (map)
          Tags assigned to the resource. A tag is a label that you  assign  to

          pair.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-

       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
