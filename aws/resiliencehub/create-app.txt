CREATE-APP()                                                      CREATE-APP()



NAME
       create-app -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an AWS Resilience Hub application. An AWS Resilience Hub appli-
       cation is a collection of Amazon Web Services resources  structured  to
       prevent and recover Amazon Web Services application disruptions. To de-
       scribe a AWS Resilience Hub application,  you  provide  an  application
       name, resources from one or moreup to fiveCloudFormation stacks, and an
       appropriate resiliency policy.

       After you create an AWS Resilience Hub application, you publish  it  so
       that you can run a resiliency assessment on it. You can then use recom-
       mendations from the assessment to improve resiliency by running another
       assessment, comparing results, and then iterating the process until you
       achieve your goals for recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point
       objective (RPO).

OPTIONS
       --assessment-schedule (string)
          Assessment execution schedule with 'Daily' or 'Disabled' values.

          Possible values:

          o Disabled

          o Daily

       --client-token (string)
          Used for an idempotency token. A client token is a unique, case-sen-
          sitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters. You should not reuse the
          same client token for other API requests.

       --description (string)
          The optional description for an app.

       --name (string)
          The name for the application.

       --policy-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resiliency policy. The format
          for this ARN is: arn:partition :resiliencehub:region  :account  :re-
          siliency-policy/policy-id  .  For  more  information about ARNs, see
          Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference guide.

       --tags (map)
          The tags assigned to the resource. A tag is a label that you  assign
          to an Amazon Web Services resource. Each tag consists of a key/value
          pair.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
