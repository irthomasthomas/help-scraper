OPTIONS
       --assessment-arn (string)
          Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the assessment. The format for this
          ARN is: arn:partition  :resiliencehub:region  :account  :app-assess-
          ment/app-id  .  For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource
          Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference guide.

       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum number of results to include in the response.  If  more  re-
          sults exist than the specified MaxResults value, a token is included
          in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved.

       --next-token (string)
          Null, or the token from a previous call to get the next set  of  re-
          sults.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                     component after running an assessment.

                     For example, if the score is 25 points, it indicates  the
                     overall score of your application generated by Resilience
                     Hub after running an assessment.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Resiliency score of each scoring component.  For  more
                        information  about  scoring component, see Calculating
                        resiliency score .

                        excludedCount -> (long)
                            Number of recommendations that were excluded  from
                            the assessment.

                            For  example, if the excludedCount for Alarms cov-
                            erage scoring component is 7, it indicates that  7
                            Amazon CloudWatch alarms are excluded from the as-
                            sessment.

                        outstandingCount -> (long)
                            Number of recommendations that must be implemented
                            to obtain the maximum possible score for the scor-
                            ing component. For SOPs, alarms, and tests,  these
                            are the number of recommendations that must be im-
                            plemented. For compliance, these are the number of
                            Application  Components that have breached the re-
                            siliency policy.

                            For example, if the  outstandingCount  for  Alarms
                            coverage scoring component is 5, it indicates that
                            5 Amazon CloudWatch alarms need to be  implemented
                            to achieve the maximum possible score.

                        possibleScore -> (double)
                            Maximum  possible  score  that can be obtained for
                            the scoring component.

                            For example, if the possibleScore is 20 points, it
                            indicates  the  maximum  possible  score  you  can
                            achieve for the scoring component when you  run  a
                            new  assessment  after  implementing  all  the Re-
                            silience Hub recommendations.

                        score -> (double)
                            Resiliency score points given for the scoring com-
                            ponent.  The score is always less than or equal to
                            the possibleScore .

                 disruptionScore -> (map)
                     The disruption score for a valid key.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (double)

                 score -> (double)
                     The outage score for a valid key.

              status -> (string)
                 Status of the action.

       nextToken -> (string)
          Token for the next set of results, or null if there are no more  re-
          sults.
