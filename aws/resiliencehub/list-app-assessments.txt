OPTIONS
       --app-arn (string)
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Resilience  Hub  application.  The
          format for this ARN is: arn:partition :resiliencehub:region :account
          :app/app-id . For more information about ARNs, see  Amazon  Resource
          Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference guide.

       --assessment-name (string)
          The name for the assessment.

       --assessment-status (list)
          The current status of the assessment for the resiliency policy.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Pending
            InProgress
            Failed
            Success

       --compliance-status (string)
          The current status of compliance for the resiliency policy.

          Possible values:

          o PolicyBreached

          o PolicyMet

          o NotApplicable

          o MissingPolicy

       --invoker (string)
          Specifies  the  entity  that invoked a specific assessment, either a
          User or the System .

          Possible values:

          o User

          o System

       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum number of results to include in the response.  If  more  re-
          sults exist than the specified MaxResults value, a token is included
          in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved.

       --next-token (string)
          Null, or the token from a previous call to get the next set  of  re-
          sults.

       --reverse-order | --no-reverse-order (boolean)
          The  default is to sort by ascending startTime . To sort by descend-
          ing startTime , set reverseOrder to true .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
