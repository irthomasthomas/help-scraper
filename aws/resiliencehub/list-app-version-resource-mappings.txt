       list-app-version-resource-mappings -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  how  the  resources in an application version are mapped/sourced
       from. Mappings can be  physical  resource  identifiers,  CloudFormation
       stacks, resource-groups, or an application registry app.

OPTIONS
       --app-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the AWS Resilience Hub applica-
          tion. The format for this ARN is:  arn:partition  :resiliencehub:re-
          gion  :account  :app/app-id  .  For more information about ARNs, see
          Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference guide.

       --app-version (string)
          The version of the application.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to include in the  response.  If  more
          results  exist  than  the specified MaxResults value, a token is in-
          cluded in the response so that the  remaining  results  can  be  re-
          trieved.

       --next-token (string)
          Null,  or  the token from a previous call to get the next set of re-
          sults.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          The  token for the next set of results, or null if there are no more
          results.

       resourceMappings -> (list)
          Mappings used to map logical resources from the template to physical
          resources. You can use the mapping type CFN_STACK if the application
          template uses a logical stack name. Or you can  map  individual  re-
          sources  by using the mapping type RESOURCE . We recommend using the
          mapping type CFN_STACK if the application is backed by a CloudForma-
          tion stack.

              Defines a resource mapping.
