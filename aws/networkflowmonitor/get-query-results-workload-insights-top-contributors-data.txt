NAME
       get-query-results-workload-insights-top-contributors-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Return  the data for a query with the Network Flow Monitor query inter-
       face. Specify the query that you want to return results for by  provid-
       ing a query ID and a scope ID. This query returns data for the top con-
       tributors for workload insights. Workload insights provide a high level
       view of network flow performance data collected by agents for a scope.

       Create  a  query ID for this call by calling the corresponding API call
       to start the query, StartQueryWorkloadInsightsTopContributorsData . Use
       the scope ID that was returned for your account by CreateScope .

       Top  contributors  in  Network  Flow Monitor are network flows with the
       highest values for a specific metric type,  related  to  a  scope  (for
       workload insights) or a monitor.

       The  top  contributor network flows overall for a specific metric type,
       for example, the number of retransmissions.

       get-query-results-workload-insights-top-contributors-data  is  a  pagi-
       nated  operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve
       the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing
       the  --no-paginate  argument.  When using --output text and the --query
       argument on a paginated response, the  --query  argument  must  extract
       data from the results of the following query expressions: datapoints

OPTIONS
       --scope-id (string)
          The identifier for the scope that includes the resources you want to
          get data results for. A scope ID is an internally-generated  identi-
          fier that includes all the resources for a specific root account.

       --query-id (string)
          The  identifier for the query. A query ID is an internally-generated
          identifier for a specific query returned from an API call to start a
          query.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          The units for a metric returned by the query.

       datapoints -> (list)
          The datapoints returned by the query.

          (structure)
              A data point for a top contributor network flow in a scope. Net-
              work  Flow  Monitor  returns information about the network flows
              with the top values for each metric type, which are  called  top
              contributors.

                 The label identifying the data point.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results. You receive this token from a
          previous call.
