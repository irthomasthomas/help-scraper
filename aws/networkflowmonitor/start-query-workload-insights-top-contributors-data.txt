NAME
       start-query-workload-insights-top-contributors-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Return  the data for a query with the Network Flow Monitor query inter-
       face. Specify the query that you want to return results for by  provid-
       ing a query ID and a scope ID. This query returns data for the top con-
       tributors for workload insights. Workload insights provide a high level
       view of network flow performance data collected by agents for a scope.

       A  query ID is returned from an API call to start a query of a specific
       type; for example

       Top contributors in Network Flow Monitor are  network  flows  with  the
       highest  values  for  a  specific  metric type, related to a scope (for
       workload insights) or a monitor.

       The top contributor network flows overall for a specific  metric  type,
       for example, the number of retransmissions.

OPTIONS
       --scope-id (string)
          The identifier for the scope that includes the resources you want to
          get data results for. A scope ID is an internally-generated  identi-
          fier that includes all the resources for a specific root account.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The timestamp that is the date and time beginning of the period that
          you want to retrieve results for with your query.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The timestamp that is the date and time end of the period  that  you
          want to retrieve results for with your query.

       --metric-name (string)
          The metric that you want to query top contributors for. That is, you
          can specify this metric to return the top contributor network flows,
          for  this  type  of  metric, for a monitor and (optionally) within a
          specific category, such as network flows between Availability Zones.

          Possible values:

          o TIMEOUTS

          o RETRANSMISSIONS

          o DATA_TRANSFERRED

       --destination-category (string)
          The destination category for a top contributors.  Destination  cate-
          gories can be one of the following:

          o INTRA_AZ  :  Top  contributor network flows within a single Avail-
            ability Zone

          o INTER_AZ : Top  contributor  network  flows  between  Availability
            Zones

          o INTER_VPC : Top contributor network flows between VPCs

          o AWS_SERVICES : Top contributor network flows to or from Amazon Web
            Services services

          o UNCLASSIFIED : Top contributor network flows that do  not  have  a
            bucket classification

          Possible values:

          o INTRA_AZ

          o INTER_AZ

          o INTER_VPC

          o UNCLASSIFIED

          o AMAZON_S3

          o AMAZON_DYNAMODB

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       queryId -> (string)
          The  identifier for the query. A query ID is an internally-generated
          identifier for a specific query returned from an API call to start a
          query.
