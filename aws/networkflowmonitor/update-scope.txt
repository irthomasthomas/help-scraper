OPTIONS
       --scope-id (string)
          The identifier for the scope that includes the resources you want to
          get  data results for. A scope ID is an internally-generated identi-
          fier that includes all the resources for a specific root account.

       --resources-to-add (list)
          A list of resources to add to a scope.

          (structure)
              A target resource in a scope. The resource is  identified  by  a
              Region and a target identifier, which includes a target ID and a
              target type.

              targetIdentifier -> (structure)
                 A target identifier is a pair of identifying information  for
                 a  resource that is included in a target. A target identifier
                 includes the target ID and the target type.

                 targetId -> (tagged union structure)
                     The identifier for a target.

                     NOTE:
                        This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the fol-
                        lowing top level keys can be set: accountId.

                     accountId -> (string)
                        The identifier for the account for a target.

                 targetType -> (string)
                     The  type  of a target. A target type is currently always
                     ACCOUNT because a target is currently a single Amazon Web
                     Services account.

              region -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web Services Region where the target resource is
                 located.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
