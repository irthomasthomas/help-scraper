NAME
       get-query-status-workload-insights-top-contributors-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  current  status  of  a query for the Network Flow Monitor
       query interface, for a specified query ID and monitor.  This  call  re-
       turns  the  query status for the top contributors data for workload in-
       sights.

       When you start a query, use this call to check the status of the  query
       to  make  sure that it has has SUCCEEDED before you review the results.
       Use the same query ID that you used for the corresponding API  call  to
       start the query, StartQueryWorkloadInsightsTopContributorsData .

       Top  contributors  in  Network  Flow Monitor are network flows with the
       highest values for a specific metric type,  related  to  a  scope  (for
       workload insights) or a monitor.

       The  top  contributor network flows overall for a specific metric type,
       for example, the number of retransmissions.

OPTIONS
       --scope-id (string)
          The identifier for the scope that includes the resources you want to
          get  data results for. A scope ID is an internally-generated identi-
          fier that includes all the resources for a specific root account.  A
          scope ID is returned from a CreateScope API call.

       --query-id (string)
          The  identifier for the query. A query ID is an internally-generated
          identifier for a specific query returned from an API call to start a
          query.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the

       seconds.
