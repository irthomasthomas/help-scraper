GET-QUERY-RESULTS-WORKLOGET-QUERY-RESULTS-WORKLOAD-INSIGHTS-TOP-CONTRIBUTORS()



NAME
       get-query-results-workload-insights-top-contributors -

DESCRIPTION
       Return  the data for a query with the Network Flow Monitor query inter-
       face. You specify the query that you want to return results for by pro-
       viding  a  query ID and a monitor name. This query returns the top con-
       tributors for a specific monitor.

       Create a query ID for this call by calling the corresponding  API  call
       to start the query, StartQueryWorkloadInsightsTopContributors . Use the
       scope ID that was returned for your account by CreateScope .

       Top contributors in Network Flow Monitor are  network  flows  with  the
       highest  values  for  a  specific  metric type, related to a scope (for
       workload insights) or a monitor.

       get-query-results-workload-insights-top-contributors is a paginated op-
       eration.  Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the en-
       tire data set of results. You can disable pagination by  providing  the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment on a paginated response, the --query argument  must  extract  data
       from the results of the following query expressions: topContributors

OPTIONS
       --scope-id (string)
          The identifier for the scope that includes the resources you want to
          get data results for. A scope ID is an internally-generated  identi-
          fier that includes all the resources for a specific root account.

       --query-id (string)
          The  identifier for the query. A query ID is an internally-generated
          identifier for a specific query returned from an API call to start a
          query.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
