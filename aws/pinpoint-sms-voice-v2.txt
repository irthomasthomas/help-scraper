          Regional availability

       The Amazon Pinpoint SMS and Voice, version 2 API Reference is available
       in  several Amazon Web Services Regions and it provides an endpoint for
       each of these Regions. For a list of  all  the  Regions  and  endpoints
       where  the  API is currently available, see Amazon Web Services Service
       Endpoints and Amazon Pinpoint endpoints and quotas in  the  Amazon  Web
       Services General Reference. To learn more about Amazon Web Services Re-
       gions, see Managing Amazon Web Services Regions in the Amazon Web  Ser-
       vices General Reference.

       In  each  Region,  Amazon  Web Services maintains multiple Availability
       Zones. These Availability  Zones  are  physically  isolated  from  each
       other,  but  are  united  by private, low-latency, high-throughput, and
       highly redundant network connections. These Availability  Zones  enable
       us  to  provide  very high levels of availability and redundancy, while
       also minimizing latency. To learn more about the number of Availability
       Zones that are available in each Region, see Amazon Web Services Global
       Infrastructure.
