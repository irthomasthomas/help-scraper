          Regional availability

       The AWS End User Messaging SMS and Voice version  2  API  Reference  is
       available  in  several  Amazon  Web Services Regions and it provides an
       endpoint for each of these Regions. For a list of all the  Regions  and
       endpoints where the API is currently available, see Amazon Web Services
       Service Endpoints and Amazon Pinpoint endpoints and quotas in the  Ama-
       zon Web Services General Reference. To learn more about Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Regions, see Managing Amazon Web Services Regions in  the  Amazon
       Web Services General Reference.

       In  each  Region,  Amazon  Web Services maintains multiple Availability
       Zones. These Availability  Zones  are  physically  isolated  from  each
       other,  but  are  united  by private, low-latency, high-throughput, and
       highly redundant network connections. These Availability  Zones  enable
       us  to  provide  very high levels of availability and redundancy, while
       also minimizing latency. To learn more about the number of Availability
       Zones that are available in each Region, see Amazon Web Services Global
       Infrastructure.
