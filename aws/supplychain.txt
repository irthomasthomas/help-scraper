NAME
       supplychain -

DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Supply Chain is a cloud-based application that works with your en-
       terprise resource planning (ERP) and supply chain  management  systems.
       Using  AWS  Supply  Chain,  you can connect and extract your inventory,
       supply, and demand related data from existing ERP or supply chain  sys-
       tems into a single data model.

       The  AWS Supply Chain API supports configuration data import for Supply
       Planning.

       All AWS Supply chain API operations are Amazon-authenticated  and  cer-
       tificate-signed. They not only require the use of the AWS SDK, but also
       allow for the exclusive use of AWS Identity and Access Management users
       and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission policies.
