OPTIONS
       --vehicle-name (string)
          The ID of the vehicle to retrieve information about.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

          hicle.

          State templates associated with the vehicle.

          (structure)
              The  state  template  associated with a vehicle. State templates
              contain state properties, which are signals  that  belong  to  a
              signal  catalog that is synchronized between the Amazon Web Ser-
              vices IoT FleetWise Edge and the Amazon Web Services Cloud.

              stateTemplateUpdateStrategy -> (tagged union structure)
                 The  update strategy for the state template. Vehicles associ-
                 ated with the state template can stream telemetry  data  with
                 either an onChange or periodic update strategy.

                 periodic -> (structure)
                     Vehicles  associated  with the state template will stream

                        value -> (integer)
                            A number of time units.

                 onChange -> (structure)
                     Vehicles associated with the state template  will  stream
                     telemetry data when there is a change.

       creationTime -> (timestamp)
          The  time the vehicle was created in seconds since epoch (January 1,
