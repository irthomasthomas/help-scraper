OPTIONS
       --vehicles (list)
          A  list of information about each vehicle to create. For more infor-
          mation, see the API data type.

          (structure)
              Information about the vehicle to create.

              vehicleName -> (string)
                 The unique ID of the vehicle to create.

              modelManifestArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the vehicle model (model manifest) to  create  the
                 vehicle from.

              decoderManifestArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a decoder manifest associ-
                 ated with the vehicle to create.

              attributes -> (map)
                 Static information about a vehicle in a key-value  pair.  For
                 example: "engine Type" : "v6"

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              associationBehavior -> (string)
                 An  option to create a new Amazon Web Services IoT thing when
                 creating a vehicle, or to validate an existing thing as a ve-
                 hicle.

              tags -> (list)
                 Metadata which can be used to manage the vehicle.

                 (structure)
                     A  set of key/value pairs that are used to manage the re-
                     source.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The tag's key.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The tag's value.

              stateTemplates -> (list)
                 Associate state templates to track the state of the  vehicle.
                 State  templates  determine  which signal updates the vehicle

                 (structure)
                     The state template associated with a vehicle. State  tem-

                     belong to a signal catalog that is  synchronized  between
                     the Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise Edge and the Amazon
                     Web Services Cloud.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
