CREATE-CAMPAIGN()                                            CREATE-CAMPAIGN()



NAME
       create-campaign -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an orchestration of data collection rules. The Amazon Web Ser-
       vices IoT FleetWise Edge Agent software running in vehicles  uses  cam-
       paigns  to  decide  how  to collect and transfer data to the cloud. You
       create campaigns in the cloud. After you  or  your  team  approve  cam-
       paigns, Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise automatically deploys them to
       vehicles.

       For more information, see Collect and transfer data with  campaigns  in
       the Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise Developer Guide .

       --signals-to-collect (list)
          (Optional) A list of information about signals to collect.

          (structure)
              Information about a signal.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the signal.

              maxSampleCount -> (long)

                 The  minimum  duration  of time (in milliseconds) between two
                 triggering events to collect data.

                 NOTE:
                     If a signal changes often, you might want to collect data
                     at a slower rate.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,maxSampleCount=long,minimumSamplingIntervalMs=long ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "maxSampleCount": long,
              "minimumSamplingIntervalMs": long
            }
            ...
          ]

       --collection-scheme (tagged union structure)
          The  data  collection  scheme  associated with the campaign. You can
          specify a scheme that collects data based on time or an event.

          NOTE:
              This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following  top
              level  keys  can  be  set: timeBasedCollectionScheme, condition-
              BasedCollectionScheme.

          timeBasedCollectionScheme -> (structure)
              Information about a collection scheme that uses a time period to
              decide how often to collect data.

              periodMs -> (long)
                 The time period (in milliseconds) to decide how often to col-
                 lect data. For example, if the time period  is  60000  ,  the
                 Edge Agent software collects data once every minute.

          conditionBasedCollectionScheme -> (structure)
              Information about a collection scheme that uses a simple logical
              expression to recognize what data to collect.

              expression -> (string)
                 The logical expression used to recognize what  data  to  col-
                 lect.  For example, $variable.`Vehicle.OutsideAirTemperature`
                 >= 105.0 .

              minimumTriggerIntervalMs -> (long)
                 The minimum duration of time between two triggering events to
                 collect data, in milliseconds.

                 NOTE:
                     If a signal changes often, you might want to collect data
                     at a slower rate.

              triggerMode -> (string)
                 Whether to collect data for all triggering events (ALWAYS  ).
                 Specify  (RISING_EDGE  ),  or specify only when the condition
                 first  evaluates  to  false.  For  example,   triggering   on
                 "AirbagDeployed";  Users aren't interested on triggering when
                 the airbag is already exploded;  they  only  care  about  the
                 change from not deployed => deployed.

              conditionLanguageVersion -> (integer)
                 Specifies the version of the conditional expression language.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          timeBasedCollectionScheme={periodMs=long},conditionBasedCollectionScheme={expression=string,minimumTriggerIntervalMs=long,triggerMode=string,conditionLanguageVersion=integer}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "timeBasedCollectionScheme": {
              "periodMs": long
            },
            "conditionBasedCollectionScheme": {
              "expression": "string",
              "minimumTriggerIntervalMs": long,
              "triggerMode": "ALWAYS"|"RISING_EDGE",
              "conditionLanguageVersion": integer
            }
          }

       --data-extra-dimensions (list)
          (Optional)  A  list  of  vehicle attributes to associate with a cam-
          paign.

          Enrich the data with specified vehicle attributes. For example,  add
          make  and  model to the campaign, and Amazon Web Services IoT Fleet-
          Wise will associate the data with those attributes as dimensions  in
          Amazon  Timestream.  You  can  then  query the data against make and
          model .

          Default: An empty array

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          Metadata that can be used to manage the campaign.

          (structure)

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag's key.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag's value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --data-destination-configs (list)
          The destination where the campaign sends data.  You  can  choose  to
          send data to be stored in Amazon S3 or Amazon Timestream.

          Amazon S3 optimizes the cost of data storage and provides additional
          mechanisms to use vehicle data, such as data lakes, centralized data
          storage,  data  processing pipelines, and analytics. Amazon Web Ser-
          vices IoT FleetWise supports at-least-once file delivery to S3. Your
          vehicle data is stored on multiple Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise
          servers for redundancy and high availability.

          You can use Amazon Timestream to  access  and  analyze  time  series
          data,  and Timestream to query vehicle data so that you can identify
          trends and patterns.

          (tagged union structure)
              The destination where the Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise cam-
              paign sends data. You can send data to be stored in Amazon S3 or
              Amazon Timestream.

              NOTE:
                 This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of  the  following
                 top level keys can be set: s3Config, timestreamConfig.

              s3Config -> (structure)
                 The Amazon S3 bucket where the Amazon Web Services IoT Fleet-
                 Wise campaign sends data.

                 bucketArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon S3 bucket.

                 dataFormat -> (string)
                     Specify the format that files are saved in the Amazon  S3
                     bucket.  You  can save files in an Apache Parquet or JSON
                     format.

                     o Parquet - Store data in a columnar storage file format.
                       Parquet  is optimal for fast data retrieval and can re-
                       duce costs. This option is selected by default.

                     o JSON - Store data in a standard  text-based  JSON  file
                       format.

                 storageCompressionFormat -> (string)
                     By  default,  stored  data is compressed as a .gzip file.
                     Compressed files have a reduced file size, which can  op-
                     timize the cost of data storage.

                 prefix -> (string)
                     (Optional)  Enter  an S3 bucket prefix. The prefix is the
                     string of characters after the bucket name and before the
                     object  name.  You  can  use  the prefix to organize data
                     stored in Amazon S3 buckets. For  more  information,  see
                     Organizing  objects  using  prefixes in the Amazon Simple
                     Storage Service User Guide .

                     By default, Amazon Web Services IoT  FleetWise  sets  the
                     prefix   processed-data/year=YY/month=MM/date=DD/hour=HH/
                     (in UTC) to data it delivers to Amazon S3. You can  enter
                     a  prefix  to append it to this default prefix. For exam-
                     ple, if you enter the prefix vehicles , the  prefix  will
                     be                                          vehicles/pro-
                     cessed-data/year=YY/month=MM/date=DD/hour=HH/ .

              timestreamConfig -> (structure)
                 The Amazon Timestream table where the campaign sends data.

                 timestreamTableArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Amazon  Timestream
                     table.

                 executionRoleArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution role
                     that grants Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise  permission
                     to deliver data to the Amazon Timestream table.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          s3Config={bucketArn=string,dataFormat=string,storageCompressionFormat=string,prefix=string},timestreamConfig={timestreamTableArn=string,executionRoleArn=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "s3Config": {
                "bucketArn": "string",
                "dataFormat": "JSON"|"PARQUET",
                "storageCompressionFormat": "NONE"|"GZIP",
                "prefix": "string"
              },
              "timestreamConfig": {
                "timestreamTableArn": "string",
                "executionRoleArn": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
