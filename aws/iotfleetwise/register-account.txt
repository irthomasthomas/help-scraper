       register-account -

DESCRIPTION
       WARNING:
              This API operation contains deprecated parameters. Register your
              account again without the Timestream resources parameter so that
              Amazon  Web  Services  IoT  FleetWise  can remove the Timestream
              metadata stored. You should then pass the data destination  into
              the CreateCampaign API operation.

              You  must  delete  any  existing campaigns that include an empty
              data destination before you register  your  account  again.  For
              more information, see the DeleteCampaign API operation.

              If you want to delete the Timestream inline policy from the ser-
              vice-linked role, such as to mitigate an overly permissive  pol-
              icy,  you  must first delete any existing campaigns. Then delete
              the service-linked role and register your account again  to  en-
              able    CloudWatch    metrics.   For   more   information,   see
              DeleteServiceLinkedRole in the Identity  and  Access  Management
              API Reference .

          <p>Registers  your  Amazon  Web  Services  account,  IAM, and Amazon
          Timestream resources so Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise can trans-
          fer your vehicle data to the Amazon Web Services Cloud. For more in-
          formation,    including    step-by-step    procedures,    see     <a

          Wise</a>.   </p>   <note>  <p>An  Amazon  Web  Services  account  is
          <b>not</b>    the    same    thing    as    a    "user."    An    <a

OPTIONS
       --timestream-resources (structure)
          The registered Amazon Timestream resources that Amazon Web  Services
          IoT FleetWise edge agent software can transfer your vehicle data to.

          timestreamDatabaseName -> (string)
              The name of the registered Amazon Timestream database.

          timestreamTableName -> (string)
              The name of the registered Amazon Timestream database table.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          timestreamDatabaseName=string,timestreamTableName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "timestreamDatabaseName": "string",
            "timestreamTableName": "string"
          }

       --iam-resources (structure)
          The  IAM  resource  that allows Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise to
          send data to Amazon Timestream.

          roleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM resource  that  allows
              Amazon  Web  Services  IoT  FleetWise  to  send  data  to Amazon
              Timestream.  For  example,   arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/SER-
              VICE-ROLE-ARN .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          roleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "roleArn": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
