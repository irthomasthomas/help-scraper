OPTIONS
       --vehicles (list)
          A  list of information about the vehicles to update. For more infor-
          mation, see the API data type.

          (structure)
              Information about the vehicle to update.

              vehicleName -> (string)
                 The unique ID of the vehicle to update.

              modelManifestArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the vehicle model (model manifest) associated with
                 the vehicle to update.

              decoderManifestArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  the signal decoder manifest associated with the
                 vehicle to update.

              attributes -> (map)
                 Static information about a vehicle in a key-value  pair.  For
                 example:
                     "engineType" : "1.3 L R2"

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              attributeUpdateMode -> (string)
                 The  method the specified attributes will update the existing
                 attributes on the vehicle. Use``Overwite`` to replace the ve-
                 hicle  attributes with the specified attributes. Or use Merge
                 to combine all attributes.

                 This is required if attributes are present in the input.

              stateTemplatesToAdd -> (list)
                 Associate additional state templates to track  the  state  of
                 the  vehicle.  State templates determine which signal updates
                 the vehicle sends to the cloud.

                 (structure)
                     The state template associated with a vehicle. State  tem-
                     plates  contain  state properties, which are signals that
                     belong to a signal catalog that is  synchronized  between
                     the Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise Edge and the Amazon
                     Web Services Cloud.

                     identifier -> (string)
                        A unique, service-generated identifier.

                     stateTemplateUpdateStrategy -> (tagged union structure)
                        The update strategy for the state  template.  Vehicles
                        associated  with the state template can stream teleme-
                        try data with either an onChange  or  periodic  update
                        strategy.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
