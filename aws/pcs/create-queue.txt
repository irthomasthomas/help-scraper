       create-queue -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  job queue. You must associate 1 or more compute node groups
       with the queue. You can associate 1 compute node  group  with  multiple
       queues.

OPTIONS
       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The name or ID of the cluster for which to create a queue.

       --queue-name (string)
          A name to identify the queue.

       --compute-node-group-configurations (list)
          The  list of compute node group configurations to associate with the
          queue. Queues assign jobs to associated compute node groups.

          (structure)
              The compute node group configuration for a queue.

              computeNodeGroupId -> (string)
                 The compute node group ID for the compute node group configu-
                 ration.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          computeNodeGroupId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "computeNodeGroupId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. Idempotency ensures that an API  request
          completes only once. With an idempotent request, if the original re-
          quest completes successfully, the subsequent retries with  the  same
          client  token return the result from the original successful request
          and they have no additional effect. If you don't  specify  a  client
          token, the CLI and SDK automatically generate 1 for you.

       --tags (map)
          1 or more tags added to the resource. Each tag consists of a tag key
          and tag value. The tag value is optional and can be an empty string.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                 of the queue.

          computeNodeGroupConfigurations -> (list)
              The list of compute node group  configurations  associated  with
