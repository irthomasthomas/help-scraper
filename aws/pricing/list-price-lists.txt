NAME
       list-price-lists -

DESCRIPTION
          o This  feature is in preview release and is subject to change. Your
            use of Amazon Web Services Price List API is subject to  the  Beta
            Service  Participation  terms  of the `Amazon Web Services Service
            Terms <https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/>`__ (Section 1.10). *

       This returns a list of Price List references that the requester if  au-
       thorized  to  view,  given a ServiceCode , CurrencyCode , and an Effec-
       tiveDate . Use without a RegionCode filter to list  Price  List  refer-
       ences  from  all  available Amazon Web Services Regions. Use with a Re-
       gionCode filter to get the Price List reference that's  specific  to  a
       specific  Amazon Web Services Region. You can use the PriceListArn from
       the response to  get  your  preferred  Price  List  files  through  the
       GetPriceListFileUrl API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-price-lists  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: PriceLists

OPTIONS
       --service-code (string)
          The service code or the Savings Plan service code for the attributes
          that  you want to retrieve. For example, to get the list of applica-
          ble Amazon EC2 price lists, use AmazonEC2 . For a full list of  ser-
          vice  codes containing On-Demand and Reserved Instance (RI) pricing,
          use the DescribeServices API.

          To retrieve the Reserved Instance and  Compute  Savings  Plan  price
          lists, use ComputeSavingsPlans .

          To retrieve Machine Learning Savings Plans price lists, use Machine-
          LearningSavingsPlans .

       --effective-date (timestamp)
          The date that the Price List file prices are effective from.

       --region-code (string)
          This is used to filter the Price List by Amazon Web Services Region.
          For  example,  to  get  the price list only for the US East (N. Vir-
          ginia) Region, use us-east-1 . If nothing is specified, you retrieve
          price  lists  for  all  applicable Regions. The available RegionCode
          list can be retrieved from GetAttributeValues API.

       --currency-code (string)
          The three alphabetical character ISO-4217  currency  code  that  the
          Price List files are denominated in.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       seconds.
