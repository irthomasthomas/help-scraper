GEO-ROUTES()                                                      GEO-ROUTES()



NAME
       geo-routes -

DESCRIPTION
       With  the Amazon Location Routes API you can calculate routes and esti-
       mate travel time based on up-to-date road network and live traffic  in-
       formation.

       Calculate  optimal  travel  routes  and  estimate  travel  times  using
       up-to-date road network and traffic data. Key features include:

       o Point-to-point routing with  estimated  travel  time,  distance,  and
         turn-by-turn directions

       o Multi-point route optimization to minimize travel time or distance

       o Route matrices for efficient multi-destination planning

       o Isoline  calculations  to  determine reachable areas within specified
         time or distance thresholds

       o Map-matching to align GPS traces with the road network
