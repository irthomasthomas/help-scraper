          for the model. Set to true to accept the EULA.

       --endpoint-name (string)
          The  name of the endpoint. This name must be unique within your Ama-
          zon Web Services account and region.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request. This token is listed as not required be-
          cause Amazon Web Services SDKs automatically generate it for you and
          set  this parameter. If you're not using the Amazon Web Services SDK
          or the CLI, you must provide this token or the action will fail.

          (structure)
              Definition of the key/value pair for a tag.

              key -> (string)
                 Key for the tag.

              value -> (string)
                 Value for the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [

            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.
