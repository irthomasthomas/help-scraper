LIST-MODEL-INVOCATION-JOBS()                      LIST-MODEL-INVOCATION-JOBS()



NAME
       list-model-invocation-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  batch  inference jobs in the account. For more information,
       see View details about a batch inference job .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-model-invocation-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: invocationJobSummaries

OPTIONS
       --submit-time-after (timestamp)

          ted after the time you specify.

       --submit-time-before (timestamp)
          Specify a time to filter for batch inference jobs that were  submit-
          ted before the time you specify.

       --status-equals (string)
          Specify  a  status to filter for batch inference jobs whose statuses
          match the string you specify.

          Possible values:

          o Submitted

          o InProgress

          o Completed

          o Failed

          o Stopping

          o Stopped

          o PartiallyCompleted

          o Expired

          o Validating

          o Scheduled

       --name-contains (string)
          Specify a string to filter for batch inference jobs whose names con-
          tain the string.

       --sort-by (string)
          An attribute by which to sort the results.

          Possible values:

          o CreationTime

       --sort-order (string)
          Specifies whether to sort the results by ascending or descending or-
          der.

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          If there are more results than can fit in the response, a  nextToken
          is returned. Use the nextToken in a request to return the next batch
          of results.

       invocationJobSummaries -> (list)
          A list of items, each of which contains a summary about a batch  in-
          ference job.

                 matches a previous request, Amazon Bedrock  ignores  the  re-
                 quest,  but  does  not return an error. For more information,
