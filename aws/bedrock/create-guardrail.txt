CREATE-GUARDRAIL()                                          CREATE-GUARDRAIL()



NAME
       create-guardrail -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a guardrail to block topics and to filter out harmful content.

       o Specify a name and optional description .

       o Specify  messages for when the guardrail successfully blocks a prompt
         or a model response  in  the  blockedInputMessaging  and  blockedOut-
         putsMessaging fields.

       o Specify topics for the guardrail to deny in the topicPolicyConfig ob-
         ject. Each GuardrailTopicConfig object in the topicsConfig list  per-
         tains to one topic.

         o Give  a  name  and  description  so that the guardrail can properly
           identify the topic.

         o Specify DENY in the type field.

         o (Optional) Provide up to five prompts that you would categorize  as
           belonging to the topic in the examples list.

       o Specify filter strengths for the harmful categories defined in Amazon
         Bedrock     in     the     contentPolicyConfig      object.      Each
         GuardrailContentFilterConfig  object  in  the filtersConfig list per-
         tains to a harmful category. For more information, see  Content  fil-
         ters . For more information about the fields in a content filter, see
         GuardrailContentFilterConfig .

         o Specify the category in the type field.

         o Specify the strength of the filter for prompts in the inputStrength
           field  and  for  model  responses  in  the  strength  field  of the
           GuardrailContentFilterConfig .

       o (Optional) For security, include the ARN of a KMS key in the kmsKeyId
         field.

       o (Optional)  Attach  any tags to the guardrail in the tags object. For
         more information, see Tag resources .

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "topicsConfig": [
              {
                "name": "string",
                "definition": "string",
                "examples": ["string", ...],
                "type": "DENY"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --content-policy-config (structure)
          The content filter policies to configure for the guardrail.

          filtersConfig -> (list)
              Contains the type of the content  filter  and  how  strongly  it
              should apply to prompts and model responses.

              (structure)
                 Contains  filter  strengths  for  harmful content. Guardrails
                 support the following content filters to  detect  and  filter
                 harmful user inputs and FM-generated outputs.

                 o Hate  Describes language or a statement that discriminates,
                   criticizes, insults, denounces, or dehumanizes a person  or
                   group on the basis of an identity (such as race, ethnicity,
                   gender, religion, sexual orientation, ability, and national
                   origin).

                 o Insults   Describes  language  or a statement that includes
                   demeaning, humiliating, mocking, insulting,  or  belittling
                   language.  This  type of language is also labeled as bully-
                   ing.

                 o Sexual  Describes language or a  statement  that  indicates
                   sexual interest, activity, or arousal using direct or indi-
                   rect references to body parts, physical traits, or sex.

                 o Violence  Describes language or a statement  that  includes
                   glorification of or threats to inflict physical pain, hurt,
                   or injury toward a person, group or thing.

                 Content filtering depends on the confidence classification of
                 user  inputs and FM responses across each of the four harmful
                 categories. All input and output  statements  are  classified
                 into  one of four confidence levels (NONE, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
                 for each harmful category. For example,  if  a  statement  is
                 classified  as  Hate  with HIGH confidence, the likelihood of
                 the statement representing hateful content is high. A  single
                 statement  can  be classified across multiple categories with
                 varying confidence levels. For example,  a  single  statement
                 can  be classified as Hate with HIGH confidence, Insults with
                 LOW confidence, Sexual with  NONE  confidence,  and  Violence
                 with MEDIUM confidence.

                 This data type is used in the following API operations:

                 o CreateGuardrail request body

                 o UpdateGuardrail request body

                 type -> (string)
                     The  harmful  category that the content filter is applied
                     to.

                 inputStrength -> (string)
                     The strength of the content filter to apply  to  prompts.
                     As  you  increase  the filter strength, the likelihood of
                     filtering harmful content increases and  the  probability
                     of seeing harmful content in your application reduces.

                 outputStrength -> (string)
                     The  strength of the content filter to apply to model re-
                     sponses. As you increase the filter strength, the likeli-
                     hood of filtering harmful content increases and the prob-
                     ability of seeing harmful content in your application re-
                     duces.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not

       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
