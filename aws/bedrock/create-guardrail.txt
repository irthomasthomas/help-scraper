CREATE-GUARDRAIL()                                          CREATE-GUARDRAIL()



NAME
       create-guardrail -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  guardrail  to  block topics and to implement safeguards for
       your generative AI applications.

       You can configure the following policies in a guardrail to avoid  unde-
       sirable  and  harmful  content, filter out denied topics and words, and
       remove sensitive information for privacy protection.

       o Content filters - Adjust filter strengths to block input  prompts  or
         model responses containing harmful content.

       o Denied  topics  -  Define a set of topics that are undesirable in the
         context of your application. These topics will be blocked if detected
         in user queries or model responses.

       o Word filters - Configure filters to block undesirable words, phrases,
         and profanity. Such words can  include  offensive  terms,  competitor
         names etc.

       o Sensitive  information  filters - Block or mask sensitive information
         such as personally identifiable information (PII) or custom regex  in
         user inputs and model responses.

       In  addition to the above policies, you can also configure the messages
       to be returned to the user if a user input or model response is in vio-
       lation of the policies defined in the guardrail.

          {
            "topicsConfig": [
              {
                "name": "string",
                "definition": "string",
                "examples": ["string", ...],

              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --content-policy-config (structure)
          The content filter policies to configure for the guardrail.

          filtersConfig -> (list)
              Contains the type of the content  filter  and  how  strongly  it
              should apply to prompts and model responses.

              (structure)
                 Contains  filter  strengths  for  harmful content. Guardrails
                 support the following content filters to  detect  and  filter
                 harmful user inputs and FM-generated outputs.

                 o Hate  Describes language or a statement that discriminates,
                   criticizes, insults, denounces, or dehumanizes a person  or
                   group on the basis of an identity (such as race, ethnicity,
                   gender, religion, sexual orientation, ability, and national
                   origin).

                 o Insults   Describes  language  or a statement that includes
                   demeaning, humiliating, mocking, insulting,  or  belittling
                   language.  This  type of language is also labeled as bully-
                   ing.

                 o Sexual  Describes language or a  statement  that  indicates
                   sexual interest, activity, or arousal using direct or indi-
                   rect references to body parts, physical traits, or sex.

                 o Violence  Describes language or a statement  that  includes
                   glorification of or threats to inflict physical pain, hurt,
                   or injury toward a person, group or thing.

                 Content filtering depends on the confidence classification of
                 user  inputs and FM responses across each of the four harmful
                 categories. All input and output  statements  are  classified
                 into  one of four confidence levels (NONE, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
                 for each harmful category. For example,  if  a  statement  is
                 classified  as  Hate  with HIGH confidence, the likelihood of
                 the statement representing hateful content is high. A  single
                 statement  can  be classified across multiple categories with
                 varying confidence levels. For example,  a  single  statement
                 can  be classified as Hate with HIGH confidence, Insults with
                 LOW confidence, Sexual with  NONE  confidence,  and  Violence
                 with MEDIUM confidence.

                 For more information, see Guardrails content filters .

                 type -> (string)
                     The  harmful  category that the content filter is applied
                     to.

                 inputStrength -> (string)
                     The strength of the content filter to apply  to  prompts.
                     As  you  increase  the filter strength, the likelihood of
                     filtering harmful content increases and  the  probability
                     of seeing harmful content in your application reduces.

                 outputStrength -> (string)
                     The  strength of the content filter to apply to model re-
                     sponses. As you increase the filter strength, the likeli-
                     hood of filtering harmful content increases and the prob-
                     ability of seeing harmful content in your application re-
                     duces.

                     The  following  PIIs  are used to block or mask sensitive
                     information:

                     o General

                       o ADDRESS   A  physical  address,  such  as  "100  Main
                         Street,  Anytown,  USA" or "Suite #12, Building 123".
                         An  address  can  include  information  such  as  the
                         street,  building,  location,  city,  state, country,
                         county, zip code, precinct, and neighborhood.

                       o AGE   An individual's age, including the quantity and
                         unit  of  time.  For  example, in the phrase "I am 40
                         years old," Guarrails recognizes  "40  years"  as  an
                         age.

                       o NAME    An  individual's  name. This entity type does
                         not include titles, such as Dr., Mr., Mrs., or  Miss.
                         guardrails  doesn't  apply  this entity type to names
                         that are part of organizations or addresses. For  ex-
                         ample,  guardrails recognizes the "John Doe Organiza-
                         tion" as an organization, and it recognizes "Jane Doe
                         Street" as an address.

                       o EMAIL   An email address, such as marymajor@email.com
                         .

                       o PHONE   A phone number. This  entity  type  also  in-

                         such as a login name, screen name, nick name, or han-
                         dle.

                       o PASSWORD    An  alphanumeric string that is used as a
                         password, such as "very20special#pass ".

                       o DRIVER_ID   The number assigned  to  a  driver's  li-
                         cense,  which  is  an official document permitting an
                         individual to operate one or more motorized  vehicles
                         on  a public road. A driver's license number consists
                         of alphanumeric characters.

                       o LICENSE_PLATE   A license plate for a vehicle is  is-
                         sued  by  the  state  or country where the vehicle is
                         registered. The format for passenger vehicles is typ-
                         ically five to eight digits, consisting of upper-case
                         letters and numbers. The format varies  depending  on
                         the location of the issuing state or country.

                       o VEHICLE_IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER   A Vehicle Identifica-
                         tion Number (VIN) uniquely identifies a vehicle.  VIN

                       o REDIT_DEBIT_CARD_CVV    A  three-digit card verifica-
                         tion code (CVV) that is present on VISA,  MasterCard,
                         and Discover credit and debit cards. For American Ex-
                         press credit or debit cards, the CVV is a  four-digit
                         numeric code.

                       o CREDIT_DEBIT_CARD_EXPIRY    The expiration date for a

                         MM/YY . Guardrails recognizes expiration  dates  such
                         as 01/21 , 01/2021 , and Jan 2021 .

                       o CREDIT_DEBIT_CARD_NUMBER   The number for a credit or

                         nizes credit or debit card numbers when only the last
                         four digits are present.

                       o PIN    A  four-digit  personal  identification number
                         (PIN) with which you can access your bank account.

                       o INTERNATIONAL_BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER   An  International
                         Bank  Account  Number  has  specific  formats in each

                       o SWIFT_CODE    A  SWIFT  code  is a standard format of
                         Bank Identifier Code (BIC) used to specify a particu-
                         lar  bank  or branch. Banks use these codes for money
                         transfers such as international wire transfers. SWIFT
                         codes consist of eight or 11 characters. The 11-digit
                         codes refer to specific branches,  while  eight-digit
                         codes  (or  11-digit  codes ending in 'XXX') refer to
