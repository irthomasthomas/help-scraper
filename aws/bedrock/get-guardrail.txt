OPTIONS
       --guardrail-identifier (string)
          The unique identifier of the guardrail for  which  to  get  details.
          This can be an ID or the ARN.

       --guardrail-version (string)
          The  version of the guardrail for which to get details. If you don't
          specify a version, the response returns details for the  DRAFT  ver-
          sion.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

              (structure)
                 Contains filter strengths  for  harmful  content.  Guardrails
                 support  the  following  content filters to detect and filter
                 harmful user inputs and FM-generated outputs.

                 o Hate  Describes language or a statement that discriminates,
                   criticizes,  insults, denounces, or dehumanizes a person or
                   group on the basis of an identity (such as race, ethnicity,
                   gender, religion, sexual orientation, ability, and national
                   origin).

                 o Insults  Describes language or a  statement  that  includes
                   demeaning,  humiliating,  mocking, insulting, or belittling
                   language. This type of language is also labeled  as  bully-
                   ing.

                 o Sexual   Describes  language  or a statement that indicates
                   sexual interest, activity, or arousal using direct or indi-
                   rect references to body parts, physical traits, or sex.

                 o Violence   Describes  language or a statement that includes
                   glorification of or threats to inflict physical pain, hurt,
                   or injury toward a person, group or thing.

                 Content filtering depends on the confidence classification of
                 user inputs and FM responses across each of the four  harmful
                 categories.  All  input  and output statements are classified
                 into one of four confidence levels (NONE, LOW, MEDIUM,  HIGH)
                 for  each  harmful  category.  For example, if a statement is
                 classified as Hate with HIGH confidence,  the  likelihood  of
                 the  statement representing hateful content is high. A single
                 statement can be classified across multiple  categories  with
                 varying  confidence  levels.  For example, a single statement
                 can be classified as Hate with HIGH confidence, Insults  with
                 LOW  confidence,  Sexual  with  NONE confidence, and Violence
                 with MEDIUM confidence.

                 This data type is used in the following API operations:

                 o GetGuardrail response body

                 type -> (string)
                     The harmful category that the content filter  is  applied
                     to.

                 inputStrength -> (string)
                     The  strength  of the content filter to apply to prompts.
                     As you increase the filter strength,  the  likelihood  of
                     filtering  harmful  content increases and the probability
                     of seeing harmful content in your application reduces.

                     The strength of the content filter to apply to model  re-
                     sponses. As you increase the filter strength, the likeli-
                     hood of filtering harmful content increases and the prob-
                     ability of seeing harmful content in your application re-
                     duces.
