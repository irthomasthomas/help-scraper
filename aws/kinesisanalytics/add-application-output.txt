NAME
       add-application-output -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data Ana-
          lytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2  of  the
          API  supports  SQL and Java applications. For more information about
          version 2, see Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation .

       Adds an external destination to your Amazon Kinesis Analytics  applica-
       tion.

       If  you want Amazon Kinesis Analytics to deliver data from an in-appli-
       cation stream within your application to an external destination  (such
       as  an  Amazon  Kinesis  stream,  an  Amazon  Kinesis Firehose delivery
       stream, or an AWS Lambda function), you add the relevant  configuration
       to your application using this operation. You can configure one or more
       outputs for your application. Each output configuration maps an  in-ap-
       plication stream and an external destination.

       You  can use one of the output configurations to deliver data from your
       in-application error stream to an external destination so that you  can
       analyze the errors. For more information, see Understanding Application
       Output (Destination) .

       Any configuration update, including adding  a  streaming  source  using
       this  operation,  results  in a new version of the application. You can
       use the DescribeApplication operation to find the  current  application
       version.

       For  the limits on the number of application inputs and outputs you can
       configure, see Limits .

       This operation requires permissions to perform the kinesisanalytics:Ad-
       dApplicationOutput action.

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          Name of the application to which you want to add the output configu-
          ration.

       --current-application-version-id (long)
          Version of the application to which you want to add the output  con-
          figuration. You can use the DescribeApplication operation to get the
          current application version. If the version  specified  is  not  the
          current version, the ConcurrentModificationException is returned.

       --application-output (structure)
          An  array  of  objects, each describing one output configuration. In
          the output configuration, you specify the name of an  in-application
          stream,  a destination (that is, an Amazon Kinesis stream, an Amazon
          Kinesis Firehose delivery stream, or an AWS  Lambda  function),  and
          record the formation to use when writing to the destination.

          Name -> (string)
              Name of the in-application stream.

          KinesisStreamsOutput -> (structure)
              Identifies an Amazon Kinesis stream as the destination.

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 ARN of the destination Amazon Kinesis stream to write to.

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 ARN  of the IAM role that Amazon Kinesis Analytics can assume
                 to write to the destination stream on your behalf.  You  need
                 to grant the necessary permissions to this role.

          KinesisFirehoseOutput -> (structure)
              Identifies  an  Amazon  Kinesis  Firehose delivery stream as the
              destination.

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 ARN of  the  destination  Amazon  Kinesis  Firehose  delivery
                 stream to write to.

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 ARN  of the IAM role that Amazon Kinesis Analytics can assume
                 to write to the destination stream on your behalf.  You  need
                 to grant the necessary permissions to this role.

          LambdaOutput -> (structure)
              Identifies an AWS Lambda function as the destination.

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the destination Lambda function
                 to write to.

                 NOTE:
                     To specify an earlier version of the Lambda function than
                     the  latest,  include  the Lambda function version in the
                     Lambda function ARN. For more  information  about  Lambda
                     ARNs, see Example ARNs: AWS Lambda

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 ARN  of the IAM role that Amazon Kinesis Analytics can assume
                 to write to the destination function on your behalf. You need
                 to grant the necessary permissions to this role.

          DestinationSchema -> (structure)
              Describes the data format when records are written to the desti-
              nation. For more information, see Configuring Application Output
              .

              RecordFormatType -> (string)
                 Specifies the format of the records on the output stream.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,KinesisStreamsOutput={ResourceARN=string,RoleARN=string},KinesisFirehoseOutput={ResourceARN=string,RoleARN=string},LambdaOutput={ResourceARN=string,RoleARN=string},DestinationSchema={RecordFormatType=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string",
            "KinesisStreamsOutput": {
              "ResourceARN": "string",
              "RoleARN": "string"
            },
            "KinesisFirehoseOutput": {
              "ResourceARN": "string",
              "RoleARN": "string"
            },
            "LambdaOutput": {
              "ResourceARN": "string",
              "RoleARN": "string"
            },
            "DestinationSchema": {
              "RecordFormatType": "JSON"|"CSV"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
