NAME
       keyspaces -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Keyspaces  (for  Apache Cassandra) is a scalable, highly avail-
       able, and managed Apache Cassandra-compatible database service.  Amazon
       Keyspaces  makes it easy to migrate, run, and scale Cassandra workloads
       in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. With just a few clicks on the  Amazon
       Web  Services Management Console or a few lines of code, you can create
       keyspaces and tables in Amazon Keyspaces, without deploying any  infra-
       structure or installing software.

       In  addition  to supporting Cassandra Query Language (CQL) requests via
       open-source Cassandra drivers, Amazon Keyspaces supports  data  defini-
       tion language (DDL) operations to manage keyspaces and tables using the
       Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, as  well  as  infrastructure  as  code
       (IaC) services and tools such as CloudFormation and Terraform. This API
       reference describes the supported DDL operations in detail.

       For the list of all supported CQL APIs, see Supported  Cassandra  APIs,
       operations,  and data types in Amazon Keyspaces in the Amazon Keyspaces
       Developer Guide .

       To learn how Amazon Keyspaces API actions are recorded with CloudTrail,
       see  Amazon Keyspaces information in CloudTrail in the Amazon Keyspaces
       Developer Guide .

       For more information about Amazon Web Services APIs, for example how to
       implement  retry logic or how to sign Amazon Web Services API requests,
