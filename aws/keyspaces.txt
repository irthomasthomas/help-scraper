NAME
       keyspaces -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Keyspaces  (for  Apache Cassandra) is a scalable, highly avail-
       able, and managed Apache Cassandra-compatible database service.  Amazon
       Keyspaces  makes it easy to migrate, run, and scale Cassandra workloads
       in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. With just a few clicks on the  Amazon
       Web  Services Management Console or a few lines of code, you can create
       keyspaces and tables in Amazon Keyspaces, without deploying any  infra-
       structure or installing software.
          <p>In addition to supporting Cassandra Query Language (CQL) requests
          via open-source Cassandra drivers, Amazon  Keyspaces  supports  data
          definition  language (DDL) operations to manage keyspaces and tables
          using the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI. This  API  reference  de-
          scribes  the  supported DDL operations in detail. </p> <note> <p>For
          the    list    of    all    supported    CQL    APIs,     see     <a
