OPTIONS
       --recommendation-id (string)
          The identifier of the recommendation to update.

       --locale (string)
          The language of the modified recommendation.

       --status (string)
          The recommendation status to update.

          o active

          o dismissed

       --recommended-action-updates (list)
          The list of recommended action status to update. You can update mul-
          tiple recommended actions at one time.

          (structure)
              The  recommended  status to update for the specified recommenda-
              tion action ID.

              ActionId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier of the updated recommendation action.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the updated recommendation action.

                 o applied

                 o scheduled

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ActionId=string,Status=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ActionId": "string",
              "Status": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                                          value.  If the number of active ses-
