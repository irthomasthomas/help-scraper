MODIFY-CURRENT-DB-CLUSTER-CAPACITY()      MODIFY-CURRENT-DB-CLUSTER-CAPACITY()



NAME
       modify-current-db-cluster-capacity -

DESCRIPTION
       Set  the  capacity  of an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster to a specific
       value.

       Aurora Serverless v1 scales seamlessly based on the workload on the  DB
       cluster.  In  some  cases,  the capacity might not scale fast enough to
       meet a sudden change in workload, such as a large number of new  trans-
       actions.  Call  ModifyCurrentDBClusterCapacity  to set the capacity ex-
       plicitly.

       After this call sets the DB cluster capacity, Aurora Serverless v1  can
       automatically  scale  the  DB  cluster based on the cooldown period for
       scaling up and the cooldown period for scaling down.

       For more information about Aurora Serverless v1, see Using  Amazon  Au-
       rora Serverless v1 in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

       WARNING:
          If  you  call  ModifyCurrentDBClusterCapacity with the default Time-
          outAction , connections that prevent Aurora Serverless v1 from find-
          ing  a  scaling  point  might be dropped. For more information about
          scaling points, see Autoscaling for Aurora Serverless v1 in the Ama-
          zon Aurora User Guide .

       NOTE:
          This action only applies to Aurora Serverless v1 DB clusters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-current-db-cluster-capacity
          --db-cluster-identifier <value>
          [--capacity <value>]
          [--seconds-before-timeout <value>]
          [--timeout-action <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  DB  cluster identifier for the cluster being modified. This pa-
          rameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing DB cluster.

       --capacity (integer)
          The DB cluster capacity.

          When you change the capacity of a paused  Aurora  Serverless  v1  DB
          cluster, it automatically resumes.

          Constraints:

          o For  Aurora  MySQL, valid capacity values are 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 ,
            32 , 64 , 128 , and 256 .

          o For Aurora PostgreSQL, valid capacity values are 2 , 4 , 8 , 16  ,
            32 , 64 , 192 , and 384 .

       --seconds-before-timeout (integer)
          The  amount  of time, in seconds, that Aurora Serverless v1 tries to
          find a scaling point to perform seamless  scaling  before  enforcing
          the timeout action. The default is 300.

          Specify a value between 10 and 600 seconds.

       --timeout-action (string)
          The action to take when the timeout is reached, either ForceApplyCa-
          pacityChange or RollbackCapacityChange .
              ForceApplyCapacityChange , the default, sets the capacity to the
              specified value as soon as possible.

              RollbackCapacityChange  ignores the capacity change if a scaling
              point isn't found in the timeout period.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To scale the capacity of an Aurora Serverless DB cluster

       The following modify-current-db-cluster-capacity example scales the ca-
       pacity of an Aurora Serverless DB cluster to 8.

          aws rds modify-current-db-cluster-capacity \
              --db-cluster-identifier mydbcluster \
              --capacity 8

       Output:

          {
              "DBClusterIdentifier": "mydbcluster",
              "PendingCapacity": 8,
              "CurrentCapacity": 1,
              "SecondsBeforeTimeout": 300,
              "TimeoutAction": "ForceApplyCapacityChange"
          }

       For  more  information, see Scaling Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster ca-
       pacity manually in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

OUTPUT
       DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
          A user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This identifier is the unique
          key that identifies a DB cluster.

       PendingCapacity -> (integer)
          A  value  that  specifies the capacity that the DB cluster scales to
          next.

       CurrentCapacity -> (integer)
          The current capacity of the DB cluster.

       SecondsBeforeTimeout -> (integer)
          The number of seconds before a call to  ModifyCurrentDBClusterCapac-
          ity times out.

       TimeoutAction -> (string)
          The timeout action of a call to ModifyCurrentDBClusterCapacity , ei-
          ther ForceApplyCapacityChange or RollbackCapacityChange .
