OPTIONS
       --target-group-name (string)
          The name of the target group to modify.

       --db-proxy-name (string)
          The name of the proxy.

       --connection-pool-config (structure)
          The  settings that determine the size and behavior of the connection
          pool for the target group.

          MaxConnectionsPercent -> (integer)
              The maximum size of the connection pool for  each  target  in  a
              target  group.  The  value  is  expressed as a percentage of the
              max_connections setting for the RDS DB  instance  or  Aurora  DB
              cluster used by the target group.

              If  you  specify  MaxIdleConnectionsPercent , then you must also
              include a value for this parameter.

              Default: 10 for RDS for Microsoft SQL Server, and  100  for  all
              other engines

              Constraints:

              o Must be between 1 and 100.

          MaxIdleConnectionsPercent -> (integer)
              A  value  that controls how actively the proxy closes idle data-
              base connections in the connection pool. The value is  expressed
              as  a  percentage  of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB
              instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group.  With  a
              high  value, the proxy leaves a high percentage of idle database
              connections open. A low value causes the  proxy  to  close  more
              idle connections and return them to the database.

              If  you  specify  this  parameter,  then you must also include a
              value for MaxConnectionsPercent .

              Default: The default value is half of the  value  of  MaxConnec-
              tionsPercent . For example, if MaxConnectionsPercent is 80, then
              the default value of MaxIdleConnectionsPercent  is  40.  If  the
              value  of  MaxConnectionsPercent  isn't  specified, then for SQL
              Server, MaxIdleConnectionsPercent is 5 , and for all  other  en-
              gines, the default is 50 .

              Constraints:

              o Must be between 0 and the value of MaxConnectionsPercent .

          ConnectionBorrowTimeout -> (integer)
              The  number  of  seconds for a proxy to wait for a connection to
              become available in the connection pool. This setting  only  ap-
              plies  when  the  proxy has opened its maximum number of connec-
              tions and all connections are busy with client sessions. For  an
              unlimited wait time, specify 0 .

              Default: 120

              Constraints:

              o Must be between 0 and 3600.

          SessionPinningFilters -> (list)
              Each  item in the list represents a class of SQL operations that
              normally cause all later statements in a session using  a  proxy
              to be pinned to the same underlying database connection. Includ-
              ing an item in the list exempts that  class  of  SQL  operations
              from the pinning behavior.

              Default: no session pinning filters

              (string)

          InitQuery -> (string)
              One  or  more  SQL  statements for the proxy to run when opening
              each new database connection. Typically used with SET statements
              to make sure that each connection has identical settings such as
              time zone and character set. For multiple statements, use  semi-
              colons as the separator. You can also include multiple variables
              in a single SET statement, such as SET x=1, y=2 .

              Default: no initialization query

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MaxConnectionsPercent=integer,MaxIdleConnectionsPercent=integer,ConnectionBorrowTimeout=integer,SessionPinningFilters=string,string,InitQuery=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MaxConnectionsPercent": integer,
            "MaxIdleConnectionsPercent": integer,
            "ConnectionBorrowTimeout": integer,
            "SessionPinningFilters": ["string", ...],
            "InitQuery": "string"
          }

       --new-name (string)
          The new name for the modified DBProxyTarget . An identifier must be-
          gin  with  a letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and
          hyphens; it can't end with a hyphen or contain two  consecutive  hy-
          phens.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       DBProxyTargetGroup -> (structure)
          The settings of the modified DBProxyTarget .

          DBProxyName -> (string)
              The identifier for the RDS proxy  associated  with  this  target
              group.

          TargetGroupName -> (string)
              The  identifier  for  the target group. This name must be unique
              for all target groups owned by your Amazon Web Services  account
              in the specified Amazon Web Services Region.

          TargetGroupArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) representing the target group.

          IsDefault -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether  this  target group is the first one used for
              connection requests by the associated proxy. Because each  proxy
              is  currently  associated  with a single target group, currently
              this setting is always true .

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of this target group. A status  of  available
              means  the target group is correctly associated with a database.
              Other values indicate that you must wait for the target group to
              be ready, or take some action to resolve an issue.

          ConnectionPoolConfig -> (structure)
              The settings that determine the size and behavior of the connec-
              tion pool for the target group.

              MaxConnectionsPercent -> (integer)
                 The maximum size of the connection pool for each target in  a
                 target  group.  The value is expressed as a percentage of the
                 max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora  DB
                 cluster used by the target group.

              MaxIdleConnectionsPercent -> (integer)
                 Controls  how actively the proxy closes idle database connec-
                 tions in the connection pool. The value  is  expressed  as  a
                 percentage  of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB in-
                 stance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group. With  a
                 high  value, the proxy leaves a high percentage of idle data-
                 base connections open. A low value causes the proxy to  close
                 more idle connections and return them to the database.

              ConnectionBorrowTimeout -> (integer)
                 The number of seconds for a proxy to wait for a connection to
                 become available in the connection pool.  Only  applies  when
                 the  proxy  has  opened its maximum number of connections and
                 all connections are busy with client sessions.

              SessionPinningFilters -> (list)
                 Each item in the list represents a class  of  SQL  operations
                 that normally cause all later statements in a session using a
                 proxy to be pinned to the same  underlying  database  connec-
                 tion. Including an item in the list exempts that class of SQL
                 operations from the pinning behavior. This  setting  is  only
                 supported  for  MySQL engine family databases. Currently, the
                 only allowed value is EXCLUDE_VARIABLE_SETS .

                 (string)

              InitQuery -> (string)
                 One or more SQL statements for the proxy to run when  opening
                 each  new database connection. Typically used with SET state-
                 ments to make sure that each connection  has  identical  set-
                 tings  such  as  time zone and character set. This setting is
                 empty by default. For multiple statements, use semicolons  as
                 the  separator.  You can also include multiple variables in a
                 single SET statement, such as SET x=1, y=2 .

          CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the target group was first created.

          UpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the target group was last updated.
