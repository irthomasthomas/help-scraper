CREATE-DB-CLUSTER()                                        CREATE-DB-CLUSTER()



NAME
       create-db-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new Amazon Aurora DB cluster or Multi-AZ DB cluster.

       If  you create an Aurora DB cluster, the request creates an empty clus-
       ter. You must explicitly create the writer instance for your DB cluster
       using the CreateDBInstance operation. If you create a Multi-AZ DB clus-
       ter, the request creates a writer and two reader DB instances for  you,
       each in a different Availability Zone.

       You can use the ReplicationSourceIdentifier parameter to create an Ama-
       zon Aurora DB cluster as a read replica of another DB cluster or Amazon
       RDS  for  MySQL  or  PostgreSQL DB instance. For more information about
       Amazon Aurora, see What is Amazon Aurora? in  the  Amazon  Aurora  User
       Guide .

       You  can also use the ReplicationSourceIdentifier parameter to create a
       Multi-AZ DB cluster read replica with an RDS for MySQL or PostgreSQL DB
       instance  as  the  source. For more information about Multi-AZ DB clus-
       ters, see Multi-AZ DB cluster deployments in the Amazon RDS User  Guide
       .

          ]

       --storage-encrypted | --no-storage-encrypted (boolean)
          Specifies whether the DB cluster is encrypted.

          Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB clus-
          ter.

          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN,  key  ID,
          alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a dif-
          ferent Amazon Web Services account, specify the  key  ARN  or  alias
          ARN.

          When a KMS key isn't specified in KmsKeyId :

          o If  ReplicationSourceIdentifier  identifies  an  encrypted source,
            then Amazon RDS uses the KMS key used to encrypt the source.  Oth-
            erwise, Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key.

          o If  the StorageEncrypted parameter is enabled and ReplicationSour-
            ceIdentifier isn't specified, then Amazon RDS  uses  your  default
            KMS key.

          There  is  a  default  KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account.
          Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for
          each Amazon Web Services Region.

          If  you  create a read replica of an encrypted DB cluster in another
          Amazon Web Services Region, make sure to set KmsKeyId to a  KMS  key
          identifier  that is valid in the destination Amazon Web Services Re-
          gion. This KMS key is used to encrypt the read replica in that  Ama-
          zon Web Services Region.

          Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

       --pre-signed-url (string)
          When  you  are replicating a DB cluster from one Amazon Web Services
          GovCloud (US) Region to another, an URL that  contains  a  Signature
          Version  4  signed  request  for the CreateDBCluster operation to be
          called in the source Amazon Web Services Region where the DB cluster
          is  replicated from. Specify PreSignedUrl only when you are perform-
          ing cross-Region replication from an encrypted DB cluster.

          The presigned URL must be a valid request  for  the  CreateDBCluster
          API  operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region
          that contains the encrypted DB cluster to copy.

          The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter  val-
          ues:

          o KmsKeyId  -  The  KMS key identifier for the KMS key to use to en-
            crypt the copy of the DB cluster in  the  destination  Amazon  Web
            Services  Region.  This  should refer to the same KMS key for both
            the CreateDBCluster operation that is called  in  the  destination
            Amazon  Web  Services  Region,  and the operation contained in the
            presigned URL.

          o DestinationRegion - The name of the  Amazon  Web  Services  Region
            that Aurora read replica will be created in.

          o ReplicationSourceIdentifier  -  The  DB cluster identifier for the
            encrypted DB cluster to be copied. This identifier must be in  the
            Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Ser-
            vices Region. For example, if you  are  copying  an  encrypted  DB
            cluster  from  the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your
            ReplicationSourceIdentifier    would    look     like     Example:
            arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:aurora-cluster1 .

          To  learn  how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see
          Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services
          Signature Version 4) and Signature Version 4 Signing Process .

          NOTE:
              If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you
              can specify SourceRegion (or --source-region for  the  CLI)  in-
              stead  of specifying PreSignedUrl manually. Specifying SourceRe-
              gion autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid  request  for
              the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Re-
              gion.

          Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters only

       --enable-iam-database-authentication | --no-enable-iam-database-authen-
       tication (boolean)
          Specifies  whether to enable mapping of Amazon Web Services Identity
          and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database  accounts.  By  de-
          fault, mapping isn't enabled.

          For  more information, see IAM Database Authentication in the Amazon
          Aurora User Guide or IAM database authentication for MariaDB, MySQL,
          and PostgreSQL in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

       --backtrack-window (long)
          The  target  backtrack  window, in seconds. To disable backtracking,

          MinCapacity -> (integer)
              The minimum capacity for an Aurora DB cluster in  serverless  DB
              engine mode.

              For Aurora MySQL, valid capacity values are 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 ,
              32 , 64 , 128 , and 256 .

              For Aurora PostgreSQL, valid capacity values are 2 , 4 , 8 ,  16
              , 32 , 64 , 192 , and 384 .

              The  minimum  capacity must be less than or equal to the maximum
              capacity.

          MaxCapacity -> (integer)
              The maximum capacity for an Aurora DB cluster in  serverless  DB
              engine mode.

              For Aurora MySQL, valid capacity values are 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 ,
              32 , 64 , 128 , and 256 .

              Indicates whether to allow or disallow automatic  pause  for  an
              Aurora DB cluster in serverless DB engine mode. A DB cluster can
              be paused only when it's idle (it has no connections).

              NOTE:
                 If a DB cluster is paused for more than seven  days,  the  DB
                 cluster might be backed up with a snapshot. In this case, the
                 DB cluster is restored when there is a request to connect  to
                 it.

          SecondsUntilAutoPause -> (integer)
              The  time, in seconds, before an Aurora DB cluster in serverless

              The action to take when the timeout is reached, either  ForceAp-
              plyCapacityChange or RollbackCapacityChange .
                 ForceApplyCapacityChange  sets  the capacity to the specified
                 value as soon as possible.

                 RollbackCapacityChange , the default,  ignores  the  capacity
                 change if a scaling point isn't found in the timeout period.

              WARNING:
                 If  you  specify  ForceApplyCapacityChange , connections that
                 prevent Aurora Serverless v1 from  finding  a  scaling  point
                 might be dropped.

              For  more  information, see Autoscaling for Aurora Serverless v1
              in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

          SecondsBeforeTimeout -> (integer)
              The amount of time, in seconds, that Aurora Serverless v1  tries
              to  find  a scaling point to perform seamless scaling before en-
              forcing the timeout action. The default is 300.

              Specify a value between 60 and 600 seconds.

          Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters only

       --enable-http-endpoint | --no-enable-http-endpoint (boolean)
          Specifies whether to enable the HTTP endpoint for the DB cluster. By
          default, the HTTP endpoint isn't enabled.

          When enabled, the HTTP endpoint provides a connectionless  web  ser-
          vice  API  (RDS Data API) for running SQL queries on the DB cluster.
          You can also query your database from inside the  RDS  console  with
          the RDS query editor.

          RDS Data API is supported with the following DB clusters:

          o Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless v2 and provisioned

          o Aurora PostgreSQL and Aurora MySQL Serverless v1

          For  more  information,  see Using RDS Data API in the Amazon Aurora
          User Guide .

          Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters only

       --enable-global-write-forwarding |  --no-enable-global-write-forwarding
       (boolean)
          Specifies  whether to enable this DB cluster to forward write opera-
          tions to the primary cluster of  a  global  cluster  (Aurora  global
          database). By default, write operations are not allowed on Aurora DB
          clusters that are secondary clusters in an Aurora global database.

          You can set this value only on Aurora DB clusters that  are  members
          of  an  Aurora  global database. With this parameter enabled, a sec-
          ondary cluster can forward writes to the  current  primary  cluster,
          and  the  resulting changes are replicated back to this cluster. For
          the primary DB cluster of an Aurora global database, this  value  is
          used  immediately  if the primary is demoted by a global cluster API
          operation, but it does nothing until then.

          Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters only

       --db-cluster-instance-class (string)
          The compute and memory capacity of each DB instance in the  Multi-AZ
          DB cluster, for example db.m6gd.xlarge . Not all DB instance classes
          are available in all Amazon Web Services Regions, or for  all  data-
          base engines.

          For  the  full list of DB instance classes and availability for your
          engine, see DB instance class in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          This setting is required to create a Multi-AZ DB cluster.

          Valid for Cluster Type: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

       --allocated-storage (integer)
          The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB) to allocate to each DB  in-
          stance in the Multi-AZ DB cluster.

          Valid for Cluster Type: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

          This setting is required to create a Multi-AZ DB cluster.

       --storage-type (string)
          The storage type to associate with the DB cluster.

          For information on storage types for Aurora DB clusters, see Storage
          configurations for Amazon Aurora DB clusters .  For  information  on
          storage  types  for  Multi-AZ DB clusters, see Settings for creating
          Multi-AZ DB clusters .

          This setting is required to create a Multi-AZ DB cluster.

          When specified for a Multi-AZ DB cluster, a value for the  Iops  pa-
          rameter is required.

          Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

          Valid Values:

          o Aurora DB clusters - aurora | aurora-iopt1

          o Multi-AZ DB clusters - io1 | io2 | gp3

          Default:

          o Aurora DB clusters - aurora

          o Multi-AZ DB clusters - io1

          NOTE:
              When  you  create an Aurora DB cluster with the storage type set
              to aurora-iopt1 , the storage type is returned in the  response.
              The storage type isn't returned when you set it to aurora .

       --iops (integer)
          The  amount of Provisioned IOPS (input/output operations per second)
          to be initially allocated for each DB instance in  the  Multi-AZ  DB
          cluster.

            DB cluster.

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          Specifies whether the DB cluster is publicly accessible.

          When the DB cluster is publicly accessible and you connect from out-
          side of the DB cluster's virtual private  cloud  (VPC),  its  Domain
          Name  System  (DNS) endpoint resolves to the public IP address. When
          you connect from within the same VPC as the DB cluster, the endpoint
          resolves  to the private IP address. Access to the DB cluster is ul-
          timately controlled by the security group it uses. That  public  ac-
          cess  isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the DB clus-
          ter doesn't permit it.

          When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal  DB
          cluster with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

          Valid for Cluster Type: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

          Default:  The default behavior varies depending on whether DBSubnet-
          GroupName is specified.

          If DBSubnetGroupName isn't specified, and  PubliclyAccessible  isn't
          specified, the following applies:

          o If  the  default  VPC in the target Region doesnt have an internet
            gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.

          o If the default VPC in the target Region has  an  internet  gateway
            attached to it, the DB cluster is public.

          If  DBSubnetGroupName  is  specified,  and  PubliclyAccessible isn't
          specified, the following applies:

          o If the subnets are part of a VPC  that  doesnt  have  an  internet
            gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.

          o If  the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway at-
            tached to it, the DB cluster is public.

       --auto-minor-version-upgrade |  --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade  (bool-
       ean)
          Specifies whether minor engine upgrades are applied automatically to
          the DB cluster during the maintenance window. By default, minor  en-
          gine upgrades are applied automatically.

          Valid for Cluster Type: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

       --monitoring-interval (integer)
          The  interval,  in  seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring
          metrics are collected for the DB cluster. To turn off collecting En-
          hanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0 .

          If  MonitoringRoleArn is specified, also set MonitoringInterval to a
          value other than 0 .

          Valid for Cluster Type: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

          Valid Values: 0 | 1 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 30 | 60

          Default: 0

       --monitoring-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the IAM role that permits RDS  to
          send Enhanced Monitoring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. An exam-
          ple is arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess . For  information  on
          creating  a  monitoring  role,  see Setting up and enabling Enhanced
          Monitoring in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          The  Amazon  Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID,
          alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

          If you don't specify a value for PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId ,  then
          Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for
          your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web  Services  account
          has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

          Valid for Cluster Type: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

       --performance-insights-retention-period (integer)
          The number of days to retain Performance Insights data.

          ferent Amazon Web Services account, specify the  key  ARN  or  alias
          ARN.

          If  you  don't  specify  MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId , then the aws/se-
          cretsmanager KMS key is used to encrypt the secret. If the secret is
          in  a  different Amazon Web Services account, then you can't use the
          aws/secretsmanager KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use a
          customer managed KMS key.

          There  is  a  default  KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account.
          Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for
          each Amazon Web Services Region.

          Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

       --enable-local-write-forwarding   |  --no-enable-local-write-forwarding
       (boolean)
          Specifies whether read replicas can forward write operations to  the
          writer  DB  instance in the DB cluster. By default, write operations
          aren't allowed on reader DB instances.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only

       --ca-certificate-identifier (string)
          The CA certificate identifier to use for  the  DB  cluster's  server
          certificate.

          For more information, see Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a
          DB instance in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          Valid for Cluster Type: Multi-AZ DB clusters

       --engine-lifecycle-support (string)
          The life cycle type for this DB cluster.

          NOTE:
              By default, this value is set  to  open-source-rds-extended-sup-
              port  ,  which  enrolls your DB cluster into Amazon RDS Extended
              Support. At the end of standard support, you can  avoid  charges
              for Extended Support by setting the value to open-source-rds-ex-
              tended-support-disabled . In this case, creating the DB  cluster
              will  fail  if  the DB major version is past its end of standard
              support date.

          You can use this setting to enroll your DB cluster into  Amazon  RDS
          Extended  Support.  With  RDS  Extended Support, you can run the se-
          lected major engine version on your DB cluster past the end of stan-
          dard  support for that engine version. For more information, see the
          following sections:

          Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

          Valid Values: open-source-rds-extended-support | open-source-rds-ex-
          tended-support-disabled

          Default: open-source-rds-extended-support

       --source-region (string)
          The ID of the region that contains the source for the db cluster.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create a MySQL 5.7--compatible DB cluster

       The following create-db-cluster example creates a MySQL  5.7-compatible
       DB  cluster  using the default engine version. Replace the sample pass-
       word secret99 with a secure password. When you use the console to  cre-
       ate  a  DB  cluster, Amazon RDS automatically creates the writer DB in-
       stance for your DB cluster. However, when you use the AWS CLI to create
       a  DB  cluster,  you  must explicitly create the writer DB instance for
       your DB cluster using the create-db-instance AWS CLI command.

          aws rds create-db-cluster \
              --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster \
              --engine aurora-mysql \

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Contains  the  details of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster or Multi-AZ DB
          cluster.

          For an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, this data type is  used  as  a  re-
          sponse element in the operations CreateDBCluster , DeleteDBCluster ,
          DescribeDBClusters ,  FailoverDBCluster  ,  ModifyDBCluster  ,  Pro-
          moteReadReplicaDBCluster  ,  RestoreDBClusterFromS3 , RestoreDBClus-
          terFromSnapshot , RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime ,  StartDBCluster  ,
          and StopDBCluster .

          For a Multi-AZ DB cluster, this data type is used as a response ele-
          ment in the  operations  CreateDBCluster  ,  DeleteDBCluster  ,  De-
          scribeDBClusters  ,  FailoverDBCluster , ModifyDBCluster , RebootDB-
          Cluster ,  RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot  ,  and  RestoreDBClusterTo-
          PointInTime .

          For  more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see What is Ama-
          zon Aurora? in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

          For more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see  Multi-AZ  deploy-
          ments  with two readable standby DB instances in the Amazon RDS User
          Guide.

          AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
              For all database engines except Amazon Aurora,  AllocatedStorage
              specifies the allocated storage size in gibibytes (GiB). For Au-
              rora, AllocatedStorage always returns 1, because Aurora DB clus-
              ter  storage size isn't fixed, but instead automatically adjusts
              as needed.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              The list of Availability Zones (AZs) where instances in  the  DB
              cluster can be created.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              The  number  of  days  for  which automatic DB snapshots are re-
              tained.

          CharacterSetName -> (string)
              If present, specifies the name of the character  set  that  this
              cluster is associated with.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              The  name  of the initial database that was specified for the DB
              cluster when it was created, if one was provided. This same name
              is returned for the life of the DB cluster.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              The user-supplied identifier for the DB cluster. This identifier
              is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              The name of the DB cluster parameter group for the DB cluster.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Information about the subnet group associated with the DB  clus-
              ter,  including the name, description, and subnets in the subnet
              group.

          Status -> (string)
              The current state of this DB cluster.

          AutomaticRestartTime -> (timestamp)
              The time when a stopped DB cluster is restarted automatically.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              The progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The earliest time to which  a  database  can  be  restored  with
              point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              The connection endpoint for the primary instance of the DB clus-
              ter.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint  for
              a  DB cluster load-balances connections across the Aurora Repli-
              cas that are available in a DB cluster. As clients  request  new
              connections  to the reader endpoint, Aurora distributes the con-
              nection requests among the Aurora Replicas in  the  DB  cluster.
              This  functionality  can  help balance your read workload across
              multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster.

              If a failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica that you  are  con-
              nected  to  is promoted to be the primary instance, your connec-
              tion is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other
              Aurora  Replicas  in  the cluster, you can then reconnect to the
              reader endpoint.

          CustomEndpoints -> (list)
              The custom endpoints associated with the DB cluster.

              (string)

          MultiAZ -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the  DB  cluster  has  instances  in  multiple
              Availability Zones.

          Engine -> (string)
              The database engine used for this DB cluster.

          EngineVersion -> (string)
              The version of the database engine.

          LatestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The  latest  time  to  which  a  database  can  be restored with
              point-in-time restore.

          Port -> (integer)
              The port that the database engine is listening on.

          MasterUsername -> (string)
              The master username for the DB cluster.

          DBClusterOptionGroupMemberships -> (list)
              The list of option group memberships for this DB cluster.

              (structure)
                 Contains status information for a DB cluster option group.

                 DBClusterOptionGroupName -> (string)
                     Specifies the name of the DB cluster option group.

                 Status -> (string)
                     Specifies the status of the DB cluster option group.

          PreferredBackupWindow -> (string)
              The daily time range during which automated backups are  created
              if automated backups are enabled, as determined by the BackupRe-
              tentionPeriod .

          PreferredMaintenanceWindow -> (string)
              The weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur,

              Iops -> (integer)
                 The  Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value. This
                 setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

              StorageType -> (string)
                 The storage type for the DB cluster.

              CertificateDetails -> (structure)
                 The details of the DB instances server certificate.

                 For more information, see Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a  connec-
                 tion  to a DB instance in the Amazon RDS User Guide and Using
                 SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB cluster in the Amazon
                 Aurora User Guide .

                 CAIdentifier -> (string)
                     The  CA  identifier of the CA certificate used for the DB
                     instance's server certificate.

                 ValidTill -> (timestamp)
                     The expiration date of the DB instances  server  certifi-
                     cate.

          DBClusterInstanceClass -> (string)
              The  name of the compute and memory capacity class of the DB in-
              stance.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          StorageType -> (string)
              The storage type associated with the DB cluster.

          Iops -> (integer)
              The Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the DB cluster is publicly accessible.

              When the DB cluster is publicly accessible and you connect  from
              outside of the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC), its Do-
              main Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the  public  IP  ad-
              dress. When you connect from within the same VPC as the DB clus-
              ter, the endpoint resolves to the private IP address. Access  to
              the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group it
              uses. That public access isn't permitted if the  security  group
              assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

              When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal
              DB cluster with a DNS name that resolves to  a  private  IP  ad-
              dress.

              For more information, see  CreateDBCluster .

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

              SecretStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the secret.

                 The possible status values include the following:

                 o creating - The secret is being created.

                 o active - The secret is available for normal use  and  rota-
                   tion.

                 o rotating - The secret is being rotated.

                 o impaired  -  The secret can be used to access database cre-
                   dentials, but it can't be rotated. A secret might have this
                   status if, for example, permissions are changed so that RDS
                   can no longer access either the secret or the KMS  key  for
                   the  secret. When a secret has this status, you can correct
                   the condition that caused the status. Alternatively, modify
                   the  DB  instance to turn off automatic management of data-
                   base credentials, and then modify the DB instance again  to
                   turn on automatic management of database credentials.
