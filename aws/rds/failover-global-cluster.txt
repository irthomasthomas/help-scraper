FAILOVER-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()                            FAILOVER-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()



NAME
       failover-global-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Promotes  the specified secondary DB cluster to be the primary DB clus-
       ter in the global database cluster to fail over or switch over a global
       database. Switchover operations were previously called "managed planned
       failovers."

       NOTE:
          Although this operation can be used either to fail over or to switch
          over a global database cluster, its intended use is for global data-
          base failover. To switch over a global database cluster,  we  recom-
          mend that you use the  SwitchoverGlobalCluster operation instead.

       How  you  use this operation depends on whether you are failing over or
       switching over your global database cluster:

       o Failing over - Specify the AllowDataLoss parameter and don't  specify
         the Switchover parameter.

       o Switching  over  -  Specify  the Switchover parameter or omit it, but
         don't specify the AllowDataLoss parameter.
          About failing over and switching over

       While failing over and switching over a global  database  cluster  both
       change  the  primary DB cluster, you use these operations for different
       reasons:

       o Failing over - Use this operation to respond to an  unplanned  event,
         such  as  a Regional disaster in the primary Region. Failing over can
         result in a loss of write transaction data that wasn't replicated  to
         the chosen secondary before the failover event occurred. However, the
         recovery process that promotes a DB instance on the  chosen  seconday
         DB  cluster  to be the primary writer DB instance guarantees that the
         data is in a transactionally consistent state. For  more  information
         about  failing  over an Amazon Aurora global database, see Performing
         managed failovers for Aurora global databases in  the  Amazon  Aurora
         User Guide .

       o Switching  over  -  Use  this  operation on a healthy global database
         cluster for planned events, such as Regional rotation or to fail back
         to  the  original primary DB cluster after a failover operation. With
         this operation, there is no data loss.  For  more  information  about
         switching  over  an  Amazon  Aurora  global  database, see Performing
         switchovers for Aurora global databases in  the  Amazon  Aurora  User
         Guide .

OPTIONS
       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  of the global database cluster (Aurora global data-
          base) this operation should apply to. The identifier is  the  unique
          key assigned by the user when the Aurora global database is created.
          In other words, it's the name of the Aurora global database.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing global database cluster.

       --target-db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the secondary Aurora DB cluster that you  want  to
          promote to the primary for the global database cluster. Use the Ama-
          zon Resource Name (ARN) for the identifier so that Aurora can locate
          the cluster in its Amazon Web Services Region.

       --allow-data-loss | --no-allow-data-loss (boolean)
          Specifies  whether to allow data loss for this global database clus-
          ter operation. Allowing data loss triggers a global failover  opera-
          tion.

          If you don't specify AllowDataLoss , the global database cluster op-
          eration defaults to a switchover.

          Constraints:

          o Can't be specified together with the Switchover parameter.

       --switchover | --no-switchover (boolean)
          Specifies whether to switch over this global database cluster.

          Constraints:

          o Can't be specified together with the AllowDataLoss parameter.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of the global cluster. Possible values are
                 as follows:

                 o pending  The service received a request to switch  over  or
                   fail  over the global cluster. The global cluster's primary
                   DB cluster and the specified secondary DB cluster are being
                   verified before the operation starts.

                 o failing-over   Aurora is promoting the chosen secondary Au-
                   rora DB cluster to become the new  primary  DB  cluster  to
                   fail over the global cluster.

                 o cancelling   The  request  to  switch over or fail over the
                   global cluster was cancelled  and  the  primary  Aurora  DB
                   cluster  and  the  selected secondary Aurora DB cluster are
                   returning to their previous states.

                 o switching-over  This status covers the range of Aurora  in-
                   ternal  operations  that  take  place during the switchover
                   process, such as demoting the primary  Aurora  DB  cluster,
                   promoting  the secondary Aurora DB cluster, and synchroniz-
                   ing replicas.

                 state.

              ToDbClusterArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Aurora DB cluster  that
                 is  currently  being  promoted,  and which is associated with
                 this state.

              IsDataLossAllowed -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the operation is a global switchover  or  a
                 global  failover. If data loss is allowed, then the operation
                 is a global failover. Otherwise, it's a switchover.
