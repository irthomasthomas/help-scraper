DB-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT-AVAILABLE()                DB-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT-AVAILABLE()



NAME
       db-cluster-snapshot-available -

DESCRIPTION
       Wait until JMESPath query DBClusterSnapshots[].Status returns available
       for all elements when polling  with  describe-db-cluster-snapshots.  It
       will  poll  every 30 seconds until a successful state has been reached.
       This will exit with a return code of 255 after 60 failed checks.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       db-cluster-snapshot-available is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: DBClusterSnapshots

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  ID  of  the DB cluster to retrieve the list of DB cluster snap-
          shots for. This parameter can't be used in conjunction with the  DB-
          ClusterSnapshotIdentifier  parameter. This parameter isn't case-sen-
          sitive.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster.

       --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          A specific DB cluster snapshot identifier to describe. This  parame-
          ter can't be used in conjunction with the DBClusterIdentifier param-
          eter. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match the identifier of an  existing  DBCluster-
            Snapshot.

          o If  this identifier is for an automated snapshot, the SnapshotType
            parameter must also be specified.

       --snapshot-type (string)
          The type of DB cluster snapshots to be returned. You can specify one
          of the following values:

          o automated  -  Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been auto-
            matically taken by Amazon RDS for my Amazon Web Services account.

          o manual - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been  taken  by
            my Amazon Web Services account.

          o shared  -  Return  all  manual DB cluster snapshots that have been
            shared to my Amazon Web Services account.

          o public - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been marked  as
            public.

          If  you  don't specify a SnapshotType value, then both automated and
          manual DB cluster snapshots are returned. You can include shared  DB
          cluster  snapshots  with these results by enabling the IncludeShared
          parameter. You can include public DB cluster  snapshots  with  these
          results by enabling the IncludePublic parameter.

          The IncludeShared and IncludePublic parameters don't apply for Snap-
          shotType values of manual or automated . The IncludePublic parameter
          doesn't apply when SnapshotType is set to shared . The IncludeShared
          parameter doesn't apply when SnapshotType is set to public .

       --filters (list)
          A filter that specifies one or more  DB  cluster  snapshots  to  de-
          scribe.

          Supported filters:

          o db-cluster-id - Accepts DB cluster identifiers and DB cluster Ama-
            zon Resource Names (ARNs).

          o db-cluster-snapshot-id - Accepts DB cluster snapshot identifiers.

          o snapshot-type - Accepts types of DB cluster snapshots.

          o engine - Accepts names of database engines.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --include-shared | --no-include-shared (boolean)
          Specifies whether to include shared manual DB cluster snapshots from
          other Amazon Web Services accounts that this Amazon Web Services ac-
          count has been given permission to  copy  or  restore.  By  default,
          these snapshots are not included.

          You  can give an Amazon Web Services account permission to restore a
          manual DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services  account
          by the ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute API action.

       --include-public | --no-include-public (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  to  include manual DB cluster snapshots that are
          public and can be copied or restored by any Amazon Web Services  ac-
          count. By default, the public snapshots are not included.

          You  can  share  a manual DB cluster snapshot as public by using the
          ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute API action.

       --db-cluster-resource-id (string)
          A specific DB cluster resource ID to describe.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
