DB-SNAPSHOT-DELETED()                                    DB-SNAPSHOT-DELETED()



NAME
       db-snapshot-deleted -

DESCRIPTION
       Wait  until  JMESPath  query length(DBSnapshots) == 0 returns True when
       polling with describe-db-snapshots. It will poll every 30 seconds until
       a  successful state has been reached. This will exit with a return code
       of 255 after 60 failed checks.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       db-snapshot-deleted is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: DBSnapshots

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The  ID of the DB instance to retrieve the list of DB snapshots for.
          This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBInstance.

       --db-snapshot-identifier (string)
          A specific DB snapshot identifier to describe. This value is  stored
          as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBSnapshot.

          o If  this identifier is for an automated snapshot, the SnapshotType
            parameter must also be specified.

       --snapshot-type (string)
          The type of snapshots to be returned. You can  specify  one  of  the
          following values:

          o automated  -  Return all DB snapshots that have been automatically
            taken by Amazon RDS for my Amazon Web Services account.

          o manual - Return all DB snapshots that have been taken by my Amazon
            Web Services account.

          o shared  -  Return all manual DB snapshots that have been shared to
            my Amazon Web Services account.

          o public - Return all DB snapshots that have been marked as public.

          o awsbackup - Return the DB snapshots managed by the Amazon Web Ser-
            vices  Backup  service.  For information about Amazon Web Services
            Backup, see the ` Amazon  Web  Services  Backup  Developer  Guide.
            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/whatisbackup.html`__
            The awsbackup type does not apply to Aurora.

          If you don't specify a SnapshotType value, then both  automated  and
          manual  snapshots  are  returned. Shared and public DB snapshots are
          not included in the returned results by  default.  You  can  include
          shared  snapshots  with  these results by enabling the IncludeShared
          parameter. You can include public snapshots with  these  results  by
          enabling the IncludePublic parameter.

          The IncludeShared and IncludePublic parameters don't apply for Snap-
          shotType values of manual or automated . The IncludePublic parameter
          doesn't apply when SnapshotType is set to shared . The IncludeShared
          parameter doesn't apply when SnapshotType is set to public .

       --filters (list)
          A filter that specifies one or more DB snapshots to describe.

          Supported filters:

          o db-instance-id - Accepts DB instance identifiers and  DB  instance
            Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).

          o db-snapshot-id - Accepts DB snapshot identifiers.

          o dbi-resource-id - Accepts identifiers of source DB instances.

          o snapshot-type - Accepts types of DB snapshots.

          o engine - Accepts names of database engines.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              IDs. The filters supported by a  describe  operation  are  docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --include-shared | --no-include-shared (boolean)
          Specifies whether to include shared manual DB cluster snapshots from
          other Amazon Web Services accounts that this Amazon Web Services ac-
          count  has  been  given  permission  to copy or restore. By default,
          these snapshots are not included.

          You can give an Amazon Web Services account permission to restore  a
          manual DB snapshot from another Amazon Web Services account by using
          the ModifyDBSnapshotAttribute API action.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --include-public | --no-include-public (boolean)
          Specifies whether to include manual DB cluster  snapshots  that  are
          public  and can be copied or restored by any Amazon Web Services ac-
          count. By default, the public snapshots are not included.

          You can share a manual DB snapshot as public by using the  ModifyDB-
          SnapshotAttribute API.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --dbi-resource-id (string)
          A specific DB resource ID to describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
