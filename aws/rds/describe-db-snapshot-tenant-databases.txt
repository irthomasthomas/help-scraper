NAME
       describe-db-snapshot-tenant-databases -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  tenant databases that exist in a DB snapshot. This com-
       mand only applies to RDS for Oracle DB instances  in  the  multi-tenant
       configuration.

       You can use this command to inspect the tenant databases within a snap-
       shot before restoring it. You can't directly interact with  the  tenant
       databases  in  a  DB snapshot. If you restore a snapshot that was taken
       from DB instance using the multi-tenant configuration, you restore  all
       its tenant databases.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-db-snapshot-tenant-databases  is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate ar-
       gument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on  a  pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: DBSnapshotTenantDatabases

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The ID of the DB instance used to create the DB snapshots. This  pa-
          rameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBInstance .

       --db-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The  ID  of  a DB snapshot that contains the tenant databases to de-
          scribe. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o If you specify this parameter, the value must match the ID  of  an
            existing DB snapshot.

          o If  you specify an automatic snapshot, you must also specify Snap-
            shotType .

       --snapshot-type (string)
          The type of DB snapshots to be returned. You can specify one of  the
          following values:

          o automated   All DB snapshots that have been automatically taken by
            Amazon RDS for my Amazon Web Services account.

            Backup service.

       --filters (list)
          A filter that specifies one or more tenant databases to describe.

          Supported filters:

          o tenant-db-name  - Tenant database names. The results list only in-
            cludes information about the tenant  databases  that  match  these
            tenant DB names.

          o tenant-database-resource-id  -  Tenant  database  resource identi-
            fiers. The results list only includes information about the tenant
            databases contained within the DB snapshots.

          o dbi-resource-id  -  DB  instance resource identifiers. The results
            list only includes information about snapshots  containing  tenant
            databases  contained  within  the DB instances identified by these
            resource identifiers.

          o db-instance-id - Accepts DB instance identifiers and  DB  instance
            Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).

          o db-snapshot-id - Accepts DB snapshot identifiers.

          o snapshot-type - Accepts types of DB snapshots.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              IDs. The filters supported by a  describe  operation  are  docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribeDBRecommendations

              o DescribeDBShardGroups

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dbi-resource-id (string)
          A specific DB resource identifier to describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)
