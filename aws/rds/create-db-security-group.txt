CREATE-DB-SECURITY-GROUP()                          CREATE-DB-SECURITY-GROUP()



NAME
       create-db-security-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new DB security group. DB security groups control access to a
       DB instance.

       A DB security group controls access to EC2-Classic  DB  instances  that
       are not in a VPC.

       NOTE:
          EC2-Classic  was retired on August 15, 2022. If you haven't migrated
          from EC2-Classic to a VPC, we recommend that you migrate as soon  as
          possible.  For  more  information, see Migrate from EC2-Classic to a
          VPC in the Amazon EC2 User Guide , the blog  EC2-Classic  Networking
          is  Retiring  Heres How to Prepare , and Moving a DB instance not in
          a VPC into a VPC in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --db-security-group-name (string)
          The name for the DB security group. This value is stored as a lower-
          case string.

          Constraints:

          o Must be 1 to 255 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

          o Must not be "Default"

          Example: mysecuritygroup

       --db-security-group-description (string)
          The description for the DB security group.

       --tags (list)
          Tags to assign to the DB security group.

          (structure)
              Metadata  assigned  to  an  Amazon  RDS resource consisting of a
              key-value pair.

              For more information, see Tagging Amazon RDS  resources  in  the
              Amazon  RDS  User  Guide or Tagging Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS
              resources in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 A key is the required name of the tag. The string  value  can
                 be  from  1  to 128 Unicode characters in length and can't be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain only
                 the  set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.',
                 ':',   '/',    '=',    '+',    '-',    '@'    (Java    regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length  and  can't
                 be  prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain
                 only the set of Unicode letters,  digits,  white-space,  '_',
                 '.',   ':',   '/',   '=',   '+',   '-',   '@'   (Java  regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an Amazon RDS DB security group

       The following create-db-security-group command creates a new Amazon RDS
       DB security group:

          aws rds create-db-security-group --db-security-group-name mysecgroup --db-security-group-description "My Test Security Group"

       In the example, the new DB security group is named mysecgroup and has a
       description.

       Output:

          {
              "DBSecurityGroup": {
