NAME
       modify-custom-db-engine-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies the status of a custom engine version (CEV). You can find CEVs
       to modify by calling DescribeDBEngineVersions .

       NOTE:
          The MediaImport service that imports files from Amazon S3 to  create
          CEVs  isn't  integrated  with Amazon Web Services CloudTrail. If you
          turn on data logging for Amazon RDS in CloudTrail, calls to the Mod-
          ifyCustomDbEngineVersion event aren't logged. However, you might see
          calls from the API gateway that  accesses  your  Amazon  S3  bucket.
          These  calls  originate from the MediaImport service for the Modify-
          CustomDbEngineVersion event.

       For more information, see Modifying CEV status in the Amazon  RDS  User
       Guide .

OPTIONS
       --engine (string)
          The  database  engine.  RDS Custom for Oracle supports the following
          values:

          o custom-oracle-ee

          o custom-oracle-ee-cdb

          o custom-oracle-se2

          o custom-oracle-se2-cdb

       --engine-version (string)
          The custom engine version (CEV) that you want to modify. This option
          is  required for RDS Custom for Oracle, but optional for Amazon RDS.
          The combination of Engine and EngineVersion is unique  per  customer
          per Amazon Web Services Region.

       --description (string)
          An optional description of your CEV.

       --status (string)
          The  availability status to be assigned to the CEV. Valid values are
          as follows:
              available

          You can use this CEV to create a new RDS Custom DB instance.
              inactive

          You can create a new RDS Custom instance by restoring a DB  snapshot
          with  this  CEV.  You  can't patch or create new instances with this
          CEV.

          You can change any status to any status. A typical reason to  change
          status  is to prevent the accidental use of a CEV, or to make a dep-
          recated CEV eligible for use again. For example,  you  might  change
          the  status  of your CEV from available to inactive , and from inac-
          tive back to available . To change the availability  status  of  the
          CEV,  it  must  not  currently  be in use by an RDS Custom instance,
          snapshot, or automated backup.

          Possible values:

          o available

          o inactive

          o inactive-except-restore

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
