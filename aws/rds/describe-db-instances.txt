NAME
       describe-db-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes provisioned RDS instances. This API supports pagination.

       NOTE:
          This operation can also return information for Amazon Neptune DB in-
          stances and Amazon DocumentDB instances.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-db-instances is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: DBInstances

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The  user-supplied  instance  identifier or the Amazon Resource Name
          (ARN) of the DB instance. If this parameter is  specified,  informa-
          tion  from only the specific DB instance is returned. This parameter
          isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DB instance.

       --filters (list)
          A filter that specifies one or more DB instances to describe.

          Supported Filters:

          o db-cluster-id - Accepts DB cluster identifiers and DB cluster Ama-
            zon Resource Names (ARNs). The results list only includes informa-
            tion about the DB instances associated with the DB clusters  iden-
            tified by these ARNs.

          o db-instance-id  -  Accepts DB instance identifiers and DB instance
            Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). The results list only  includes  in-
            formation about the DB instances identified by these ARNs.

          o dbi-resource-id  -  Accepts  DB instance resource identifiers. The
            results list only includes  information  about  the  DB  instances
            identified by these DB instance resource identifiers.

          o domain  - Accepts Active Directory directory IDs. The results list
            only includes information about the DB instances  associated  with
            these domains.

          o engine  - Accepts engine names. The results list only includes in-
            formation about the DB instances for these engines.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribeDBRecommendations

              o DescribeDBShardGroups

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 When  the  DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name
                 System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from
                 within  the  DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It re-
                 solves to the public IP address from outside of the DB  clus-
                 ter's  VPC. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled
                 by the security group it uses. That public access isn't  per-
                 mitted  if  the  security  group  assigned  to the DB cluster
                 doesn't permit it.

                 When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an  in-
                 ternal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private
                 IP address.

                 This setting applies only to the gp3 storage type.

              DBSystemId -> (string)
                 The Oracle system ID (Oracle SID) for  a  container  database
                 (CDB).  The Oracle SID is also the name of the CDB. This set-
                 ting is only valid for RDS Custom DB instances.

              MasterUserSecret -> (structure)
                 The secret managed by RDS in Amazon Web Services Secrets Man-
                 ager for the master user password.

                 For more information, see Password management with Amazon Web
                 Services Secrets Manager in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

                 SecretArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret.

                 SecretStatus -> (string)
                     The status of the secret.

                     The possible status values include the following:

                     o creating - The secret is being created.

                     o active - The secret is available for normal use and ro-
                       tation.

                     o rotating - The secret is being rotated.

                     o impaired  -  The  secret can be used to access database
                       credentials, but it can't be rotated.  A  secret  might
                       have  this  status  if,  for  example,  permissions are
                       changed so that RDS can no longer access either the se-
                       cret  or  the KMS key for the secret. When a secret has
                       this status, you can correct the condition that  caused
                       the  status.  Alternatively,  modify the DB instance to
                       turn off automatic management of database  credentials,
                       and  then modify the DB instance again to turn on auto-
                       matic management of database credentials.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier that  is  used
                     to encrypt the secret.

              CertificateDetails -> (structure)
                 The details of the DB instance's server certificate.

                 CAIdentifier -> (string)
                     The  CA  identifier of the CA certificate used for the DB
                     instance's server certificate.

                 ValidTill -> (timestamp)
                     The expiration date of the DB instances  server  certifi-
                     cate.

              ReadReplicaSourceDBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of the source DB cluster if this DB instance
                 is a read replica.

              PercentProgress -> (string)
                 The progress of the storage optimization operation as a  per-
                 centage.

              DedicatedLogVolume -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether the DB instance has a dedicated log volume
                 (DLV) enabled.

              IsStorageConfigUpgradeAvailable -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether an upgrade is recommended for  the  storage
                 file  system  configuration on the DB instance. To migrate to
                 the  preferred  configuration,  you  can  either   create   a
                 blue/green  deployment,  or create a read replica from the DB
                 instance. For more information,  see  Upgrading  the  storage
                 file system for a DB instance .

              MultiTenant -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the DB instance is in the multi-tenant con-
                 figuration (TRUE) or the single-tenant configuration (FALSE).
