DESCRIBE-DB-CLUSTERS()                                  DESCRIBE-DB-CLUSTERS()



NAME
       describe-db-clusters -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  existing Amazon Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters.
       This API supports pagination.

       For more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see What  is  Amazon
       Aurora? in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

       For  more  information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see Multi-AZ DB cluster
       deployments in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

       This operation can also return information for Amazon  Neptune  DB  in-
       stances and Amazon DocumentDB instances.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-db-clusters  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: DBClusters

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The user-supplied DB cluster identifier or the Amazon Resource  Name
          (ARN) of the DB cluster. If this parameter is specified, information
          for only the specific DB cluster is returned. This  parameter  isn't
          case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match an existing DB cluster identifier.

       --filters (list)
          A filter that specifies one or more DB clusters to describe.

          Supported Filters:

          o clone-group-id - Accepts clone group identifiers. The results list
            only includes information about the DB  clusters  associated  with
            these clone groups.

          o db-cluster-id - Accepts DB cluster identifiers and DB cluster Ama-
            zon Resource Names (ARNs). The results list only includes informa-
            tion about the DB clusters identified by these ARNs.

          o db-cluster-resource-id  - Accepts DB cluster resource identifiers.
            The results list will only include information about the DB  clus-
            ters identified by these DB cluster resource identifiers.

          o domain  - Accepts Active Directory directory IDs. The results list
            only includes information about the DB  clusters  associated  with
            these domains.

          o engine  - Accepts engine names. The results list only includes in-
            formation about the DB clusters for these engines.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribeDBRecommendations

              o DescribeDBShardGroups

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --include-shared | --no-include-shared (boolean)
          Specifies whether the output  includes  information  about  clusters
          shared from other Amazon Web Services accounts.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 2: To list certain attributes of all DB clusters

       The  following  describe-db-clusters example retrieves only the DBClus-
       terIdentifier, Endpoint, and ReaderEndpoint attributes of all  your  DB
       clusters in the current AWS Region.

          aws rds describe-db-clusters \
              --query 'DBClusters[].{DBClusterIdentifier:DBClusterIdentifier,Endpoint:Endpoint,ReaderEndpoint:ReaderEndpoint}'

       Output:

          [
              {
                  "Endpoint": "cluster-57-2020-05-01-2270.cluster-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                  "ReaderEndpoint": "cluster-57-2020-05-01-2270.cluster-ro-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                  "DBClusterIdentifier": "cluster-57-2020-05-01-2270"
              },
              {
                  "Endpoint": "cluster-57-2020-05-01-4615.cluster-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",

                  "DBClusterIdentifier": "pg2-cluster"
              },
              ...output omitted...
              }
          ]

       Example 3: To list DB clusters with a specific attribute

       The  following  describe-db-clusters example retrieves only the DBClus-
       terIdentifier and Engine attributes of your DB clusters  that  use  the
       aurora-postgresql DB engine.

          aws rds describe-db-clusters \
              --query 'DBClusters[].{DBClusterIdentifier:DBClusterIdentifier,Engine:Engine} | [?Engine == `aurora-postgresql`]'

       Output:

          [
              {
                  "Engine": "aurora-postgresql",
                  "DBClusterIdentifier": "pg2-cluster"
              }
          ]

              AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
                 For all database engines except Amazon Aurora, AllocatedStor-
                 age  specifies the allocated storage size in gibibytes (GiB).
                 For Aurora, AllocatedStorage always returns 1, because Aurora
                 DB  cluster  storage  size isn't fixed, but instead automati-
                 cally adjusts as needed.

              AvailabilityZones -> (list)
                 The list of Availability Zones (AZs) where instances  in  the

                 The  name  of the initial database that was specified for the
                 DB cluster when it was created, if  one  was  provided.  This
                 same name is returned for the life of the DB cluster.

              DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                 The user-supplied identifier for the DB cluster. This identi-
                 fier is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

              DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
                 The name of the DB cluster parameter group for the  DB  clus-
                 ter.

              ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
                 The reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The  reader  endpoint
                 for  a DB cluster load-balances connections across the Aurora
                 Replicas that are available in a DB cluster. As  clients  re-
                 quest new connections to the reader endpoint, Aurora distrib-
                 utes the connection requests among the Aurora Replicas in the
                 DB  cluster.  This  functionality  can help balance your read
                 workload across multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster.

                 If a failover occurs, and the Aurora  Replica  that  you  are
                 connected  to  is  promoted  to be the primary instance, your
                 connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload
                 to  other Aurora Replicas in the cluster, you can then recon-
                 nect to the reader endpoint.

                 Indicates  whether the DB cluster has deletion protection en-
                 abled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection
                 is enabled.

              HttpEndpointEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether the HTTP endpoint is enabled for an Aurora
                 DB cluster.

                 When enabled, the HTTP endpoint provides a connectionless web
                 service  API (RDS Data API) for running SQL queries on the DB
                 cluster. You can also query your database from inside the RDS
                 console with the RDS query editor.

                 For  more  information,  see Using RDS Data API in the Amazon
                 Aurora User Guide .

              ActivityStreamMode -> (string)
                 The mode of the database  activity  stream.  Database  events
                 such as a change or access generate an activity stream event.

                 within  the  DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It re-
                 solves to the public IP address from outside of the DB  clus-
                 ter's  VPC. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled
                 by the security group it uses. That public access isn't  per-
                 mitted  if  the  security  group  assigned  to the DB cluster
                 doesn't permit it.

                 When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is  an  in-
                 ternal  DB cluster with a DNS name that resolves to a private
                 IP address.

                     o impaired - The secret can be used  to  access  database
                       credentials,  but  it  can't be rotated. A secret might
                       have this  status  if,  for  example,  permissions  are
                       changed so that RDS can no longer access either the se-
                       cret or the KMS key for the secret. When a  secret  has
                       this  status, you can correct the condition that caused
                       the status. Alternatively, modify the  DB  instance  to
