RESTORE-DB-CLUSTER-FROM-SNAPSHOT()          RESTORE-DB-CLUSTER-FROM-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       restore-db-cluster-from-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new DB cluster from a DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot.

       The  target  DB  cluster is created from the source snapshot with a de-
       fault configuration. If you don't specify a security group, the new  DB
       cluster is associated with the default security group.

       NOTE:
          This  action  only restores the DB cluster, not the DB instances for
          that DB cluster. You must invoke the CreateDBInstance action to cre-
          ate DB instances for the restored DB cluster, specifying the identi-
          fier of the restored DB cluster in  DBClusterIdentifier  .  You  can
          create  DB instances only after the RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot ac-
          tion has completed and the DB cluster is available.

       For more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see What  is  Amazon
       Aurora? in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

       For  more  information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see Multi-AZ DB cluster
       deployments in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          following occurs:

          o If the DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot in SnapshotIdentifier is
            encrypted, then the restored DB cluster is encrypted using the KMS
            key that was used to encrypt the DB snapshot or DB  cluster  snap-
            shot.

          o If  the  DB  snapshot or DB cluster snapshot in SnapshotIdentifier
            isn't encrypted, then the restored DB cluster isn't encrypted.

              DB  cluster can be paused only when it's idle (it has no connec-
              tions).

              NOTE:
                 If a DB cluster is paused for more than seven  days,  the  DB
                 cluster might be backed up with a snapshot. In this case, the
                 DB cluster is restored when there is a request to connect  to

              plyCapacityChange or RollbackCapacityChange .
                 ForceApplyCapacityChange  sets  the capacity to the specified
                 value as soon as possible.

                 RollbackCapacityChange , the default,  ignores  the  capacity
                 change if a scaling point isn't found in the timeout period.

              WARNING:
                 If  you  specify  ForceApplyCapacityChange , connections that
                 prevent Aurora Serverless v1 from  finding  a  scaling  point
                 might be dropped.

              For  more  information, see Autoscaling for Aurora Serverless v1
              in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

          SecondsBeforeTimeout -> (integer)
              The amount of time, in seconds, that Aurora Serverless v1  tries
              to  find  a scaling point to perform seamless scaling before en-
              forcing the timeout action. The default is 300.

              Specify a value between 60 and 600 seconds.

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB cluster is  publicly  accessi-
          ble.

          When  the  DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System
          (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB
          cluster's  virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP
          address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB clus-
          ter  is  ultimately  controlled  by the security group it uses. That
          public access is not permitted if the security group assigned to the
          DB cluster doesn't permit it.

          When  the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
          cluster with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

          Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether  DBSubnet-
          GroupName is specified.

          If  DBSubnetGroupName  isn't specified, and PubliclyAccessible isn't
          specified, the following applies:

          o If the default VPC in the target Region doesnt  have  an  internet
            gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.

          o If  the  default  VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway
            attached to it, the DB cluster is public.

          If DBSubnetGroupName  is  specified,  and  PubliclyAccessible  isn't
          specified, the following applies:

          o If  the  subnets  are  part  of a VPC that doesnt have an internet
            gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.

          o If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway  at-
            tached to it, the DB cluster is public.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

       --serverless-v2-scaling-configuration (structure)
          Contains  the  scaling  configuration  of an Aurora Serverless v2 DB
          cluster.

          Amazon Aurora User Guide .

          MinCapacity -> (double)
              The  minimum number of Aurora capacity units (ACUs) for a DB in-
              stance in an Aurora Serverless v2 cluster. You can  specify  ACU
              values  in  half-step  increments, such as 8, 8.5, 9, and so on.
              The smallest value that you can use is 0.5.

          MaxCapacity -> (double)
              The maximum number of Aurora capacity units (ACUs) for a DB  in-
              stance  in  an Aurora Serverless v2 cluster. You can specify ACU
              values in half-step increments, such as 40, 40.5, 41, and so on.
              The largest value that you can use is 128.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MinCapacity=double,MaxCapacity=double

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MinCapacity": double,
            "MaxCapacity": double
          }

       --network-type (string)
          The network type of the DB cluster.

          Valid values:

          o IPV4

          o DUAL

          The  network  type  is determined by the DBSubnetGroup specified for
          the DB cluster. A DBSubnetGroup can support only the  IPv4  protocol
          or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (DUAL ).

          For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in the
          Amazon Aurora User Guide.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Contains  the  details of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster or Multi-AZ DB
          cluster.

          For an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, this data type is  used  as  a  re-
          sponse element in the operations CreateDBCluster , DeleteDBCluster ,
          DescribeDBClusters ,  FailoverDBCluster  ,  ModifyDBCluster  ,  Pro-
          moteReadReplicaDBCluster  ,  RestoreDBClusterFromS3 , RestoreDBClus-
          terFromSnapshot , RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime ,  StartDBCluster  ,
          and StopDBCluster .

          For a Multi-AZ DB cluster, this data type is used as a response ele-
          ment in the  operations  CreateDBCluster  ,  DeleteDBCluster  ,  De-
          scribeDBClusters  ,  FailoverDBCluster , ModifyDBCluster , RebootDB-
          Cluster ,  RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot  ,  and  RestoreDBClusterTo-
          PointInTime .

          For  more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see What is Ama-
          zon Aurora? in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

          For more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see  Multi-AZ  deploy-
          ments  with two readable standby DB instances in the Amazon RDS User
          Guide.

          AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
              For all database engines except Amazon Aurora,  AllocatedStorage
              specifies the allocated storage size in gibibytes (GiB). For Au-
              rora, AllocatedStorage always returns 1, because Aurora DB clus-
              ter  storage size isn't fixed, but instead automatically adjusts
              as needed.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              The list of Availability Zones (AZs) where instances in  the  DB
              cluster can be created.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              The  number  of  days  for  which automatic DB snapshots are re-
              tained.

          CharacterSetName -> (string)
              If present, specifies the name of the character  set  that  this
              cluster is associated with.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              The  name  of the initial database that was specified for the DB
              cluster when it was created, if one was provided. This same name
              is returned for the life of the DB cluster.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              The user-supplied identifier for the DB cluster. This identifier
              is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              The name of the DB cluster parameter group for the DB cluster.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Information about the subnet group associated with the DB  clus-
              ter,  including the name, description, and subnets in the subnet
              group.

          Status -> (string)
              The current state of this DB cluster.

          AutomaticRestartTime -> (timestamp)
              The time when a stopped DB cluster is restarted automatically.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              The progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The earliest time to which  a  database  can  be  restored  with
              point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              The connection endpoint for the primary instance of the DB clus-
              ter.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint  for
              a  DB cluster load-balances connections across the Aurora Repli-
              cas that are available in a DB cluster. As clients  request  new
              connections  to the reader endpoint, Aurora distributes the con-
              nection requests among the Aurora Replicas in  the  DB  cluster.
              This  functionality  can  help balance your read workload across
              multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster.

              If a failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica that you  are  con-
              nected  to  is promoted to be the primary instance, your connec-
              tion is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other
              Aurora  Replicas  in  the cluster, you can then reconnect to the
              reader endpoint.

          CustomEndpoints -> (list)

              The version of the database engine.

          LatestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The  latest  time  to  which  a  database  can  be restored with
              point-in-time restore.

          Port -> (integer)
              The port that the database engine is listening on.

          MasterUsername -> (string)
              The master username for the DB cluster.

              Specifies  whether  write  forwarding is enabled for a secondary
              cluster in an Aurora global database. Because  write  forwarding
              takes  time  to  enable,  check the value of GlobalWriteForward-
              ingStatus to confirm that the request has completed before using
              the write forwarding feature for this cluster.

          PendingModifiedValues -> (structure)

                 The allocated storage size in gibibytes (GiB) for  all  data-
                 base engines except Amazon Aurora. For Aurora, AllocatedStor-
                 age always returns 1, because Aurora DB cluster storage  size
                 isn't fixed, but instead automatically adjusts as needed.

              Iops -> (integer)
                 The  Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value. This

          PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the DB cluster is publicly accessible.

              When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name Sys-
              tem (DNS) endpoint resolves  to  the  private  IP  address  from
              within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves
              to the public IP address from outside of the DB  cluster's  VPC.
              Access  to  the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the secu-
              rity group it uses. That public access isn't  permitted  if  the
              security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

              When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal
              DB cluster with a DNS name that resolves to  a  private  IP  ad-
              dress.

              Valid Values: IPV4 | DUAL

          DBSystemId -> (string)
              Reserved for future use.

          MasterUserSecret -> (structure)
              The secret managed by RDS in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager
              for the master user password.

              For  more  information,  see Password management with Amazon Web
              Services Secrets Manager  in  the  Amazon  RDS  User  Guide  and
              Password  management with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager in
              the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

              SecretArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret.

              SecretStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the secret.

                 The possible status values include the following:

                 o creating - The secret is being created.

                 o active - The secret is available for normal use  and  rota-
                   tion.

                 o rotating - The secret is being rotated.

                 o impaired  -  The secret can be used to access database cre-
                   dentials, but it can't be rotated. A secret might have this
                   status if, for example, permissions are changed so that RDS
                   can no longer access either the secret or the KMS  key  for
                   the  secret. When a secret has this status, you can correct
                   the condition that caused the status. Alternatively, modify
                   the  DB  instance to turn off automatic management of data-
                   base credentials, and then modify the DB instance again  to
                   turn on automatic management of database credentials.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services KMS key identifier that is used to
                 encrypt the secret.

          IOOptimizedNextAllowedModificationTime -> (timestamp)
              The next time you can modify the  DB  cluster  to  use  the  au-
              rora-iopt1 storage type.

              This setting is only for Aurora DB clusters.
