NAME
       backtrack-db-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Backtracks  a  DB cluster to a specific time, without creating a new DB
       cluster.

       For more information on backtracking, see  Backtracking  an  Aurora  DB
       Cluster in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

       NOTE:
          This action applies only to Aurora MySQL DB clusters.

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  DB cluster identifier of the DB cluster to be backtracked. This
          parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Example: my-cluster1

       --backtrack-to (timestamp)
          The timestamp of the time to backtrack the DB cluster to,  specified
          in  ISO  8601  format.  For more information about ISO 8601, see the
          ISO8601 Wikipedia page.

          NOTE:
              If the specified time isn't a consistent time for the  DB  clus-
              ter,  Aurora  automatically chooses the nearest possible consis-
              tent time for the DB cluster.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain a valid ISO 8601 timestamp.

          o Can't contain a timestamp set in the future.

          Example: 2017-07-08T18:00Z

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to force the DB cluster to  backtrack
          when  binary logging is enabled. Otherwise, an error occurs when bi-
          nary logging is enabled.

       --use-earliest-time-on-point-in-time-unavailable   |    --no-use-earli-
       est-time-on-point-in-time-unavailable (boolean)
          A  value  that  indicates whether to backtrack the DB cluster to the
          earliest possible backtrack time when BacktrackTo is set to a  time-
          stamp  earlier than the earliest backtrack time. When this parameter
          is disabled and BacktrackTo is set to a timestamp earlier  than  the
          earliest backtrack time, an error occurs.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To backtrack an Aurora DB cluster

       The  following backtrack-db-cluster example backtracks the specified DB
       cluster sample-cluster to March 19, 2018, at 10 a.m.

          aws rds backtrack-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster --backtrack-to 2018-03-19T10:00:00+00:00

       This command outputs a JSON block that acknowledges the change  to  the
       RDS resource.

OUTPUT
       DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
          Contains  a  user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This identifier is
          the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

       BacktrackIdentifier -> (string)
          Contains the backtrack identifier.

       BacktrackTo -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of the time to which the DB cluster was backtracked.

       BacktrackedFrom -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of the time from which the DB cluster was backtracked.

       BacktrackRequestCreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of the time at which the backtrack was requested.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the backtrack. This property returns one of  the  fol-
          lowing values:

          o applying  -  The backtrack is currently being applied to or rolled
            back from the DB cluster.

          o completed - The backtrack has  successfully  been  applied  to  or
            rolled back from the DB cluster.

          o failed  -  An error occurred while the backtrack was applied to or
            rolled back from the DB cluster.

          o pending - The backtrack is currently  pending  application  to  or
            rollback from the DB cluster.
