DESCRIBE-DB-INSTANCE-AUTOMATED-BACKUPSDESCRIBE-DB-INSTANCE-AUTOMATED-BACKUPS()



NAME
       describe-db-instance-automated-backups -

DESCRIPTION
       Displays  backups  for both current and deleted instances. For example,
       use this operation to find details about automated backups  for  previ-
       ously  deleted  instances.  Current  instances  with  retention periods
       greater than zero (0) are returned for both the DescribeDBInstanceAuto-
       matedBackups and DescribeDBInstances operations.

       All parameters are optional.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-db-instance-automated-backups is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate ar-
       gument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on  a  pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: DBInstanceAutomatedBackups

OPTIONS
       --dbi-resource-id (string)
          The resource ID of the DB instance that is the source of  the  auto-
          mated backup. This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          (Optional)  The user-supplied instance identifier. If this parameter
          is specified, it must match the identifier of  an  existing  DB  in-
          stance. It returns information from the specific DB instance's auto-
          mated backup. This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

       --filters (list)
          A filter that specifies which resources to return based on status.

          Supported filters are the following:

          o status

            o active - Automated backups for current instances.

            o creating - Automated backups that are waiting for the first  au-
              tomated snapshot to be available.

            o retained  -  Automated  backups  for deleted instances and after
              backup replication is stopped.

          o db-instance-id - Accepts DB instance identifiers  and  Amazon  Re-
            source  Names  (ARNs).  The results list includes only information
            about the DB instance automated backups identified by these ARNs.

          o dbi-resource-id - Accepts DB resource identifiers and  Amazon  Re-
            source  Names  (ARNs).  The results list includes only information
            about the DB instance resources identified by these ARNs.

          Returns all resources by default. The status for  each  resource  is
          specified in the response.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              IDs. The filters supported by a  describe  operation  are  docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --db-instance-automated-backups-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replicated automated backups,
          for                                                         example,
          arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:auto-backup:ab-L2IJCEXJP7XQ7HOJ4SIEX-
          AMPLE .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
