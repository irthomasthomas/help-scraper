RESTORE-DB-CLUSTER-FROM-S3()                      RESTORE-DB-CLUSTER-FROM-S3()



NAME
       restore-db-cluster-from-s3 -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an Amazon Aurora DB cluster from MySQL data stored in an Amazon
       S3 bucket. Amazon RDS must be authorized to access the Amazon S3 bucket
       and  the  data  must be created using the Percona XtraBackup utility as
       described in Migrating Data from MySQL by Using an Amazon S3 Bucket  in
       the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

       NOTE:
          This  action  only restores the DB cluster, not the DB instances for
          that DB cluster. You must invoke the CreateDBInstance action to cre-
          ate DB instances for the restored DB cluster, specifying the identi-
          fier of the restored DB cluster in  DBClusterIdentifier  .  You  can
          create DB instances only after the RestoreDBClusterFromS3 action has
          completed and the DB cluster is available.

       For more information on Amazon Aurora, see What is  Amazon  Aurora?  in
       the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

       NOTE:
          This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters. The source DB engine
          must be MySQL.

          vices Secrets Manager in the Amazon RDS User Guide and Password man-
          agement  with  Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager in the Amazon Au-
          rora User Guide.

          Constraints:

          o Can't manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Se-
            crets Manager if MasterUserPassword is specified.

          The  Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to encrypt a secret that
          is automatically generated and managed in Amazon  Web  Services  Se-
          crets Manager.

          This setting is valid only if the master user password is managed by
          RDS in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the DB cluster.

          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN,  key  ID,
          alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a dif-
          ferent Amazon Web Services account, specify the  key  ARN  or  alias
          ARN.

          If  you  don't  specify  MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId , then the aws/se-
          cretsmanager KMS key is used to encrypt the secret. If the secret is
          in  a  different Amazon Web Services account, then you can't use the
          aws/secretsmanager KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use a
          customer managed KMS key.

          There  is  a  default  KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account.
          Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for
          each Amazon Web Services Region.

       --storage-type (string)

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Contains the details of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster or  Multi-AZ  DB
          cluster.

          For  an  Amazon  Aurora  DB cluster, this data type is used as a re-
          sponse element in the operations CreateDBCluster , DeleteDBCluster ,
          DescribeDBClusters  ,  FailoverDBCluster  ,  ModifyDBCluster  , Pro-
          moteReadReplicaDBCluster , RestoreDBClusterFromS3  ,  RestoreDBClus-
          terFromSnapshot  ,  RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime , StartDBCluster ,
          and StopDBCluster .

          For a Multi-AZ DB cluster, this data type is used as a response ele-
          ment  in  the  operations  CreateDBCluster  ,  DeleteDBCluster , De-
          scribeDBClusters , FailoverDBCluster , ModifyDBCluster  ,  RebootDB-
          Cluster  ,  RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot  ,  and RestoreDBClusterTo-
          PointInTime .

          For more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see What is  Ama-
          zon Aurora? in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

          For  more  information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see Multi-AZ deploy-
          ments with two readable standby DB instances in the Amazon RDS  User
          Guide.

          AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
              For  all database engines except Amazon Aurora, AllocatedStorage
              specifies the allocated storage size in gibibytes (GiB). For Au-
              rora, AllocatedStorage always returns 1, because Aurora DB clus-
              ter storage size isn't fixed, but instead automatically  adjusts
              as needed.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              The  list  of Availability Zones (AZs) where instances in the DB
              cluster can be created.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              The number of days for which  automatic  DB  snapshots  are  re-
              tained.

          CharacterSetName -> (string)
              If  present,  specifies  the name of the character set that this
              cluster is associated with.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              The name of the initial database that was specified for  the  DB
              cluster when it was created, if one was provided. This same name
              is returned for the life of the DB cluster.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              The user-supplied identifier for the DB cluster. This identifier
              is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              The name of the DB cluster parameter group for the DB cluster.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Information  about the subnet group associated with the DB clus-
              ter, including the name, description, and subnets in the  subnet
              group.

          Status -> (string)
              The current state of this DB cluster.

          AutomaticRestartTime -> (timestamp)
              The time when a stopped DB cluster is restarted automatically.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              The progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The  earliest  time  to  which  a  database can be restored with
              point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              The connection endpoint for the primary instance of the DB clus-
              ter.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The  reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint for
              a DB cluster load-balances connections across the Aurora  Repli-
              cas  that  are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new
              connections to the reader endpoint, Aurora distributes the  con-
              nection  requests  among  the Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster.
              This functionality can help balance your  read  workload  across
              multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster.

              If  a  failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica that you are con-
              nected to is promoted to be the primary instance,  your  connec-
              tion is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other
              Aurora Replicas in the cluster, you can then  reconnect  to  the
              reader endpoint.

                 DBClusterParameterGroupStatus -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  status  of the DB cluster parameter group
                     for this member of the DB cluster.

                 PromotionTier -> (integer)
                     A value that specifies  the  order  in  which  an  Aurora
                     Replica is promoted to the primary instance after a fail-
                     ure of the existing primary instance. For  more  informa-

                 DB engine mode.

              AutoPause -> (boolean)
                 A value that indicates whether automatic pause is allowed for
                 the Aurora DB cluster in serverless DB engine mode.

                 When the value is set to false for an Aurora Serverless v1 DB
                 cluster, the DB cluster automatically resumes.

              SecondsUntilAutoPause -> (integer)
                 The  remaining  amount of time, in seconds, before the Aurora
                 DB cluster in serverless mode is paused. A DB cluster can  be
                 paused only when it's idle (it has no connections).

              TimeoutAction -> (string)
                 The action that occurs when Aurora times out while attempting
                 to change the capacity of an Aurora  Serverless  v1  cluster.
                 The  value  is either ForceApplyCapacityChange or RollbackCa-
                 pacityChange .
                     ForceApplyCapacityChange , the default, sets the capacity
                     to the specified value as soon as possible.

                     RollbackCapacityChange  ignores  the capacity change if a
                     scaling point isn't found in the timeout period.

              SecondsBeforeTimeout -> (integer)
                 The number of seconds before scaling times out. What  happens
                 when  an  attempted scaling action times out is determined by
                 the TimeoutAction setting.

          DeletionProtection -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the DB cluster  has  deletion  protection  en-
              abled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection is
              enabled.

                     can't be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only
                     contain  only  the  set  of  Unicode   letters,   digits,
                     white-space, '_', '.', ':', '/', '=', '+', '-', '@' (Java
                     regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

                 Value -> (string)
                     A value is the optional value  of  the  tag.  The  string
                     value  can  be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length

              Specifies whether write forwarding is enabled  for  a  secondary
              cluster  in  an Aurora global database. Because write forwarding
              takes time to enable, check  the  value  of  GlobalWriteForward-
              ingStatus to confirm that the request has completed before using
              the write forwarding feature for this cluster.

          PendingModifiedValues -> (structure)
              Information about pending changes to the DB cluster. This infor-
              mation is returned only when there are pending changes. Specific

              IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled -> (boolean)
                 A value that indicates whether mapping of Amazon Web Services
                 Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database ac-
                 counts is enabled.

              EngineVersion -> (string)

                 The  allocated  storage size in gibibytes (GiB) for all data-
                 base engines except Amazon Aurora. For Aurora, AllocatedStor-
                 age  always returns 1, because Aurora DB cluster storage size
                 isn't fixed, but instead automatically adjusts as needed.

              Iops -> (integer)
                 The Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value.  This
                 setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

              StorageType -> (string)
                 The storage type for the DB cluster.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the DB cluster is publicly accessible.

              When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name Sys-
              tem  (DNS)  endpoint  resolves  to  the  private IP address from
              within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves
              to  the  public IP address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC.
              Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by  the  secu-
              rity  group  it  uses. That public access isn't permitted if the
              security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

              When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal
              DB  cluster  with  a  DNS name that resolves to a private IP ad-
              dress.

              For more information, see  CreateDBCluster .

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

                 on. The smallest value that you can use is 0.5.

              MaxCapacity -> (double)
                 The  maximum  number of Aurora capacity units (ACUs) for a DB
                 instance in an Aurora Serverless v2 cluster. You can  specify
                 ACU values in half-step increments, such as 40, 40.5, 41, and
                 so on. The largest value that you can use is 128.

          NetworkType -> (string)
              The network type of the DB instance.

              The network type is determined by  the  DBSubnetGroup  specified

              Services  Secrets  Manager  in  the  Amazon  RDS  User Guide and
              Password management with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager  in
              the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

              SecretArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret.

              SecretStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the secret.

                 The possible status values include the following:

                 o creating - The secret is being created.

                 o active  -  The secret is available for normal use and rota-
                   tion.

                 o rotating - The secret is being rotated.

                 o impaired - The secret can be used to access  database  cre-
                   dentials, but it can't be rotated. A secret might have this
                   status if, for example, permissions are changed so that RDS
                   can  no  longer access either the secret or the KMS key for
                   the secret. When a secret has this status, you can  correct
                   the condition that caused the status. Alternatively, modify
                   the DB instance to turn off automatic management  of  data-
                   base  credentials, and then modify the DB instance again to
                   turn on automatic management of database credentials.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier that  is  used  to
                 encrypt the secret.

              The  next  time  you  can  modify  the DB cluster to use the au-
              rora-iopt1 storage type.

              This setting is only for Aurora DB clusters.

          LocalWriteForwardingStatus -> (string)
              Specifies whether an Aurora DB cluster has in-cluster write for-
              warding enabled, not enabled, requested, or is in the process of
