OPTIONS
       --engine (string)
          The  database  engine.  RDS Custom for Oracle supports the following
          values:

          o custom-oracle-ee

          o custom-oracle-ee-cdb

          o custom-oracle-se2

          o custom-oracle-se2-cdb

       --engine-version (string)
          The name of your CEV. The name format  is  19.*customized_string*  .
          For  example,  a  valid CEV name is 19.my_cev1 . This setting is re-
          quired for RDS Custom for Oracle, but optional for Amazon  RDS.  The
          combination  of  Engine and EngineVersion is unique per customer per
          Region.

       --database-installation-files-s3-bucket-name (string)
          The name of an Amazon S3 bucket that contains database  installation
          files  for  your  CEV.  For  example, a valid bucket name is my-cus-
          tom-installation-files .

       --database-installation-files-s3-prefix (string)
          The Amazon S3 directory  that  contains  the  database  installation
          files   for   your   CEV.  For  example,  a  valid  bucket  name  is
          123456789012/cev1 . If this setting isn't specified,  no  prefix  is
          assumed.

       --image-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  Amazon Machine Image (AMI). For RDS Custom for SQL
          Server, an AMI ID is required to create a CEV. For  RDS  Custom  for
          Oracle,  the  default  is the most recent AMI available, but you can
          specify an AMI ID that was used in a different Oracle CEV. Find  the
          AMIs used by your CEVs by calling the DescribeDBEngineVersions oper-
          ation.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted  CEV.  A
          symmetric  encryption  KMS  key  is required for RDS Custom, but op-
          tional for Amazon RDS.

          If you have an existing symmetric encryption KMS  key  in  your  ac-
          count,  you  can use it with RDS Custom. No further action is neces-
          sary. If you don't already have a symmetric encryption  KMS  key  in
          your  account,  follow  the instructions in Creating a symmetric en-
          cryption KMS key in the Amazon Web Services Key  Management  Service
          Developer Guide .

          You  can  choose the same symmetric encryption key when you create a
          CEV and a DB instance, or choose different keys.

       --description (string)
          An optional description of your CEV.

       --manifest (string)
          The CEV manifest, which is a JSON document that  describes  the  in-
          stallation  .zip  files  stored in Amazon S3. Specify the name/value
          pairs in a file or a quoted string. RDS Custom applies  the  patches
          in the order in which they are listed.

          The following JSON fields are valid:
              MediaImportTemplateVersion

          Version of the CEV manifest. The date is in the format YYYY-MM-DD .
              databaseInstallationFileNames

          Ordered list of installation files for the CEV.
              opatchFileNames

          Ordered list of OPatch installers used for the Oracle DB engine.
              psuRuPatchFileNames

          The PSU and RU patches for this CEV.
              OtherPatchFileNames

          The  patches  that are not in the list of PSU and RU patches. Amazon
          RDS applies these patches after applying the PSU and RU patches.

          For more information, see Creating the CEV manifest  in  the  Amazon
          RDS User Guide .

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags.

                 can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length  and  can't
                 be  prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain
                 only the set of Unicode letters,  digits,  white-space,  '_',
                 '.',   ':',   '/',   '=',   '+',   '-',   '@'   (Java  regex:

       (boolean)
          Specifies  whether to use the latest service-provided Amazon Machine
          Image (AMI) for the CEV. If you specify UseAwsProvidedLatestImage  ,
          you can't also specify ImageId .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
