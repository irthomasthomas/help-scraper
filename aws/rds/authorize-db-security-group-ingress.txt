AUTHORIZE-DB-SECURITY-GROUP-INGRESS()    AUTHORIZE-DB-SECURITY-GROUP-INGRESS()



NAME
       authorize-db-security-group-ingress -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables  ingress  to a DBSecurityGroup using one of two forms of autho-
       rization. First, EC2 or VPC security groups can be added to the DBSecu-
       rityGroup  if  the  application using the database is running on EC2 or
       VPC instances. Second, IP ranges are available if the  application  ac-
       cessing  your  database is running on the internet. Required parameters
       for this API are one of CIDR  range,  EC2SecurityGroupId  for  VPC,  or
       (EC2SecurityGroupOwnerId  and either EC2SecurityGroupName or EC2Securi-
       tyGroupId for non-VPC).

       You can't authorize ingress from an EC2 security group  in  one  Amazon
       Web  Services Region to an Amazon RDS DB instance in another. You can't
       authorize ingress from a VPC security group in one VPC to an Amazon RDS
       DB instance in another.

       For an overview of CIDR ranges, go to the Wikipedia Tutorial .

       NOTE:
          EC2-Classic  was retired on August 15, 2022. If you haven't migrated
          from EC2-Classic to a VPC, we recommend that you migrate as soon  as
          possible.  For  more  information, see Migrate from EC2-Classic to a
          VPC in the Amazon EC2 User Guide , the blog  EC2-Classic  Networking
          is  Retiring  Heres How to Prepare , and Moving a DB instance not in
          a VPC into a VPC in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --db-security-group-name (string)
          The name of the DB security group to add authorization to.

       --cidrip (string)
          The IP range to authorize.

       --ec2-security-group-name (string)
          Name of the EC2 security group to authorize.  For  VPC  DB  security
          groups, EC2SecurityGroupId must be provided. Otherwise, EC2Security-
          GroupOwnerId and either EC2SecurityGroupName  or  EC2SecurityGroupId
          must be provided.

       --ec2-security-group-id (string)
          Id  of  the  EC2  security  group  to authorize. For VPC DB security
          groups, EC2SecurityGroupId must be provided. Otherwise, EC2Security-
          GroupOwnerId  and  either EC2SecurityGroupName or EC2SecurityGroupId
          must be provided.

       --ec2-security-group-owner-id (string)
          Amazon Web Services account number of the owner of the EC2  security
          group  specified  in  the EC2SecurityGroupName parameter. The Amazon
          Web Services access key ID isn't an acceptable value. For VPC DB se-
          curity  groups,  EC2SecurityGroupId  must  be  provided.  Otherwise,
          EC2SecurityGroupOwnerId and either EC2SecurityGroupName or  EC2Secu-
          rityGroupId must be provided.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To associate an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with a DB
       instance

       The following  authorize-db-security-group-ingress  example  configures
       the  default  security group with an ingress rule for the CIDR IP range
       192.0.2.0/24.

          aws rds authorize-db-security-group-ingress \
              --db-security-group-name default \
              --cidrip 192.0.2.0/24

       Output:

          {
              "DBSecurityGroup": {
                  "OwnerId": "123456789012",
                  "DBSecurityGroupName": "default",
                  "DBSecurityGroupDescription": "default",
                  "EC2SecurityGroups": [],
