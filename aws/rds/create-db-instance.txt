CREATE-DB-INSTANCE()                                      CREATE-DB-INSTANCE()



NAME
       create-db-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new DB instance.

       The  new  DB  instance can be an RDS DB instance, or it can be a DB in-
       stance in an Aurora DB cluster. For an Aurora DB cluster, you can  call
       this  operation  multiple times to add more than one DB instance to the
       cluster.

       For more information about creating an RDS DB instance, see Creating an
       Amazon RDS DB instance in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

       For more information about creating a DB instance in an Aurora DB clus-
       ter, see Creating an Amazon Aurora DB cluster in the Amazon Aurora User
       Guide .

          The name of the database to create when the primary DB  instance  of
          the  Aurora  MySQL  DB  cluster  is created. If this parameter isn't
          specified for an Aurora MySQL DB cluster, no database is created  in
          the DB cluster.

          Constraints:

       --availability-zone (string)
          The  Availability  Zone (AZ) where the database will be created. For
          information on Amazon Web Services Regions and  Availability  Zones,
          see Regions and Availability Zones .

          For  Amazon Aurora, each Aurora DB cluster hosts copies of its stor-
          age in three separate  Availability  Zones.  Specify  one  of  these
          Availability  Zones.  Aurora  automatically  chooses  an appropriate
          Availability Zone if you don't specify one.

          Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone in the endpoint's
          Amazon Web Services Region.

          Constraints:

          o The  AvailabilityZone  parameter  can't be specified if the DB in-
            stance is a Multi-AZ deployment.

          o The specified Availability Zone must be in  the  same  Amazon  Web

       ean)
          Specifies whether minor engine upgrades are applied automatically to
          the DB instance during the maintenance window. By default, minor en-
          gine upgrades are applied automatically.

          If  you create an RDS Custom DB instance, you must set AutoMinorVer-
          sionUpgrade to false .

       --license-model (string)
          The license model information for this DB instance.

          NOTE:
              License models for RDS for Db2 require additional configuration.
              The Bring Your Own License (BYOL) model requires a custom param-
              eter group and an Amazon Web Services License Manager  self-man-
              aged  license.  The Db2 license through Amazon Web Services Mar-
              ketplace model requires an Amazon Web Services Marketplace  sub-
              scription.  For more information, see Amazon RDS for Db2 licens-
              ing options in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

              The default for RDS for Db2 is bring-your-own-license .

          This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora or  RDS  Custom  DB  in-
          stances.

          Valid Values:

          o RDS for Db2 - bring-your-own-license | marketplace-license

          o RDS for MariaDB - general-public-license

       --iops (integer)
          The  amount of Provisioned IOPS (input/output operations per second)
          to initially allocate for the DB  instance.  For  information  about
          valid  IOPS values, see Amazon RDS DB instance storage in the Amazon
          RDS User Guide .

          This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. Storage is
          managed by the DB cluster.

          Constraints:

          o For  RDS for Db2, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL - Must be
            a multiple between .5 and 50 of the storage amount for the DB  in-
            stance.

          Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced  Secu-
          rity  TDE,  can't be removed from an option group. Also, that option
          group can't be removed from a DB instance  after  it  is  associated
          with a DB instance.

          This  setting  doesn't  apply  to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB in-
          stances.

       --character-set-name (string)
          For supported engines, the character set (CharacterSet  )  to  asso-
          ciate the DB instance with.

          This setting doesn't apply to the following DB instances:

          o Amazon  Aurora  -  The character set is managed by the DB cluster.
            For more information, see CreateDBCluster .

          o RDS Custom - However, if you need to change the character set, you
            can change it on the database itself.

       --nchar-character-set-name (string)
          The name of the NCHAR character set for the Oracle DB instance.

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

          When  the  DB  instance  is publicly accessible and you connect from
          outside of the DB instance's virtual private cloud (VPC), its Domain
          Name  System  (DNS) endpoint resolves to the public IP address. When
          you connect from within the same VPC as the DB  instance,  the  end-
          point  resolves to the private IP address. Access to the DB instance
          is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That  public
          access is not permitted if the security group assigned to the DB in-
          stance doesn't permit it.

          When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
          instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

          Default:  The default behavior varies depending on whether DBSubnet-
          GroupName is specified.

          If DBSubnetGroupName isn't specified, and  PubliclyAccessible  isn't
          specified, the following applies:

          o If  the  default  VPC in the target Region doesnt have an internet
            gateway attached to it, the DB instance is private.

          o If the default VPC in the target Region has  an  internet  gateway
            attached to it, the DB instance is public.

          If  DBSubnetGroupName  is  specified,  and  PubliclyAccessible isn't
          specified, the following applies:

          o If the subnets are part of a VPC  that  doesnt  have  an  internet
            gateway attached to it, the DB instance is private.

          o If  the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway at-
            tached to it, the DB instance is public.

       --tags (list)
          Tags to assign to the DB instance.

          (structure)
              Metadata assigned to an Amazon  RDS  resource  consisting  of  a
              key-value pair.

              For  more  information,  see Tagging Amazon RDS resources in the
              Amazon RDS User Guide or Tagging Amazon Aurora  and  Amazon  RDS
              resources in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 A  key  is the required name of the tag. The string value can
                 be from 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length  and  can't  be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain only
                 the set of Unicode letters, digits,  white-space,  '_',  '.',
                 ':',    '/',    '=',    '+',    '-',    '@'    (Java   regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A value is the optional value of the tag.  The  string  value
                 can  be  from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length and can't
                 be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can  only  contain
                 only  the  set  of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_',
                 '.',  ':',   '/',   '=',   '+',   '-',   '@'   (Java   regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  of the DB cluster that this DB instance will belong
          to.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

       --storage-type (string)
          The storage type to associate with the DB instance.

          If you specify io1 , io2 , or gp3 , you must also  include  a  value
          for the Iops parameter.

          This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. Storage is
          managed by the DB cluster.

          Valid Values: gp2 | gp3 | io1 | io2 | standard

          Default: io1 , if the Iops parameter is specified. Otherwise, gp2 .

       --tde-credential-arn (string)
          The ARN from the key store with which to associate the instance  for
          TDE encryption.

          This  setting  doesn't  apply  to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB in-
          stances.

       --tde-credential-password (string)
          The password for the given ARN from the key store in order to access
          the device.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

       --storage-encrypted | --no-storage-encrypted (boolean)
          Specifes  whether the DB instance is encrypted. By default, it isn't
          encrypted.

          For RDS Custom DB instances, either enable this setting or leave  it
          unset. Otherwise, Amazon RDS reports an error.

          This  setting  doesn't  apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. The en-
          cryption for DB instances is managed by the DB cluster.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted  DB  in-
          stance.

          The  Amazon  Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID,
          alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a dif-
          ferent  Amazon  Web  Services  account, specify the key ARN or alias
          ARN.

          This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. The Amazon
          Web  Services  KMS  key identifier is managed by the DB cluster. For
          more information, see CreateDBCluster .

          If StorageEncrypted is enabled, and you do not specify a  value  for
          the  KmsKeyId  parameter, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key.
          There is a default KMS key for your  Amazon  Web  Services  account.
          Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for
          each Amazon Web Services Region.

          For Amazon RDS Custom, a KMS key is required for DB  instances.  For
          most  RDS  engines, if you leave this parameter empty while enabling
          StorageEncrypted , the engine uses the default KMS key. However, RDS
          Custom doesn't use the default key when this parameter is empty. You
          must explicitly specify a key.

       --domain (string)
          The Active Directory directory ID to create the DB instance in. Cur-
          rently,  you  can create only Db2, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Ora-
          cle, and PostgreSQL DB instances in an Active Directory Domain.

          For more information, see Kerberos Authentication in the Amazon  RDS
          User Guide .

          If  you don't specify a value for PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId , then
          Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for
          your  Amazon  Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account
          has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

       --performance-insights-retention-period (integer)
          The number of days to retain Performance Insights data.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

          Valid Values:

          o 7

          o month * 31, where month is a number of months from 1-23. Examples:
            93 (3 months * 31), 341 (11 months * 31), 589 (19 months * 31)

          o 731

          Default: 7 days

          If  you  specify  a  retention period that isn't valid, such as 94 ,
          Amazon RDS returns an error.

       --enable-cloudwatch-logs-exports (list)
          The list of log types to enable for exporting  to  CloudWatch  Logs.
          For  more information, see Publishing Database Logs to Amazon Cloud-
          Watch Logs in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          This setting doesn't apply to the following DB instances:

          o Amazon Aurora (CloudWatch Logs exports are managed by the DB clus-
            ter.)

          o RDS Custom

          The following values are valid for each DB engine:

          o RDS for Db2 - diag.log | notify.log

          o RDS for MariaDB - audit | error | general | slowquery

          o RDS for Microsoft SQL Server - agent | error

          o RDS for MySQL - audit | error | general | slowquery

          o RDS for Oracle - alert | audit | listener | trace | oemagent

          o RDS for PostgreSQL - postgresql | upgrade

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --processor-features (list)
          The  number  of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the
          DB instance class of the DB instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora or  RDS  Custom  DB  in-
          stances.

          (structure)
              Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

              To  specify  the  number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature
              name for the Name parameter. To specify the  number  of  threads
              per  core,  use the threadsPerCore feature name for the Name pa-
              rameter.

              You can set the processor features of the DB instance class  for
              a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

              o CreateDBInstance

              o ModifyDBInstance

              o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

              o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

              o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

              You  can  view  the  valid processor values for a particular in-
              stance class by calling  the  DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions
              action and specifying the instance class for the DBInstanceClass
              parameter.

              In addition, you can use the following actions for  DB  instance
              class processor information:

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribeDBSnapshots

              o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

              If  you  call  DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  returns
              non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

              o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

              o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the  number
                of CPU cores and threads per core.

              o The  current  number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-de-
                fault value.

              For more information, see Configuring the processor for a DB in-
              stance class in RDS for Oracle in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the processor feature. Valid names are coreCount
                 and threadsPerCore .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of a processor feature.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          Specifies whether the DB instance has deletion  protection  enabled.
          The  database  can't be deleted when deletion protection is enabled.
          By default, deletion protection isn't enabled. For more information,
          see Deleting a DB Instance .

          This  setting  doesn't  apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. You can
          enable or disable deletion protection for the DB cluster.  For  more
          information,  see CreateDBCluster . DB instances in a DB cluster can
          be deleted even when deletion protection is enabled for the DB clus-
          ter.

       --max-allocated-storage (integer)
          The upper limit in gibibytes (GiB) to which Amazon RDS can automati-
          cally scale the storage of the DB instance.

          For more information about this setting, including limitations  that
          apply  to  it,  see  Managing capacity automatically with Amazon RDS
          storage autoscaling in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          This setting doesn't apply to the following DB instances:

          o Amazon Aurora (Storage is managed by the DB cluster.)

          o RDS Custom

       --enable-customer-owned-ip | --no-enable-customer-owned-ip (boolean)
          Specifies whether to enable a customer-owned IP address  (CoIP)  for
          an RDS on Outposts DB instance.

          A  CoIP provides local or external connectivity to resources in your
          Outpost subnets through  your  on-premises  network.  For  some  use
          cases,  a  CoIP  can provide lower latency for connections to the DB
          instance from outside of its virtual private cloud (VPC) on your lo-
          cal network.

          For  more information about RDS on Outposts, see Working with Amazon
          RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          For more information about CoIPs, see Customer-owned IP addresses in
          the Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide .

       --custom-iam-instance-profile (string)
          The  instance  profile associated with the underlying Amazon EC2 in-
          stance of an RDS Custom DB instance.

          This setting is required for RDS Custom.

          Constraints:

          o The profile must exist in your account.

          o The profile must have an IAM role that Amazon EC2 has  permissions
            to assume.

          o The  instance  profile  name and the associated IAM role name must
            start with the prefix AWSRDSCustom .

          For the list of permissions required for the IAM role, see Configure
          IAM and your VPC in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

       --backup-target (string)
          The location for storing automated backups and manual snapshots.

          Valid Values:

          o outposts (Amazon Web Services Outposts)

          o region (Amazon Web Services Region)

          Default: region

          For more information, see Working with Amazon RDS on Amazon Web Ser-
          vices Outposts in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

       --network-type (string)
          The network type of the DB instance.

          The network type is determined by the  DBSubnetGroup  specified  for
          the  DB instance. A DBSubnetGroup can support only the IPv4 protocol
          or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (DUAL ).

          For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in the
          Amazon RDS User Guide.

          Valid Values: IPV4 | DUAL

       --storage-throughput (integer)
          The storage throughput value for the DB instance.

          This setting applies only to the gp3 storage type.

          This  setting  doesn't  apply  to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB in-
          stances.

       --manage-master-user-password | --no-manage-master-user-password (bool-
       ean)
          Specifies whether to manage the master user password with Amazon Web
          Services Secrets Manager.

          For more information, see Password management with Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices Secrets Manager in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          Constraints:

          o Can't manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Se-
            crets Manager if MasterUserPassword is specified.

       --master-user-secret-kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to encrypt a secret  that
          is  automatically  generated  and managed in Amazon Web Services Se-
          crets Manager.

          This setting is valid only if the master user password is managed by
          RDS in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the DB instance.

          The  Amazon  Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID,
          alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a dif-
          ferent  Amazon  Web  Services  account, specify the key ARN or alias
          ARN.

          If you don't specify MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId  ,  then  the  aws/se-
          cretsmanager KMS key is used to encrypt the secret. If the secret is
          in a different Amazon Web Services account, then you can't  use  the
          aws/secretsmanager KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use a
          customer managed KMS key.

          There is a default KMS key for your  Amazon  Web  Services  account.
          Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for
          each Amazon Web Services Region.

       --ca-certificate-identifier (string)
          The CA certificate identifier to use for the  DB  instance's  server
          certificate.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

          For more information, see Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a
          DB instance in the Amazon RDS User Guide and Using  SSL/TLS  to  en-
          crypt a connection to a DB cluster in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

       --db-system-id (string)
          The  Oracle system identifier (SID), which is the name of the Oracle
          database instance that manages your database files. In this context,
          the term "Oracle database instance" refers exclusively to the system
          global area (SGA) and Oracle  background  processes.  If  you  don't
          specify a SID, the value defaults to RDSCDB . The Oracle SID is also
          the name of your CDB.

       --dedicated-log-volume | --no-dedicated-log-volume (boolean)
          Indicates whether the DB instance has a dedicated log  volume  (DLV)
          enabled.

       --multi-tenant | --no-multi-tenant (boolean)
          Specifies  whether to use the multi-tenant configuration or the sin-
          gle-tenant configuration (default). This parameter only  applies  to
          RDS for Oracle container database (CDB) engines.

          Note the following restrictions:

          o The  DB  engine  that  you specify in the request must support the
            multi-tenant  configuration.  If  you  attempt   to   enable   the
            multi-tenant configuration on a DB engine that doesn't support it,
            the request fails.

          o If you specify the multi-tenant configuration when you create your
            DB  instance,  you  can't later modify this DB instance to use the
            single-tenant configuration.

       --engine-lifecycle-support (string)
          The life cycle type for this DB instance.

          NOTE:
              By default, this value is set  to  open-source-rds-extended-sup-
              port  ,  which enrolls your DB instance into Amazon RDS Extended
              Support. At the end of standard support, you can  avoid  charges
              for Extended Support by setting the value to open-source-rds-ex-
              tended-support-disabled . In this case, creating the DB instance
              will  fail  if  the DB major version is past its end of standard
              support date.

          This setting applies only to RDS for MySQL and RDS  for  PostgreSQL.
          For  Amazon  Aurora  DB instances, the life cycle type is managed by
          the DB cluster.

          You can use this setting to enroll your DB instance into Amazon  RDS
          Extended  Support.  With  RDS  Extended Support, you can run the se-
          lected major engine version on your DB  instance  past  the  end  of
          standard  support for that engine version. For more information, see
          Using Amazon RDS Extended Support in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          Valid Values: open-source-rds-extended-support | open-source-rds-ex-
          tended-support-disabled

          Default: open-source-rds-extended-support

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                     for the DBInstanceClass parameter.

                     In addition, you can use the following actions for DB in-
                     stance class processor information:

                     o DescribeDBInstances

                     o DescribeDBSnapshots

                     o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                     If  you  call  DescribeDBInstances , ProcessorFeature re-
                     turns non-null values only if  the  following  conditions
                     are met:

          PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

              When the DB instance is publicly accessible and you connect from
              outside of the DB instance's virtual private  cloud  (VPC),  its
              Domain  Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the public IP ad-
              dress. When you connect from within the same VPC as the  DB  in-
              stance,  the endpoint resolves to the private IP address. Access
              to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group
              it  uses.  That  public  access  isn't permitted if the security
              group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

              When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an  inter-
              nal  DB  instance  with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP
              address.

          NetworkType -> (string)
              The network type of the DB instance.

              The  network  type  is determined by the DBSubnetGroup specified
              for the DB instance. A DBSubnetGroup can support only  the  IPv4
              protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (DUAL ).

              For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in
              the Amazon RDS User Guide and Working with a DB  instance  in  a

                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret.

              SecretStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the secret.

                 The possible status values include the following:

                 o creating - The secret is being created.

                 o active  -  The secret is available for normal use and rota-
                   tion.

                 o rotating - The secret is being rotated.

                 o impaired - The secret can be used to access  database  cre-
                   dentials, but it can't be rotated. A secret might have this
                   status if, for example, permissions are changed so that RDS
                   can  no  longer access either the secret or the KMS key for
                   the secret. When a secret has this status, you can  correct
                   the condition that caused the status. Alternatively, modify
                   the DB instance to turn off automatic management  of  data-
                   base  credentials, and then modify the DB instance again to
                   turn on automatic management of database credentials.
