DESCRIBE-ACCOUNT-ATTRIBUTES()                    DESCRIBE-ACCOUNT-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       describe-account-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all of the attributes for a customer account. The attributes in-
       clude Amazon RDS quotas for the account, such as the number of  DB  in-
       stances  allowed.  The description for a quota includes the quota name,
       current usage toward that quota, and the quota's maximum value.

       This command doesn't take any parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-account-attributes
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       tributes for the current AWS account.

OUTPUT
       AccountQuotas -> (list)
          A  list  of AccountQuota objects. Within this list, each quota has a
          name, a count of usage toward the quota maximum, and a maximum value
          for the quota.

          (structure)
              Describes a quota for an Amazon Web Services account.

              The following are account quotas:

                per DB security group. The used value is the highest number of
                ingress  rules in a DB security group in the account. Other DB
                security groups in the account might have a  lower  number  of
                ingress rules.

              o CustomEndpointsPerDBCluster  -  The number of custom endpoints
                per DB cluster. The used value is the highest number of custom

              o DBClusterParameterGroups - The number of DB cluster  parameter
                groups  per  account,  excluding default parameter groups. The
                used value is the count of  nondefault  DB  cluster  parameter
                groups in the account.

              o DBClusterRoles  - The number of associated Amazon Web Services
                Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles per DB cluster. The
                used value is the highest number of associated IAM roles for a
                DB cluster in the account. Other DB clusters  in  the  account
                might have a lower number of associated IAM roles.

              o DBClusters  -  The number of DB clusters per account. The used
                value is the count of DB clusters in the account.

              o DBInstanceRoles - The number of associated IAM  roles  per  DB
                instance.  The  used value is the highest number of associated
                IAM roles for a DB instance in the account. Other DB instances

                quota.

              o DBParameterGroups - The number of DB parameter groups per  ac-
                count,  excluding  default parameter groups. The used value is
                the count of nondefault DB parameter groups in the account.

              o DBSecurityGroups - The number of DB security groups  (not  VPC
                security  groups)  per account, excluding the default security
                group. The used value is the count of nondefault  DB  security
                groups in the account.

                stance. The used value is the highest number of read  replicas
                for  a  DB  instance in the account. Other DB instances in the
                account might have a lower number of read replicas.

              o ReservedDBInstances - The number of reserved DB instances  per
                account. The used value is the count of the active reserved DB

              o SubnetsPerDBSubnetGroup - The number of subnets per DB  subnet
                group.  The  used  value is highest number of subnets for a DB
                subnet group in the account. Other DB subnet groups in the ac-
                count might have a lower number of subnets.
