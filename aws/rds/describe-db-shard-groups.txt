OPTIONS
       --db-shard-group-identifier (string)
          The  user-supplied  DB shard group identifier or the Amazon Resource
          Name (ARN) of the DB shard group. If this  parameter  is  specified,
          information  for  only the specific DB shard group is returned. This
          parameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match an existing DB shard group identifier.

       --filters (list)
          A filter that specifies one or more DB shard groups to describe.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribeDBRecommendations

              o DescribeDBShardGroups

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --marker (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous DescribeDBShard-
          Groups  request.  If  this  parameter is specified, the response in-
          cludes only records beyond the marker, up to the value specified  by
          MaxRecords .

       --max-records (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of records to include in the response. If more
          records exist than the specified MaxRecords value, a pagination  to-
          ken  called a marker is included in the response so you can retrieve
          the remaining results.

          Default: 100

          Constraints: Minimum 20, maximum 100

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       DBShardGroups -> (list)
          Contains a list of DB shard groups for the user.

          (structure)
              DBShardGroupResourceId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web Services Region-unique, immutable identifier
                 for the DB shard group.

              DBShardGroupIdentifier -> (string)
                 The name of the DB shard group.

              DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                 The name of the primary DB cluster for the DB shard group.

              MaxACU -> (double)
                 The maximum capacity of the DB shard group in Aurora capacity
                 units (ACUs).

              ComputeRedundancy -> (integer)
                 Specifies  whether  to  create  standby  instances for the DB
                 shard group. Valid values are the following:

                 o 0 - Creates a single, primary DB instance for each physical
                   shard.  This  is  the  default value, and the only one sup-
                   ported for the preview.

                 o 1 - Creates a primary DB instance and a standby instance in
                   a different Availability Zone (AZ) for each physical shard.

                 o 2 - Creates a primary DB instance and two standby instances
                   in different AZs for each physical shard.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the DB shard group.

              PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the DB shard group is publicly accessible.

                 When the DB shard group is publicly  accessible,  its  Domain
                 Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address
                 from within the DB shard group's virtual private cloud (VPC).
                 It  resolves  to the public IP address from outside of the DB
                 shard group's VPC. Access to the DB shard group is ultimately
                 controlled  by the security group it uses. That public access
                 isn't permitted if the security  group  assigned  to  the  DB
                 shard group doesn't permit it.

                 When  the  DB shard group isn't publicly accessible, it is an
                 internal DB shard group with a DNS name that  resolves  to  a
                 private IP address.

                 For more information, see  CreateDBShardGroup .

                 This setting is only for Aurora Limitless Database.

              Endpoint -> (string)
                 The connection endpoint for the DB shard group.

       Marker -> (string)
          A  pagination  token  that can be used in a later DescribeDBClusters
          request.
