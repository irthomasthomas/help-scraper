SWITCHOVER-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()                        SWITCHOVER-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()



NAME
       switchover-global-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Switches  over the specified secondary DB cluster to be the new primary
       DB cluster in the global database cluster. Switchover  operations  were
       previously called "managed planned failovers."

       Aurora   promotes  the  specified  secondary  cluster  to  assume  full
       read/write capabilities and demotes the current primary  cluster  to  a
       secondary  (read-only)  cluster,  maintaining  the  orginal replication
       topology. All secondary clusters are synchronized with the  primary  at
       the  beginning  of  the process so the new primary continues operations
       for the Aurora global database without losing any data.  Your  database
       is  unavailable  for  a  short time while the primary and selected sec-
       ondary clusters are assuming their  new  roles.  For  more  information
       about   switching  over  an  Aurora  global  database,  see  Performing
       switchovers for Amazon Aurora global databases  in  the  Amazon  Aurora
       User Guide .

       NOTE:
          This  operation  is intended for controlled environments, for opera-
          tions such as "regional rotation" or to fall back  to  the  original
          primary after a global database failover.

OPTIONS
       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  of the global database cluster to switch over. This
          parameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing global  database  cluster
            (Aurora global database).

       --target-db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  identifier of the secondary Aurora DB cluster to promote to the
          new primary for the global database cluster. Use the Amazon Resource
          Name  (ARN) for the identifier so that Aurora can locate the cluster
          in its Amazon Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

              an in-process or pending switchover or failover process for this
              global cluster (Aurora global database). This  object  is  empty
              unless  the SwitchoverGlobalCluster or FailoverGlobalCluster op-
              eration was called on this global cluster.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of the global cluster. Possible values are
                 as follows:

                 o pending   The  service received a request to switch over or
                   fail over the global cluster. The global cluster's  primary
                   DB cluster and the specified secondary DB cluster are being
                   verified before the operation starts.

                 o failing-over  Aurora is promoting the chosen secondary  Au-
                   rora  DB  cluster  to  become the new primary DB cluster to
                   fail over the global cluster.

                 o cancelling  The request to switch over  or  fail  over  the
                   global  cluster  was  cancelled  and  the primary Aurora DB
                   cluster and the selected secondary Aurora  DB  cluster  are
                   returning to their previous states.

                 o switching-over   This status covers the range of Aurora in-
                   ternal operations that take  place  during  the  switchover
                   process,  such  as  demoting the primary Aurora DB cluster,
                   promoting the secondary Aurora DB cluster, and  synchroniz-
                   ing replicas.

              FromDbClusterArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Aurora DB cluster that
                 is currently being demoted, and which is associated with this
                 state.

              ToDbClusterArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Aurora DB cluster that
                 is currently being promoted, and  which  is  associated  with
                 this state.

              IsDataLossAllowed -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  the operation is a global switchover or a
                 global failover. If data loss is allowed, then the  operation
                 is a global failover. Otherwise, it's a switchover.

          TagList -> (list)
              A list of tags.

              For  more  information,  see Tagging Amazon RDS resources in the
              Amazon RDS User Guide or Tagging Amazon Aurora  and  Amazon  RDS
              resources in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

              (structure)
                 Metadata  assigned  to an Amazon RDS resource consisting of a
                 key-value pair.

                     can't be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only
                     contain   only   the  set  of  Unicode  letters,  digits,
                     white-space, '_', '.', ':', '/', '=', '+', '-', '@' (Java
                     regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

                 Value -> (string)
                     A  value  is  the  optional  value of the tag. The string
                     value can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters  in  length
                     and  can't be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can
                     only contain only the set  of  Unicode  letters,  digits,
