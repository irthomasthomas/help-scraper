       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            add-role-to-db-instance
          --db-instance-identifier <value>
          --role-arn <value>
          --feature-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The name of the DB instance to associate the IAM role with.

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to associate with the
          DB instance, for example arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AccessRole .

       --feature-name (string)
          The name of the feature for the DB instance that the IAM role is  to
          be  associated  with. For information about supported feature names,
          see  DBEngineVersion .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
