DELETE-DB-INSTANCE()                                      DELETE-DB-INSTANCE()



NAME
       delete-db-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a previously provisioned DB instance. When you delete a DB in-
       stance, all automated backups for that instance are deleted  and  can't
       be  recovered.  However,  manual DB snapshots of the DB instance aren't
       deleted.

       If you request a final DB snapshot, the status of the Amazon RDS DB in-
       stance  is  deleting  until  the DB snapshot is created. This operation
       can't be canceled or reverted after it begins. To monitor the status of
       this operation, use DescribeDBInstance .

       When  a  DB instance is in a failure state and has a status of failed ,
       incompatible-restore , or incompatible-network , you can only delete it
       when you skip creation of the final snapshot with the SkipFinalSnapshot
       parameter.

       If the specified DB instance is part of an Amazon  Aurora  DB  cluster,
       you  can't  delete  the DB instance if both of the following conditions
       are true:

       o The DB cluster is a read replica of another Amazon Aurora DB cluster.

       o The DB instance is the only instance in the DB cluster.

       To delete a DB instance in this case, first use  the  PromoteReadRepli-
       caDBCluster  operation to promote the DB cluster so that it's no longer
       a read replica. After the promotion completes, use the DeleteDBInstance
       operation to delete the final instance in the DB cluster.

       WARNING:
          For  RDS  Custom  DB instances, deleting the DB instance permanently
          deletes the EC2 instance and the associated EBS volumes.  Make  sure
          that you don't terminate or delete these resources before you delete
          the DB instance. Otherwise, deleting the DB instance and creation of
          the final snapshot might fail.

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The  DB  instance identifier for the DB instance to be deleted. This
          parameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the name of an existing DB instance.

       --skip-final-snapshot | --no-skip-final-snapshot (boolean)
          Specifies whether to skip the creation of a final DB snapshot before
          deleting  the  instance.  If  you enable this parameter, RDS doesn't
          create a DB snapshot. If you don't enable this parameter,  RDS  cre-
          ates  a  DB  snapshot before the DB instance is deleted. By default,
          skip isn't enabled, and the DB snapshot is created.

          NOTE:
              If you don't enable this parameter, you  must  specify  the  Fi-
              nalDBSnapshotIdentifier parameter.

          When  a DB instance is in a failure state and has a status of failed
          , incompatible-restore , or incompatible-network ,  RDS  can  delete
          the instance only if you enable this parameter.

          If you delete a read replica or an RDS Custom instance, you must en-
          able this setting.

          This setting is required for RDS Custom.

       --final-db-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The DBSnapshotIdentifier of the  new  DBSnapshot  created  when  the
          SkipFinalSnapshot parameter is disabled.

          NOTE:
              If  you enable this parameter and also enable SkipFinalShapshot,
              the command results in an error.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Constraints:

          o Must be 1 to 255 letters or numbers.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          o Can't be specified when deleting a read replica.

       --delete-automated-backups | --no-delete-automated-backups (boolean)
          Specifies whether to remove automated backups immediately after  the
          DB instance is deleted. This parameter isn't case-sensitive. The de-
          fault is to remove automated backups immediately after  the  DB  in-
          stance is deleted.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User

                 for the DB instance class of the DB instance.

                 (structure)
                     Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

                     To specify the number of CPU  cores,  use  the  coreCount
                     feature  name for the Name parameter. To specify the num-
                     ber of threads per core, use the  threadsPerCore  feature
                     name for the Name parameter.

                     You  can  set  the  processor features of the DB instance
                     class for a DB instance when you call one of the  follow-
                     ing actions:

                     o CreateDBInstance

                     o ModifyDBInstance

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

                     o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

                     You  can view the valid processor values for a particular
                     instance  class  by  calling  the  DescribeOrderableDBIn-
                     stanceOptions  action  and  specifying the instance class
                     for the DBInstanceClass parameter.

                     In addition, you can use the following actions for DB in-
                     stance class processor information:

                     o DescribeDBInstances

                     o DescribeDBSnapshots

                     o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                     If  you  call  DescribeDBInstances , ProcessorFeature re-
                     turns non-null values only if  the  following  conditions
                     are met:

                     o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                     o Your  Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the
                       number of CPU cores and threads per core.

                     o The current number CPU cores and threads is  set  to  a
                       non-default value.

              When the DB instance is publicly accessible and you connect from
              outside of the DB instance's virtual private  cloud  (VPC),  its
              Domain  Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the public IP ad-
              dress. When you connect from within the same VPC as the  DB  in-
              stance,  the endpoint resolves to the private IP address. Access
              to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group
              it  uses.  That  public  access  isn't permitted if the security
              group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

              When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an  inter-
              nal  DB  instance  with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP
              address.

                 You can view the valid processor values for a particular  in-
                 stance  class  by  calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOp-
                 tions action and specifying the instance class for the  DBIn-
                 stanceClass parameter.

                 In  addition,  you  can  use the following actions for DB in-
                 stance class processor information:

                 o DescribeDBInstances

                 o DescribeDBSnapshots

                 o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                 If you call DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  returns
                 non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

                 o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                 o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the num-
                   ber of CPU cores and threads per core.

                 o The current number CPU  cores  and  threads  is  set  to  a
                   non-default value.

              SecretStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the secret.

                 The possible status values include the following:

                 o creating - The secret is being created.

                 o active  -  The secret is available for normal use and rota-
                   tion.

                 o rotating - The secret is being rotated.

                   dentials, but it can't be rotated. A secret might have this
                   status if, for example, permissions are changed so that RDS
                   can  no  longer access either the secret or the KMS key for
                   the secret. When a secret has this status, you can  correct
                   the condition that caused the status. Alternatively, modify
                   the DB instance to turn off automatic management  of  data-
                   base  credentials, and then modify the DB instance again to
                   turn on automatic management of database credentials.
