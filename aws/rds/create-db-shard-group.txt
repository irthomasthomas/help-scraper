OPTIONS
       --db-shard-group-identifier (string)
          The name of the DB shard group.

       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The name of the primary DB cluster for the DB shard group.

       --compute-redundancy (integer)
          Specifies whether to create  standby  instances  for  the  DB  shard
          group. Valid values are the following:

          o 0 - Creates a single, primary DB instance for each physical shard.
            This is the default value, and the only one supported for the pre-
            view.

          o 1 - Creates a primary DB instance and a standby instance in a dif-
            ferent Availability Zone (AZ) for each physical shard.

          o 2 - Creates a primary DB instance and  two  standby  instances  in
            different AZs for each physical shard.

       --max-acu (double)
          The  maximum capacity of the DB shard group in Aurora capacity units
          (ACUs).

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          Specifies whether the DB shard group is publicly accessible.

          When the DB shard group is publicly accessible, its Domain Name Sys-
          tem  (DNS)  endpoint  resolves to the private IP address from within
          the DB shard group's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the
          public  IP  address from outside of the DB shard group's VPC. Access
          to the DB shard group is ultimately controlled by the security group
          it  uses.  That public access is not permitted if the security group
          assigned to the DB shard group doesn't permit it.

          When the DB shard group isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal
          DB  shard  group  with  a DNS name that resolves to a private IP ad-
          dress.

          Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether  DBSubnet-
          GroupName is specified.

          If  DBSubnetGroupName  isn't specified, and PubliclyAccessible isn't
          specified, the following applies:

          o If the default VPC in the target Region doesnt  have  an  internet
            gateway attached to it, the DB shard group is private.

          o If  the  default  VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway
            attached to it, the DB shard group is public.

          If DBSubnetGroupName  is  specified,  and  PubliclyAccessible  isn't
          specified, the following applies:

          o If  the  subnets  are  part  of a VPC that doesnt have an internet
            gateway attached to it, the DB shard group is private.

          o If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway  at-
            tached to it, the DB shard group is public.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          The Amazon Web Services Region-unique, immutable identifier for  the
          DB shard group.

          The name of the DB shard group.

       DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
          The name of the primary DB cluster for the DB shard group.

       MaxACU -> (double)
          The  maximum capacity of the DB shard group in Aurora capacity units
          (ACUs).

       ComputeRedundancy -> (integer)
          Specifies whether to create  standby  instances  for  the  DB  shard
          group. Valid values are the following:

          o 0 - Creates a single, primary DB instance for each physical shard.
            This is the default value, and the only one supported for the pre-
            view.

            ferent Availability Zone (AZ) for each physical shard.

            different AZs for each physical shard.

          The status of the DB shard group.

       PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether the DB shard group is publicly accessible.

          When the DB shard group is publicly accessible, its Domain Name Sys-
          tem (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP  address  from  within
          the DB shard group's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the
          public IP address from outside of the DB shard group's  VPC.  Access
          to the DB shard group is ultimately controlled by the security group
          it uses. That public access isn't permitted if  the  security  group
          assigned to the DB shard group doesn't permit it.

          When the DB shard group isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal
          DB shard group with a DNS name that resolves to  a  private  IP  ad-
          dress.
