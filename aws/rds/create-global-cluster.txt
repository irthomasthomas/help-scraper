CREATE-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()                                CREATE-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()



NAME
       create-global-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  Aurora  global  database spread across multiple Amazon Web
       Services Regions. The global database contains a single primary cluster
       with  read-write capability, and a read-only secondary cluster that re-
       ceives data from the primary  cluster  through  high-speed  replication
       performed by the Aurora storage subsystem.

       You  can create a global database that is initially empty, and then add
       a primary cluster and a secondary cluster to it. Or you can specify  an
       existing  Aurora  cluster during the create operation, and this cluster
       becomes the primary cluster of the global database.

       NOTE:
          This operation applies only to Aurora DB clusters.

OPTIONS
       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The cluster identifier for this global database cluster. This param-
          eter is stored as a lowercase string.

       --source-db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to use as the primary cluster of the
          global database.

          If you provide a value for this parameter, don't specify values  for
          the  following  settings  because Amazon Aurora uses the values from
          the specified source DB cluster:

          o DatabaseName

          o Engine

          o EngineVersion

          o StorageEncrypted

       --engine (string)
          The database engine to use for this global database cluster.

          Valid Values: aurora-mysql | aurora-postgresql

          Constraints:

          o Can't be specified if SourceDBClusterIdentifier is  specified.  In
            this case, Amazon Aurora uses the engine of the source DB cluster.

       --engine-version (string)
          The engine version to use for this global database cluster.

          Constraints:

          o Can't  be  specified if SourceDBClusterIdentifier is specified. In
            this case, Amazon Aurora uses the engine version of the source  DB
            cluster.

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  to enable deletion protection for the new global
          database cluster. The global database can't be deleted when deletion
          protection is enabled.

       --database-name (string)
          The  name  for your database of up to 64 alphanumeric characters. If
          you don't specify a name, Amazon Aurora doesn't create a database in
          the global database cluster.

          Constraints:

          o Can't  be  specified if SourceDBClusterIdentifier is specified. In
            this case, Amazon Aurora uses the database name from the source DB
            cluster.

       --storage-encrypted | --no-storage-encrypted (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  to  enable storage encryption for the new global
          database cluster.

          Constraints:

          o Can't be specified if SourceDBClusterIdentifier is  specified.  In
            this case, Amazon Aurora uses the setting from the source DB clus-
            ter.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 o failing-over  This status covers the range of Aurora inter-
                   nal operations that take place during the failover process,
                   such as demoting the primary Aurora DB  cluster,  promoting
