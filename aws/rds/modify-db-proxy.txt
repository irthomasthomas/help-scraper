          The new identifier for the DBProxy . An identifier must begin with a
          letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens;  it
          can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

       --auth (list)
          The new authentication settings for the DBProxy .

          (structure)
              Specifies  the  details of authentication used by a proxy to log
              in as a specific database user.

              Description -> (string)
                 A user-specified description about the authentication used by
                 a proxy to log in as a specific database user.

              UserName -> (string)
                 The name of the database user to which the proxy connects.

              AuthScheme -> (string)
                 The  type  of  authentication that the proxy uses for connec-
                 tions from the proxy to the underlying database.

              SecretArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) representing the  secret  that
                 the  proxy uses to authenticate to the RDS DB instance or Au-
                 rora DB cluster. These secrets are stored within  Amazon  Se-
                 crets Manager.

              IAMAuth -> (string)
                 A  value that indicates whether to require or disallow Amazon
                 Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentica-
                 tion for connections to the proxy. The ENABLED value is valid
                 only for proxies with RDS for Microsoft SQL Server.

              ClientPasswordAuthType -> (string)
                 The type of authentication the  proxy  uses  for  connections
                 from clients.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Description=string,UserName=string,AuthScheme=string,SecretArn=string,IAMAuth=string,ClientPasswordAuthType=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Description": "string",
              "UserName": "string",
              "AuthScheme": "SECRETS",
              "SecretArn": "string",
              "IAMAuth": "DISABLED"|"REQUIRED"|"ENABLED",
              "ClientPasswordAuthType": "MYSQL_NATIVE_PASSWORD"|"POSTGRES_SCRAM_SHA_256"|"POSTGRES_MD5"|"SQL_SERVER_AUTHENTICATION"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --require-tls | --no-require-tls (boolean)
          Whether  Transport  Layer  Security (TLS) encryption is required for
          connections to the proxy. By enabling this setting, you can  enforce
          encrypted TLS connections to the proxy, even if the associated data-
          base doesn't use TLS.

       --idle-client-timeout (integer)
          The number of seconds that a connection to the proxy can be inactive
          before  the  proxy  disconnects it. You can set this value higher or
          lower than the connection timeout limit for the associated database.

       --debug-logging | --no-debug-logging (boolean)
          Whether the proxy includes detailed information about SQL statements
          in  its  logs.  This information helps you to debug issues involving
          SQL behavior or the performance and scalability of the proxy connec-
          tions.  The  debug  information  includes the text of SQL statements
          that you submit through the proxy. Thus, only  enable  this  setting
          when  needed for debugging, and only when you have security measures
          in place to safeguard any sensitive information that appears in  the
          logs.

       --role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that the proxy uses
          to access secrets in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.

       --security-groups (list)
          The new list of security groups for the DBProxy .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 in as a specific database user.

                 Description -> (string)
                     A user-specified  description  about  the  authentication
                     used by a proxy to log in as a specific database user.

                 UserName -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  database user to which the proxy con-
                     nects.

                 AuthScheme -> (string)
                     The type of authentication that the proxy uses  for  con-
                     nections from the proxy to the underlying database.

                 SecretArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) representing the secret
                     that the proxy uses to authenticate to  the  RDS  DB  in-
                     stance  or  Aurora  DB  cluster. These secrets are stored
                     within Amazon Secrets Manager.

                 IAMAuth -> (string)
                     Whether to require or disallow Amazon Web Services  Iden-

              base client application.

          RequireTLS -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether  Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is
              required for connections to the proxy.

          IdleClientTimeout -> (integer)
              The number of seconds a connection to the proxy can have no  ac-
              tivity  before  the proxy drops the client connection. The proxy
              keeps the underlying database connection open and puts  it  back
              into the connection pool for reuse by later connection requests.

              Default: 1800 (30 minutes)

              Constraints: 1 to 28,800

          DebugLogging -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether the proxy includes detailed information about
              SQL statements in its logs. This information helps you to  debug
              issues involving SQL behavior or the performance and scalability
              of the proxy connections. The  debug  information  includes  the
              text  of SQL statements that you submit through the proxy. Thus,
              only enable this setting when needed  for  debugging,  and  only
              when you have security measures in place to safeguard any sensi-
              tive information that appears in the logs.

          CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the proxy was first created.

          UpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the proxy was last updated.
