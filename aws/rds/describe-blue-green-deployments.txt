NAME
       describe-blue-green-deployments -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes one or more blue/green deployments.

       For  more  information, see Using Amazon RDS Blue/Green Deployments for
       database updates in the Amazon RDS User  Guide  and  Using  Amazon  RDS
       Blue/Green  Deployments  for database updates in the Amazon Aurora User
       Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-blue-green-deployments is a paginated operation. Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: BlueGreenDeployments

OPTIONS
       --blue-green-deployment-identifier (string)
          The blue/green deployment identifier. If you specify this parameter,
          the response only includes information about the specific blue/green
          deployment. This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must match an existing blue/green deployment identifier.

       --filters (list)
          A  filter  that  specifies one or more blue/green deployments to de-
          scribe.

          Valid Values:

          o blue-green-deployment-identifier - Accepts system-generated  iden-
            tifiers for blue/green deployments. The results list only includes
            information about the blue/green deployments  with  the  specified
            identifiers.

          o blue-green-deployment-name   -  Accepts  user-supplied  names  for
            blue/green deployments. The results list only includes information
            about the blue/green deployments with the specified names.

          o source - Accepts source databases for a blue/green deployment. The
            results list only includes information about  the  blue/green  de-
            ployments with the specified source databases.

          o target - Accepts target databases for a blue/green deployment. The
            results list only includes information about  the  blue/green  de-
            ployments with the specified target databases.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              IDs. The filters supported by a  describe  operation  are  docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribeDBRecommendations

              o DescribeDBShardGroups

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       BlueGreenDeployments -> (list)
          A  list  of blue/green deployments in the current account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

          (structure)
              Details about a blue/green deployment.

              the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

              BlueGreenDeploymentIdentifier -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the blue/green deployment.

              BlueGreenDeploymentName -> (string)
                 The user-supplied name of the blue/green deployment.

              Source -> (string)
                 The source database for the blue/green deployment.

                 Before  switchover,  the  source  database  is the production
                 database in the blue environment.

              Target -> (string)
                 The target database for the blue/green deployment.
