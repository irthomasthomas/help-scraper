OPTIONS
       --db-shard-group-identifier (string)
          Teh name of the DB shard group to delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To delete a DB shard group unsuccessfully

       The following delete-db-shard-group example shows the error that occurs
       when  you  try  to  delete a DB shard group before deleting all of your
       databases and schemas.

          aws rds delete-db-shard-group \
              --db-shard-group-identifier limitless-test-shard-grp

       Output:

          An error occurred (InvalidDBShardGroupState) when calling the DeleteDBShardGroup operation: Unable to delete the DB shard group limitless-test-db-shard-group.
          Delete all of your Limitless Database databases and schemas, then try again.

       Example 2: To delete a DB shard group successfully

       The following delete-db-shard-group example deletes a  DB  shard  group
       after  you've  deleted all of your databases and schemas, including the
       public schema.

          aws rds delete-db-shard-group \
              --db-shard-group-identifier limitless-test-shard-grp

       Output:

          {
              "DBShardGroupResourceId": "shardgroup-7bb446329da94788b3f957746example",
              "DBShardGroupIdentifier": "limitless-test-shard-grp",
              "DBClusterIdentifier": "limitless-test-cluster",
              "MaxACU": 768.0,
              "ComputeRedundancy": 0,
              "Status": "deleting",
              "PubliclyAccessible": true,
              "Endpoint": "limitless-test-cluster.limitless-cekycexample.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com"
          }

       in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

OUTPUT
       DBShardGroupResourceId -> (string)
          The  Amazon Web Services Region-unique, immutable identifier for the
          DB shard group.

       DBShardGroupIdentifier -> (string)
          The name of the DB shard group.

       DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
          The name of the primary DB cluster for the DB shard group.

       MaxACU -> (double)
          The maximum capacity of the DB shard group in Aurora capacity  units
          (ACUs).

       MinACU -> (double)
          The  minimum capacity of the DB shard group in Aurora capacity units
          (ACUs).

       ComputeRedundancy -> (integer)
          Specifies whether to create standby DB shard groups for the DB shard
          group. Valid values are the following:

          o 0  -  Creates  a  DB shard group without a standby DB shard group.
            This is the default value.

          o 1 - Creates a DB shard group with a standby DB shard  group  in  a
            different Availability Zone (AZ).

          o 2  -  Creates a DB shard group with two standby DB shard groups in
            two different AZs.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the DB shard group.

       PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether the DB shard group is publicly accessible.

          When the DB shard group is publicly accessible, its Domain Name Sys-
          tem  (DNS)  endpoint  resolves to the private IP address from within
          the DB shard group's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the
          public  IP  address from outside of the DB shard group's VPC. Access
          to the DB shard group is ultimately controlled by the security group
          it  uses.  That  public access isn't permitted if the security group
          assigned to the DB shard group doesn't permit it.

          When the DB shard group isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal
          DB  shard  group  with  a DNS name that resolves to a private IP ad-
          dress.

          For more information, see  CreateDBShardGroup .

          This setting is only for Aurora Limitless Database.

       Endpoint -> (string)
          The connection endpoint for the DB shard group.

       DBShardGroupArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the DB shard group.
