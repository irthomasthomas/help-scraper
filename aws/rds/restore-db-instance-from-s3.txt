NAME
       restore-db-instance-from-s3 -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Relational  Database  Service  (Amazon  RDS) supports importing
       MySQL databases by using backup files. You can create a backup of  your
       on-premises database, store it on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon
       S3), and then restore the backup file onto a new Amazon RDS DB instance
       running  MySQL. For more information, see Importing Data into an Amazon
       RDS MySQL DB Instance in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

       This operation doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

          When  the DB instance is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System
          (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB
          instance's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP
          address from outside of the DB instance's VPC. Access to the DB  in-
          stance  is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That
          public access is not permitted if the security group assigned to the
          DB instance doesn't permit it.

          When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
          instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

          For more information, see  CreateDBInstance .

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"

          ferent Amazon Web Services account, specify the  key  ARN  or  alias
          ARN.

          If the StorageEncrypted parameter is enabled, and you do not specify
          a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, then Amazon RDS  will  use  your
          default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Ser-
          vices account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different  de-
          fault KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

       --copy-tags-to-snapshot | --no-copy-tags-to-snapshot (boolean)
          Specifies whether to copy all tags from the DB instance to snapshots

          toringInterval to a value other than 0.

          Valid Values: 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60

          Default: 0

       --monitoring-role-arn (string)
          The  ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitor-
          ing   metrics   to   Amazon   CloudWatch    Logs.    For    example,
          arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess . For information on creating
          a monitoring role, see Setting Up and Enabling  Enhanced  Monitoring
          in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          If  MonitoringInterval is set to a value other than 0, then you must
          supply a MonitoringRoleArn value.

       --enable-iam-database-authentication | --no-enable-iam-database-authen-
       tication (boolean)
          Specifies  whether to enable mapping of Amazon Web Services Identity
          and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database  accounts.  By  de-
          fault, mapping isn't enabled.

              per  core,  use the threadsPerCore feature name for the Name pa-
              rameter.

              You can set the processor features of the DB instance class  for
              a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

              o CreateDBInstance

              o ModifyDBInstance

              o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

              o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

              o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

              You  can  view  the  valid processor values for a particular in-
              stance class by calling  the  DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions
              action and specifying the instance class for the DBInstanceClass
              parameter.

              In addition, you can use the following actions for  DB  instance
              class processor information:

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribeDBSnapshots

              o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

              If  you  call  DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  returns
              non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

              o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

              o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the  number
                of CPU cores and threads per core.

              o The  current  number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-de-
                fault value.

              For more information, see Configuring the processor for a DB in-
              stance class in RDS for Oracle in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the processor feature. Valid names are coreCount

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --use-default-processor-features |  --no-use-default-processor-features
       (boolean)
          Specifies  whether the DB instance class of the DB instance uses its
          default processor features.

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          Specifies whether to enable deletion protection for the DB instance.
          The  database  can't be deleted when deletion protection is enabled.
          By default, deletion protection isn't enabled. For more information,
          see Deleting a DB Instance .

       --max-allocated-storage (integer)
          The upper limit in gibibytes (GiB) to which Amazon RDS can automati-
          cally scale the storage of the DB instance.

          For more information about this setting, including limitations  that
          apply  to  it,  see  Managing capacity automatically with Amazon RDS
          storage autoscaling in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

       --network-type (string)
          The network type of the DB instance.

          Valid Values:

          o IPV4

          o DUAL

          The network type is determined by the  DBSubnetGroup  specified  for
          the  DB instance. A DBSubnetGroup can support only the IPv4 protocol
          or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (DUAL ).

          For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in the
          Amazon RDS User Guide.

       --storage-throughput (integer)
          Specifies the storage throughput value for the DB instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom or Amazon Aurora.

       ean)
          Specifies whether to manage the master user password with Amazon Web
          Services Secrets Manager.

          For  more  information, see Password management with Amazon Web Ser-
          vices Secrets Manager in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          Constraints:

          o Can't manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Se-
            crets Manager if MasterUserPassword is specified.

       --master-user-secret-kms-key-id (string)
          The  Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to encrypt a secret that
          is automatically generated and managed in Amazon  Web  Services  Se-
          crets Manager.

          This setting is valid only if the master user password is managed by
          RDS in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the DB instance.

          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN,  key  ID,
          alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a dif-
          ferent Amazon Web Services account, specify the  key  ARN  or  alias
          ARN.

          If  you  don't  specify  MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId , then the aws/se-
          cretsmanager KMS key is used to encrypt the secret. If the secret is
          in  a  different Amazon Web Services account, then you can't use the
          aws/secretsmanager KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use a
          customer managed KMS key.

          There  is  a  default  KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account.
          Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for
          each Amazon Web Services Region.

       --dedicated-log-volume | --no-dedicated-log-volume (boolean)
          Specifies  whether to enable a dedicated log volume (DLV) for the DB
          instance.

          The CA certificate identifier to use for the  DB  instance's  server
          certificate.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

          For more information, see Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a
          DB instance in the Amazon RDS User Guide and Using  SSL/TLS  to  en-
          crypt a connection to a DB cluster in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

       --engine-lifecycle-support (string)
          The life cycle type for this DB instance.

          NOTE:
              By  default,  this value is set to open-source-rds-extended-sup-
              port , which enrolls your DB instance into Amazon  RDS  Extended
              Support.  At  the end of standard support, you can avoid charges
              for Extended Support by setting the value to open-source-rds-ex-
              tended-support-disabled  .  In  this case, RDS automatically up-
              grades your restored DB instance to a higher engine version,  if
              the  major  engine  version  is past its end of standard support
              date.

          You can use this setting to enroll your DB instance into Amazon  RDS
          Extended  Support.  With  RDS  Extended Support, you can run the se-
          lected major engine version on your DB  instance  past  the  end  of
          standard  support for that engine version. For more information, see
          Using Amazon RDS Extended Support in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          This setting applies only to RDS for MySQL and RDS  for  PostgreSQL.
          For  Amazon  Aurora  DB instances, the life cycle type is managed by
          the DB cluster.

          Valid Values: open-source-rds-extended-support | open-source-rds-ex-
          tended-support-disabled

          Default: open-source-rds-extended-support

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                     Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

                     To specify the number of CPU  cores,  use  the  coreCount
                     feature  name for the Name parameter. To specify the num-
                     ber of threads per core, use the  threadsPerCore  feature
                     name for the Name parameter.

                     You  can  set  the  processor features of the DB instance
                     class for a DB instance when you call one of the  follow-
                     ing actions:

                     o CreateDBInstance

                     o ModifyDBInstance

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

                     o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

                     You  can view the valid processor values for a particular
                     instance  class  by  calling  the  DescribeOrderableDBIn-
                     stanceOptions  action  and  specifying the instance class
                     for the DBInstanceClass parameter.

                     In addition, you can use the following actions for DB in-
                     stance class processor information:

                     o DescribeDBInstances

                     o DescribeDBSnapshots

                     o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                     If  you  call  DescribeDBInstances , ProcessorFeature re-
                     turns non-null values only if  the  following  conditions
                     are met:

                     o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                     o Your  Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the
                       number of CPU cores and threads per core.

                     o The current number CPU cores and threads is  set  to  a
                       non-default value.

              When the DB instance is publicly accessible and you connect from
              outside of the DB instance's virtual private  cloud  (VPC),  its
              Domain  Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the public IP ad-
              dress. When you connect from within the same VPC as the  DB  in-
              stance,  the endpoint resolves to the private IP address. Access
              to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group
              it  uses.  That  public  access  isn't permitted if the security
              group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

              When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an  inter-
              nal  DB  instance  with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP
              address.

              For more information, see  CreateDBInstance .

                 Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

                 To specify the number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature
                 name for the Name parameter. To specify the number of threads
                 per core, use the threadsPerCore feature name  for  the  Name
                 parameter.

                 You  can  set the processor features of the DB instance class
                 for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

                 o CreateDBInstance

                 o ModifyDBInstance

                 o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                 o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

                 You can view the valid processor values for a particular  in-
                 stance  class  by  calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOp-
                 tions action and specifying the instance class for the  DBIn-
                 stanceClass parameter.

                 stance class processor information:

                 o DescribeDBInstances

                 o DescribeDBSnapshots

                 o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                 If you call DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  returns
                 non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

                 o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                 o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the num-
                   ber of CPU cores and threads per core.

                 o The current number CPU  cores  and  threads  is  set  to  a
                   non-default value.

                   can no longer access either the secret or the KMS  key  for
                   the  secret. When a secret has this status, you can correct
                   the condition that caused the status. Alternatively, modify
                   the  DB  instance to turn off automatic management of data-
                   base credentials, and then modify the DB instance again  to
