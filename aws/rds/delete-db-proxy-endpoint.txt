DELETE-DB-PROXY-ENDPOINT()                          DELETE-DB-PROXY-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       delete-db-proxy-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a DBProxyEndpoint . Doing so removes the ability to access the
       DB proxy using the endpoint that you defined.  The  endpoint  that  you
       delete might have provided capabilities such as read/write or read-only
       operations, or using a different VPC than the DB proxy's default VPC.

OPTIONS
       --db-proxy-endpoint-name (string)
          The name of the DB proxy endpoint to delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       DBProxyEndpoint -> (structure)
          The data structure representing the details of the DB proxy endpoint
          that you delete.

          DBProxyEndpointName -> (string)
              The name for the DB proxy endpoint.  An  identifier  must  begin
              with  a  letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and
              hyphens; it can't end with a hyphen or contain  two  consecutive
              hyphens.

          DBProxyEndpointArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the DB proxy endpoint.

          DBProxyName -> (string)
              The  identifier for the DB proxy that is associated with this DB
              proxy endpoint.

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of this DB proxy endpoint. A status of avail-
              able  means the endpoint is ready to handle requests. Other val-
              ues indicate that you must wait for the endpoint to be ready, or
              take some action to resolve an issue.

          VpcId -> (string)
              Provides the VPC ID of the DB proxy endpoint.

          VpcSecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              Provides  a  list  of VPC security groups that the DB proxy end-
              point belongs to.

              (string)

          VpcSubnetIds -> (list)
              The EC2 subnet IDs for the DB proxy endpoint.

              (string)

          Endpoint -> (string)
              The endpoint that you can use to connect to the  DB  proxy.  You
              include  the endpoint value in the connection string for a data-
              base client application.

          CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the DB proxy endpoint was first created.

          TargetRole -> (string)
              A value that indicates whether the DB proxy endpoint can be used
              for read/write or read-only operations.

          IsDefault -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether this endpoint is the default endpoint for the
              associated DB proxy. Default  DB  proxy  endpoints  always  have
              read/write  capability.  Other endpoints that you associate with
              the DB proxy can be either read/write or read-only.
