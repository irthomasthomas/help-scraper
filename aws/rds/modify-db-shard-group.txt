OPTIONS
       --db-shard-group-identifier (string)
          The name of the DB shard group to modify.

       --max-acu (double)
          The  maximum capacity of the DB shard group in Aurora capacity units
          (ACUs).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       DBShardGroupResourceId -> (string)
          The  Amazon Web Services Region-unique, immutable identifier for the
          DB shard group.

       DBShardGroupIdentifier -> (string)
          The name of the DB shard group.

       DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
          The name of the primary DB cluster for the DB shard group.

       MaxACU -> (double)
          The maximum capacity of the DB shard group in Aurora capacity  units
          (ACUs).

       ComputeRedundancy -> (integer)
          Specifies  whether  to  create  standby  instances  for the DB shard
          group. Valid values are the following:

          o 0 - Creates a single, primary DB instance for each physical shard.
            This is the default value, and the only one supported for the pre-
            view.

          o 1 - Creates a primary DB instance and a standby instance in a dif-
            ferent Availability Zone (AZ) for each physical shard.

          o 2  -  Creates  a  primary DB instance and two standby instances in
            different AZs for each physical shard.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the DB shard group.

       PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether the DB shard group is publicly accessible.

          When the DB shard group is publicly accessible, its Domain Name Sys-
          tem  (DNS)  endpoint  resolves to the private IP address from within
          the DB shard group's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the
          public  IP  address from outside of the DB shard group's VPC. Access
          to the DB shard group is ultimately controlled by the security group
          it  uses.  That  public access isn't permitted if the security group
          assigned to the DB shard group doesn't permit it.

          When the DB shard group isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal
          DB  shard  group  with  a DNS name that resolves to a private IP ad-
          dress.

          This setting is only for Aurora Limitless Database.

       Endpoint -> (string)
          The connection endpoint for the DB shard group.
