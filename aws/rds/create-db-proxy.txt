OPTIONS
       --db-proxy-name (string)
          The identifier for the proxy. This name must be unique for all prox-
          ies owned by your Amazon Web Services account in the specified  Ama-
          zon  Web Services Region. An identifier must begin with a letter and
          must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens; it  can't  end
          with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

       --engine-family (string)
          The kinds of databases that the proxy can connect to. This value de-
          termines which database network protocol the proxy  recognizes  when
          it  interprets  network traffic to and from the database. For Aurora
          MySQL, RDS for MariaDB, and RDS for MySQL databases, specify MYSQL .
          For  Aurora  PostgreSQL  and  RDS  for PostgreSQL databases, specify
          POSTGRESQL . For RDS for Microsoft SQL Server, specify SQLSERVER .

          Possible values:

          o MYSQL

          o POSTGRESQL

          o SQLSERVER

          The authorization mechanism that the proxy uses.

          (structure)
              Specifies the details of authentication used by a proxy  to  log
              in as a specific database user.

              Description -> (string)
                 A user-specified description about the authentication used by
                 a proxy to log in as a specific database user.

              UserName -> (string)
                 The name of the database user to which the proxy connects.

                 tions from the proxy to the underlying database.

              SecretArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) representing the secret that
                 the proxy uses to authenticate to the RDS DB instance or  Au-
                 rora  DB  cluster. These secrets are stored within Amazon Se-
                 crets Manager.

              IAMAuth -> (string)
                 A value that indicates whether to require or disallow  Amazon
                 Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentica-
                 tion for connections to the proxy. The ENABLED value is valid
                 only for proxies with RDS for Microsoft SQL Server.

              ClientPasswordAuthType -> (string)
                 The  type  of  authentication  the proxy uses for connections
                 from clients.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Description=string,UserName=string,AuthScheme=string,SecretArn=string,IAMAuth=string,ClientPasswordAuthType=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Description": "string",
              "UserName": "string",
              "AuthScheme": "SECRETS",
              "SecretArn": "string",
              "IAMAuth": "DISABLED"|"REQUIRED"|"ENABLED",
              "ClientPasswordAuthType": "MYSQL_NATIVE_PASSWORD"|"POSTGRES_SCRAM_SHA_256"|"POSTGRES_MD5"|"SQL_SERVER_AUTHENTICATION"

       --require-tls | --no-require-tls (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is re-
          quired for connections to the proxy. By enabling this  setting,  you
          can enforce encrypted TLS connections to the proxy.

       --idle-client-timeout (integer)
          The number of seconds that a connection to the proxy can be inactive
          before the proxy disconnects it. You can set this  value  higher  or

          statements in its logs. This information helps you to  debug  issues
          involving  SQL  behavior  or  the performance and scalability of the
          proxy connections. The debug information includes the  text  of  SQL
          statements that you submit through the proxy. Thus, only enable this
          setting when needed for debugging, and only when you  have  security
          measures  in  place  to safeguard any sensitive information that ap-
          pears in the logs.

                 ':',    '/',    '=',    '+',    '-',    '@'    (Java   regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A value is the optional value of the tag.  The  string  value
                 can  be  from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length and can't

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
