NAME
       create-db-instance-read-replica -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new DB instance that acts as a read replica for an existing
       source DB instance or Multi-AZ  DB  cluster.  You  can  create  a  read
       replica  for  a  DB instance running Db2, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, Post-
       greSQL, or SQL Server. You can create a read replica for a Multi-AZ  DB
       cluster  running MySQL or PostgreSQL. For more information, see Working
       with read replicas and Migrating from a Multi-AZ DB cluster to a DB in-
       stance using a read replica in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

       Amazon  Aurora  doesn't support this operation. To create a DB instance
       for an Aurora DB cluster, use the CreateDBInstance operation.

       All read replica DB instances are created with  backups  disabled.  All
       other attributes (including DB security groups and DB parameter groups)
       are inherited from the source DB instance or cluster, except as  speci-
       fied.

       WARNING:
          Your  source  DB  instance or cluster must have backup retention en-
          abled.

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The DB instance identifier of the read replica. This  identifier  is
          the  unique  key  that  identifies  a DB instance. This parameter is
          stored as a lowercase string.

       --source-db-instance-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the DB instance that will act as  the  source  for
          the  read replica. Each DB instance can have up to 15 read replicas,
          with the exception of Oracle and SQL Server, which can  have  up  to
          five.

          Constraints:

          o Must be the identifier of an existing Db2, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle,
            PostgreSQL, or SQL Server DB instance.

          o Can't be specified if the SourceDBClusterIdentifier  parameter  is
            also specified.

          o For  the  limitations of Oracle read replicas, see Version and li-
            censing considerations for RDS for Oracle replicas in  the  Amazon
            RDS User Guide .

          o For  the limitations of SQL Server read replicas, see Read replica
            limitations with SQL Server in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          o The specified DB instance must  have  automatic  backups  enabled,
            that is, its backup retention period must be greater than 0.

          o If  the  source DB instance is in the same Amazon Web Services Re-
            gion as the read replica, specify a valid DB instance identifier.

          o If the source DB instance is in a different  Amazon  Web  Services
            Region from the read replica, specify a valid DB instance ARN. For
            more information, see Constructing an ARN for Amazon  RDS  in  the
            Amazon  RDS  User  Guide . This doesn't apply to SQL Server or RDS
            Custom, which don't support cross-Region replicas.

       --db-instance-class (string)
          The compute and memory capacity of the  read  replica,  for  example
          db.m4.large. Not all DB instance classes are available in all Amazon
          Web Services Regions, or for all database engines. For the full list
          of DB instance classes, and availability for your engine, see DB In-
          stance Class in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          Default: Inherits the value from the source DB instance.

       --availability-zone (string)
          The Availability Zone (AZ) where the read replica will be created.

          Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone in the endpoint's
          Amazon Web Services Region.

          Example: us-east-1d

       --port (integer)
          The port number that the DB instance uses for connections.

          Valid Values: 1150-65535

          Default: Inherits the value from the source DB instance.

       --multi-az | --no-multi-az (boolean)
          Specifies whether the read replica is in a Multi-AZ deployment.

          You can create a read replica as a Multi-AZ DB instance. RDS creates
          a standby of your replica in another Availability Zone for  failover
          support for the replica. Creating your read replica as a Multi-AZ DB
          instance is independent of whether the source is a Multi-AZ  DB  in-
          stance or a Multi-AZ DB cluster.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

       --auto-minor-version-upgrade  |  --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade (bool-
       ean)
          Specifies whether to automatically apply minor  engine  upgrades  to
          the read replica during the maintenance window.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

          Default: Inherits the value from the source DB instance.

       --iops (integer)
          The  amount of Provisioned IOPS (input/output operations per second)
          to initially allocate for the DB instance.

       --option-group-name (string)
          The option group to associate the DB instance with.  If  not  speci-
          fied,  RDS  uses  the option group associated with the source DB in-
          stance or cluster.

          NOTE:
              For SQL Server, you must use the option  group  associated  with
              the source.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

       --db-parameter-group-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  DB  parameter  group to associate with this read
          replica DB instance.

          For Single-AZ or Multi-AZ DB instance read replica instances, if you
          don't  specify  a  value  for DBParameterGroupName , then Amazon RDS
          uses the DBParameterGroup of the source DB instance for a  same  Re-
          gion read replica, or the default DBParameterGroup for the specified
          DB engine for a cross-Region read replica.

          For Multi-AZ DB cluster same Region read replica instances,  if  you
          don't  specify  a  value  for DBParameterGroupName , then Amazon RDS
          uses the default DBParameterGroup .

          Specifying a parameter group for this operation  is  only  supported
          for  MySQL DB instances for cross-Region read replicas, for Multi-AZ
          DB cluster read replica instances, and for Oracle DB  instances.  It
          isn't supported for MySQL DB instances for same Region read replicas
          or for RDS Custom.

          Constraints:

          o Must be 1 to 255 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

          When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain  Name  System
          (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB
          cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public  IP
          address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB clus-
          ter is ultimately controlled by the security  group  it  uses.  That
          public  access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the
          DB cluster doesn't permit it.

          When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
          instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

          For more information, see  CreateDBInstance .

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags.

          For more information, see Tagging Amazon RDS resources in the Amazon
          RDS User Guide or Tagging Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS resources  in
          the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

          (structure)
              Metadata  assigned  to  an  Amazon  RDS resource consisting of a
              key-value pair.

              For more information, see Tagging Amazon RDS  resources  in  the
              Amazon  RDS  User  Guide or Tagging Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS
              resources in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 A key is the required name of the tag. The string  value  can
                 be  from  1  to 128 Unicode characters in length and can't be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain only
                 the  set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.',
                 ':',   '/',    '=',    '+',    '-',    '@'    (Java    regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length  and  can't
                 be  prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain
                 only the set of Unicode letters,  digits,  white-space,  '_',
                 '.',   ':',   '/',   '=',   '+',   '-',   '@'   (Java  regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --db-subnet-group-name (string)
          A DB subnet group for the DB instance. The new DB instance  is  cre-
          ated in the VPC associated with the DB subnet group. If no DB subnet
          group is specified, then the new DB instance isn't created in a VPC.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match the name of an existing DB subnet group.

          o The specified DB subnet group must be in the same Amazon Web  Ser-
            vices Region in which the operation is running.

          o All  read replicas in one Amazon Web Services Region that are cre-
            ated from the same source DB instance must either:

            o Specify DB subnet groups from  the  same  VPC.  All  these  read
              replicas are created in the same VPC.

            o Not  specify a DB subnet group. All these read replicas are cre-
              ated outside of any VPC.

          Example: mydbsubnetgroup

       --vpc-security-group-ids (list)
          A list of Amazon EC2 VPC security groups to associate with the  read
          replica.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

          Default:  The  default  EC2  VPC  security  group  for the DB subnet
          group's VPC.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --storage-type (string)
          The storage type to associate with the read replica.

          If you specify io1 , io2 , or gp3 , you must also  include  a  value
          for the Iops parameter.

          Valid Values: gp2 | gp3 | io1 | io2 | standard

          Default: io1 if the Iops parameter is specified. Otherwise, gp2 .

       --copy-tags-to-snapshot | --no-copy-tags-to-snapshot (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  to  copy all tags from the read replica to snap-
          shots of the read replica. By default, tags aren't copied.

       --monitoring-interval (integer)
          The interval, in seconds, between points  when  Enhanced  Monitoring
          metrics are collected for the read replica. To disable collection of
          Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0 . The default is 0 .

          If MonitoringRoleArn is specified, then you must  set  MonitoringIn-
          terval to a value other than 0 .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

          Valid Values: 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60

          Default: 0

       --monitoring-role-arn (string)
          The  ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitor-
          ing   metrics   to   Amazon   CloudWatch    Logs.    For    example,
          arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess . For information on creating
          a monitoring role, go to To create an IAM role for  Amazon  RDS  En-
          hanced Monitoring in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          If  MonitoringInterval is set to a value other than 0, then you must
          supply a MonitoringRoleArn value.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier  for  an  encrypted  read
          replica.

          The  Amazon  Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID,
          alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

          If you create an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web  Ser-
          vices Region as the source DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster, don't
          specify a value for this parameter. A read replica in the same  Ama-
          zon Web Services Region is always encrypted with the same KMS key as
          the source DB instance or cluster.

          If you create an encrypted read replica in a  different  Amazon  Web
          Services  Region, then you must specify a KMS key identifier for the
          destination Amazon Web Services Region. KMS keys are specific to the
          Amazon  Web  Services Region that they are created in, and you can't
          use KMS keys from one Amazon Web Services Region in  another  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

          You  can't  create  an encrypted read replica from an unencrypted DB
          instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom, which uses  the  same  KMS
          key as the primary replica.

       --pre-signed-url (string)
          When  you  are  creating a read replica from one Amazon Web Services
          GovCloud (US) Region to another or from one China  Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices Region to another, the URL that contains a Signature Version 4
          signed request for the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica API operation  in
          the  source  Amazon  Web Services Region that contains the source DB
          instance.

          This setting applies only to Amazon Web Services GovCloud  (US)  Re-
          gions  and  China Amazon Web Services Regions. It's ignored in other
          Amazon Web Services Regions.

          This setting applies only when replicating from a source DB instance
          .  Source  DB  clusters aren't supported in Amazon Web Services Gov-
          Cloud (US) Regions and China Amazon Web Services Regions.

          You must specify this parameter when you create  an  encrypted  read
          replica  from another Amazon Web Services Region by using the Amazon
          RDS API. Don't specify PreSignedUrl when you  are  creating  an  en-
          crypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region.

          The  presigned  URL  must  be  a  valid  request for the CreateDBIn-
          stanceReadReplica API operation that can run in  the  source  Amazon
          Web  Services Region that contains the encrypted source DB instance.
          The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter  val-
          ues:

          o DestinationRegion  -  The  Amazon Web Services Region that the en-
            crypted read replica is created in. This Amazon Web  Services  Re-
            gion  is the same one where the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica opera-
            tion is called that contains this presigned URL. For  example,  if
            you  create  an  encrypted DB instance in the us-west-1 Amazon Web
            Services Region, from a source DB instance in the us-east-2 Amazon
            Web Services Region, then you call the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica
            operation in the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region and  provide
            a  presigned URL that contains a call to the CreateDBInstanceRead-
            Replica operation in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region. For
            this  example,  the DestinationRegion in the presigned URL must be
            set to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region.

          o KmsKeyId - The KMS key identifier for the key to  use  to  encrypt
            the  read  replica  in the destination Amazon Web Services Region.
            This is the same identifier  for  both  the  CreateDBInstanceRead-
            Replica  operation  that  is  called in the destination Amazon Web
            Services Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL.

          o SourceDBInstanceIdentifier - The DB instance  identifier  for  the
            encrypted DB instance to be replicated. This identifier must be in
            the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the  source  Amazon  Web
            Services  Region.  For  example,  if you are creating an encrypted
            read replica from a DB instance in the us-west-2 Amazon  Web  Ser-
            vices  Region, then your SourceDBInstanceIdentifier looks like the
            following     example:      arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:in-
            stance:mysql-instance1-20161115 .

          Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services
          Signature Version 4) and Signature Version 4 Signing Process .

          NOTE:
              If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you
              can specify SourceRegion (or --source-region for  the  CLI)  in-
              stead  of specifying PreSignedUrl manually. Specifying SourceRe-
              gion autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid  request  for
              the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Re-
              gion.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

       --enable-iam-database-authentication | --no-enable-iam-database-authen-
       tication (boolean)
          Specifies  whether to enable mapping of Amazon Web Services Identity
          and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database  accounts.  By  de-
          fault, mapping isn't enabled.

          For  more  information  about  IAM  database authentication, see IAM
          Database Authentication for MySQL and PostgreSQL in the  Amazon  RDS
          User Guide .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

          Specifies the mode of Database Insights.

          Possible values:

          o standard

          o advanced

       --enable-performance-insights | --no-enable-performance-insights (bool-
       ean)
          Specifies whether  to  enable  Performance  Insights  for  the  read
          replica.

          For  more  information, see Using Amazon Performance Insights in the
          Amazon RDS User Guide .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

       --performance-insights-kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Perfor-
          mance Insights data.

          The  Amazon  Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID,
          alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

          If you do not specify a value for PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId , then
          Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for
          your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web  Services  account
          has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

       --performance-insights-retention-period (integer)
          The number of days to retain Performance Insights data.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

          (structure)
              Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

              To  specify  the  number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature
              name for the Name parameter. To specify the  number  of  threads
              per  core,  use the threadsPerCore feature name for the Name pa-
              rameter.

              You can set the processor features of the DB instance class  for
              a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

              o CreateDBInstance

              o ModifyDBInstance

              o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

              o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

              o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

              You  can  view  the  valid processor values for a particular in-
              stance class by calling  the  DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions
              action and specifying the instance class for the DBInstanceClass
              parameter.

              In addition, you can use the following actions for  DB  instance
              class processor information:

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribeDBSnapshots

              o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

              If  you  call  DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  returns
              non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

              o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

              o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the  number
                of CPU cores and threads per core.

              o The  current  number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-de-
                fault value.

              For more information, see Configuring the processor for a DB in-
              stance class in RDS for Oracle in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the processor feature. Valid names are coreCount
                 and threadsPerCore .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of a processor feature.

          see Deleting a DB Instance .

       --domain (string)
          The Active Directory directory ID to create the DB instance in. Cur-
          rently, only MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL  DB
          instances can be created in an Active Directory Domain.

          For  more information, see Kerberos Authentication in the Amazon RDS
          User Guide .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

       --domain-iam-role-name (string)
          The name of the IAM role to use when making API calls to the  Direc-
          tory Service.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

       --domain-fqdn (string)
          The  fully  qualified  domain name (FQDN) of an Active Directory do-
          main.

          Constraints:

          o Can't be longer than 64 characters.

       --replica-mode (string)
          The open mode of the replica database: mounted or read-only.

          NOTE:
              This parameter is only supported for Oracle DB instances.

          Mounted  DB replicas are included in Oracle Database Enterprise Edi-
          tion. The main use case for mounted replicas is cross-Region  disas-
          ter  recovery. The primary database doesn't use Active Data Guard to
          transmit information to the mounted replica. Because it doesn't  ac-
          cept  user  connections,  a  mounted replica can't serve a read-only
          workload.

          You can create a combination of mounted and  read-only  DB  replicas
          for  the same primary DB instance. For more information, see Working
          with Oracle Read Replicas for Amazon RDS  in  the  Amazon  RDS  User
          Guide .

          For  RDS  Custom,  you  must  specify  this  parameter and set it to
          mounted . The value won't be set by default. After replica creation,
          you can manage the open mode manually.

          Possible values:

          o open-read-only

          o mounted

       --max-allocated-storage (integer)
          The upper limit in gibibytes (GiB) to which Amazon RDS can automati-
          cally scale the storage of the DB instance.

          For more information about this setting, including limitations  that
          apply  to  it,  see  Managing capacity automatically with Amazon RDS
          storage autoscaling in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

       --custom-iam-instance-profile (string)
          The instance profile associated with the underlying Amazon  EC2  in-
          stance  of an RDS Custom DB instance. The instance profile must meet
          the following requirements:

          o The profile must exist in your account.

          o The profile must have an IAM role that Amazon EC2 has  permissions
            to assume.

          o The  instance  profile  name and the associated IAM role name must
            start with the prefix AWSRDSCustom .

          For the list of permissions required for the IAM role, see Configure
          IAM and your VPC in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          This setting is required for RDS Custom DB instances.

       --network-type (string)
          The network type of the DB instance.

          Valid Values:

          o IPV4

          o DUAL

          The  network  type  is determined by the DBSubnetGroup specified for
          read replica. A DBSubnetGroup can support only the IPv4 protocol  or
          the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (DUAL ).

          For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in the
          Amazon RDS User Guide.

       --storage-throughput (integer)
          Specifies the storage throughput value for the read replica.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom or  Amazon  Aurora  DB  in-
          stances.

       --enable-customer-owned-ip | --no-enable-customer-owned-ip (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  to enable a customer-owned IP address (CoIP) for
          an RDS on Outposts read replica.

          A CoIP provides local or external connectivity to resources in  your
          Outpost  subnets  through  your  on-premises  network.  For some use
          cases, a CoIP can provide lower latency for connections to the  read
          replica  from outside of its virtual private cloud (VPC) on your lo-
          cal network.

          For more information about RDS on Outposts, see Working with  Amazon
          RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          For more information about CoIPs, see Customer-owned IP addresses in
          the Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide .

       --allocated-storage (integer)
          The amount of storage (in gibibytes) to allocate initially  for  the
          read  replica.  Follow the allocation rules specified in CreateDBIn-
          stance .

          NOTE:
              Be sure to allocate enough storage for your read replica so that
              the  create  operation  can succeed. You can also allocate addi-
              tional storage for future growth.

       --source-db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the Multi-AZ DB  cluster  that  will  act  as  the
          source  for the read replica. Each DB cluster can have up to 15 read
          replicas.

          Constraints:

          o Must be the identifier of an existing Multi-AZ DB cluster.

          o Can't be specified if the SourceDBInstanceIdentifier parameter  is
            also specified.

          o The specified DB cluster must have automatic backups enabled, that
            is, its backup retention period must be greater than 0.

          o The source DB cluster must be in the same Amazon Web Services  Re-
            gion  as  the  read  replica.  Cross-Region replication isn't sup-
            ported.

       --dedicated-log-volume | --no-dedicated-log-volume (boolean)
          Indicates whether the DB instance has a dedicated log  volume  (DLV)

       --upgrade-storage-config | --no-upgrade-storage-config (boolean)
          Whether to upgrade the storage file system configuration on the read
          replica. This option migrates the read replica from the old  storage
          file system layout to the preferred layout.

       --ca-certificate-identifier (string)
          The  CA  certificate identifier to use for the read replica's server
          certificate.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

          For more information, see Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a
          DB  instance  in  the Amazon RDS User Guide and Using SSL/TLS to en-
          crypt a connection to a DB cluster in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

       --source-region (string)
          The ID of the region that contains the source for the read replica.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

              Domain  Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the public IP ad-
              dress. When you connect from within the same VPC as the  DB  in-
              stance,  the endpoint resolves to the private IP address. Access
              to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group
              it  uses.  That  public  access  isn't permitted if the security
              group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

              When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an  inter-
              nal  DB  instance  with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP
              address.

                 Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

                 To specify the number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature
                 name for the Name parameter. To specify the number of threads
                 per core, use the threadsPerCore feature name  for  the  Name
                 parameter.

                 You  can  set the processor features of the DB instance class
                 for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

                 o CreateDBInstance

                 o ModifyDBInstance

                 o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                 o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

                 You can view the valid processor values for a particular  in-
                 stance  class  by  calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOp-
                 tions action and specifying the instance class for the  DBIn-
                 stanceClass parameter.

                 In  addition,  you  can  use the following actions for DB in-
                 stance class processor information:

                 o DescribeDBSnapshots

                 o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                 If you call DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  returns
                 non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

                 o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                 o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the num-
                   ber of CPU cores and threads per core.

                 o The current number CPU  cores  and  threads  is  set  to  a
                   non-default value.

              stance  recovery. If all paused , the instance pauses automation
              for the duration set by --resume-full-automation-mode-minutes .

          ResumeFullAutomationModeTime -> (timestamp)
              The number of minutes to pause the automation. When the time pe-
              riod ends, RDS Custom resumes full automation. The minimum value
              is 60 (default). The maximum value is 1,440.

          CustomIamInstanceProfile -> (string)
              The instance profile associated with the underlying  Amazon  EC2
              instance of an RDS Custom DB instance. The instance profile must
              meet the following requirements:

              o The profile must exist in your account.

              o The profile must have an IAM role that Amazon EC2 has  permis-
                sions to assume.

              o The  instance  profile  name  and the associated IAM role name
                must start with the prefix AWSRDSCustom .

              For the list of permissions  required  for  the  IAM  role,  see

              Region.

          NetworkType -> (string)
              The network type of the DB instance.

              The  network  type  is determined by the DBSubnetGroup specified
              for the DB instance. A DBSubnetGroup can support only  the  IPv4
              protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (DUAL ).

              For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in
              the Amazon RDS User Guide and Working with a DB  instance  in  a
              VPC in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

              Valid Values: IPV4 | DUAL

          ActivityStreamPolicyStatus -> (string)
              The status of the policy state of the activity stream.

          StorageThroughput -> (integer)
              The storage throughput for the DB instance.

              This setting applies only to the gp3 storage type.

          DBSystemId -> (string)
              The  Oracle  system  ID  (Oracle  SID)  for a container database
              (CDB). The Oracle SID is also the name of the CDB. This  setting
              is only valid for RDS Custom DB instances.

          MasterUserSecret -> (structure)
              The secret managed by RDS in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager
              for the master user password.

              For more information, see Password management  with  Amazon  Web
              Services Secrets Manager in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

              SecretArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret.

              SecretStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the secret.

                 The possible status values include the following:

                 o creating - The secret is being created.

                 o active  -  The secret is available for normal use and rota-
                   tion.

                 o rotating - The secret is being rotated.

                 o impaired - The secret can be used to access  database  cre-
                   dentials, but it can't be rotated. A secret might have this
                   status if, for example, permissions are changed so that RDS
                   can  no  longer access either the secret or the KMS key for
                   the secret. When a secret has this status, you can  correct
                   the condition that caused the status. Alternatively, modify
                   the DB instance to turn off automatic management  of  data-
                   base  credentials, and then modify the DB instance again to
                   turn on automatic management of database credentials.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier that  is  used  to
                 encrypt the secret.

              The details of the DB instance's server certificate.

              CAIdentifier -> (string)
                 The  CA  identifier of the CA certificate used for the DB in-
                 stance's server certificate.

              ValidTill -> (timestamp)
                 The expiration date of the DB instances server certificate.

          ReadReplicaSourceDBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              The identifier of the source DB cluster if this DB instance is a
              read replica.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              The progress of the storage optimization operation as a percent-
              age.

          DedicatedLogVolume -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the DB instance has  a  dedicated  log  volume
              (DLV) enabled.

          IsStorageConfigUpgradeAvailable -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether an upgrade is recommended for the storage file
              system configuration on the DB instance. To migrate to the  pre-
              ferred configuration, you can either create a blue/green deploy-
              ment, or create a read replica from the DB  instance.  For  more
              information,  see Upgrading the storage file system for a DB in-
              stance .

          MultiTenant -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the DB instance is in the multi-tenant config-
              uration (TRUE) or the single-tenant configuration (FALSE).
