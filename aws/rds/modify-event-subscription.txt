MODIFY-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTION()                        MODIFY-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTION()



NAME
       modify-event-subscription -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  an  existing  RDS  event notification subscription. You can't
       modify the source identifiers using this call. To change source identi-
       fiers for a subscription, use the AddSourceIdentifierToSubscription and
       RemoveSourceIdentifierFromSubscription calls.

       You can see a list of the event categories  for  a  given  source  type
       (SourceType  )  in  Events in the Amazon RDS User Guide or by using the
       DescribeEventCategories operation.

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The name of the RDS event notification subscription.

       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SNS topic  created  for  event
          notification.  The  ARN  is  created by Amazon SNS when you create a
          topic and subscribe to it.

       --source-type (string)
          The type of source that is generating the events.  For  example,  if
          you  want  to  be notified of events generated by a DB instance, you
          would set this parameter to db-instance. For RDS Proxy events, spec-
          ify  db-proxy  .  If  this value isn't specified, all events are re-
          turned.

          Valid values: db-instance | db-cluster | db-parameter-group | db-se-
          curity-group | db-snapshot | db-cluster-snapshot | db-proxy

       --event-categories (list)
          A  list of event categories for a source type (SourceType ) that you
          want to subscribe to. You can see a list of  the  categories  for  a
          given source type in Events in the Amazon RDS User Guide or by using
          the DescribeEventCategories operation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to activate the subscription.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To modify an event subscription

       The following modify-event-subscription example disables the  specified
       event subscription, so that it no longer publishes notifications to the

          aws rds modify-event-subscription \
              --subscription-name my-instance-events \
              --no-enabled

                      "backup",
                      "recovery"
                  ],
