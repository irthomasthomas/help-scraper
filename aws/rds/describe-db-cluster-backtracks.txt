DESCRIBE-DB-CLUSTER-BACKTRACKS()              DESCRIBE-DB-CLUSTER-BACKTRACKS()



NAME
       describe-db-cluster-backtracks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about backtracks for a DB cluster.

       For  more  information  on Amazon Aurora, see What is Amazon Aurora? in
       the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

       NOTE:
          This action only applies to Aurora MySQL DB clusters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-db-cluster-backtracks is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: DBClusterBacktracks

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  DB  cluster  identifier of the DB cluster to be described. This
          parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Example: my-cluster1

       --backtrack-identifier (string)
          If specified, this value is the backtrack identifier  of  the  back-
          track to be described.

          Constraints:

          o Must  contain  a  valid  universally unique identifier (UUID). For
            more information about UUIDs, see A Universally Unique  Identifier
            (UUID) URN Namespace .

          Example: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000

       --filters (list)
          A  filter  that  specifies one or more DB clusters to describe. Sup-
          ported filters include the following:

          o db-cluster-backtrack-id - Accepts backtrack identifiers.  The  re-
            sults  list includes information about only the backtracks identi-
            fied by these identifiers.

          o db-cluster-backtrack-status - Accepts any of the  following  back-
            track status values:

            o applying

            o completed

            o failed

            o pending

          The  results  list  includes  information  about only the backtracks
          identified by these values.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The  following describe-db-cluster-backtracks example retrieves details
       about the specified DB cluster.

                 o applying - The backtrack is currently being applied  to  or
                   rolled back from the DB cluster.

                 o completed  - The backtrack has successfully been applied to
                   or rolled back from the DB cluster.

                 o failed - An error occurred while the backtrack was  applied
                   to or rolled back from the DB cluster.
