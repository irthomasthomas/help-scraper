DELETE-DB-CLUSTER()                                        DELETE-DB-CLUSTER()



NAME
       delete-db-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       The DeleteDBCluster action deletes a previously provisioned DB cluster.
       When you delete a DB cluster, all automated backups for that DB cluster
       are  deleted and can't be recovered. Manual DB cluster snapshots of the
       specified DB cluster are not deleted.

       If you're deleting a Multi-AZ DB cluster with read replicas, all  clus-
       ter members are terminated and read replicas are promoted to standalone
       instances.

       For more information on Amazon Aurora, see What is  Amazon  Aurora?  in
       the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

       For  more  information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see Multi-AZ DB cluster
       deployments in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The DB cluster identifier for the DB cluster to be deleted. This pa-
          rameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must match an existing DBClusterIdentifier.

       --skip-final-snapshot | --no-skip-final-snapshot (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  to skip the creation of a final DB cluster snap-
          shot before the DB cluster is deleted. If skip is specified,  no  DB
          cluster  snapshot  is created. If skip isn't specified, a DB cluster
          snapshot is created before the DB cluster is  deleted.  By  default,
          skip isn't specified, and the DB cluster snapshot is created. By de-
          fault, this parameter is disabled.

          NOTE:
              You must specify a FinalDBSnapshotIdentifier parameter if  Skip-
              FinalSnapshot is disabled.

       --final-db-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The  DB  cluster  snapshot identifier of the new DB cluster snapshot
          created when SkipFinalSnapshot is disabled.

          NOTE:
              Specifying this parameter and also skipping the  creation  of  a
              final  DB  cluster snapshot with the SkipFinalShapshot parameter
              results in an error.

          Constraints:

          o Must be 1 to 255 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

       --delete-automated-backups | --no-delete-automated-backups (boolean)
          Specifies whether to remove automated backups immediately after  the
          DB  cluster is deleted. This parameter isn't case-sensitive. The de-
          fault is to remove automated backups immediately after the DB  clus-
          ter is deleted.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To delete a DB instance in a DB cluster

       The  following delete-db-instance example deletes the final DB instance
       in a DB cluster. You can't delete a DB cluster if it  contains  DB  in-
       stances that aren't in the deleting state. You can't take a final snap-
       shot when deleting a DB instance in a DB cluster.

          aws rds delete-db-instance \
              --db-instance-identifier database-3

       Output:

          {
              "DBInstance": {
                  "DBInstanceIdentifier": "database-3",
                  "DBInstanceClass": "db.r4.large",
                  "Engine": "aurora-postgresql",
                  "DBInstanceStatus": "deleting",

              ...output omitted...

              }
          }

       For more information, see Deleting a DB Instance in an Aurora DB  Clus-
       ter in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

       Example 2: To delete a DB cluster

       The  following  delete-db-cluster  example deletes the DB cluster named
       mycluster and takes a final  snapshot  named  mycluster-final-snapshot.
       The  status  of the DB cluster is available while the snapshot is being
       taken.  To  follow  the  progress  of  the  deletion,   use   the   de-
       scribe-db-clusters CLI command.

          aws rds delete-db-cluster \
              --db-cluster-identifier mycluster \
              --no-skip-final-snapshot \
              --final-db-snapshot-identifier mycluster-final-snapshot

       Output:

          {
              "DBCluster": {
                  "AllocatedStorage": 20,
                  "AvailabilityZones": [
                      "eu-central-1b",
                      "eu-central-1c",
                      "eu-central-1a"
                  ],
                  "BackupRetentionPeriod": 7,
                  "DBClusterIdentifier": "mycluster",
                  "DBClusterParameterGroup": "default.aurora-postgresql10",
                  "DBSubnetGroup": "default-vpc-aa11bb22",
                  "Status": "available",

              ...output omitted...

              }
          }

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Contains the details of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster or  Multi-AZ  DB
          cluster.

          For  an  Amazon  Aurora  DB cluster, this data type is used as a re-
          sponse element in the operations CreateDBCluster , DeleteDBCluster ,
          DescribeDBClusters  ,  FailoverDBCluster  ,  ModifyDBCluster  , Pro-
          moteReadReplicaDBCluster , RestoreDBClusterFromS3  ,  RestoreDBClus-
          terFromSnapshot  ,  RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime , StartDBCluster ,
          and StopDBCluster .

          For a Multi-AZ DB cluster, this data type is used as a response ele-
          ment  in  the  operations  CreateDBCluster  ,  DeleteDBCluster , De-
          scribeDBClusters , FailoverDBCluster , ModifyDBCluster  ,  RebootDB-
          Cluster  ,  RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot  ,  and RestoreDBClusterTo-
          PointInTime .

          For more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see What is  Ama-
          zon Aurora? in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

          For  more  information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see Multi-AZ deploy-
          ments with two readable standby DB instances in the Amazon RDS  User
          Guide.

          AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
              For  all database engines except Amazon Aurora, AllocatedStorage
              specifies the allocated storage size in gibibytes (GiB). For Au-
              rora, AllocatedStorage always returns 1, because Aurora DB clus-
              ter storage size isn't fixed, but instead automatically  adjusts
              as needed.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              The  list  of Availability Zones (AZs) where instances in the DB
              cluster can be created.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              The number of days for which  automatic  DB  snapshots  are  re-
              tained.

          CharacterSetName -> (string)
              If  present,  specifies  the name of the character set that this
              cluster is associated with.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              The name of the initial database that was specified for  the  DB
              cluster when it was created, if one was provided. This same name
              is returned for the life of the DB cluster.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              The user-supplied identifier for the DB cluster. This identifier
              is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              The name of the DB cluster parameter group for the DB cluster.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Information  about the subnet group associated with the DB clus-
              ter, including the name, description, and subnets in the  subnet
              group.

          Status -> (string)
              The current state of this DB cluster.

          AutomaticRestartTime -> (timestamp)
              The time when a stopped DB cluster is restarted automatically.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              The progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The  earliest  time  to  which  a  database can be restored with
              point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              The connection endpoint for the primary instance of the DB clus-
              ter.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The  reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint for
              a DB cluster load-balances connections across the Aurora  Repli-
              cas  that  are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new
              connections to the reader endpoint, Aurora distributes the  con-
              nection  requests  among  the Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster.
              This functionality can help balance your  read  workload  across
              multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster.

              If  a  failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica that you are con-
              nected to is promoted to be the primary instance,  your  connec-
              tion is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other
              Aurora Replicas in the cluster, you can then  reconnect  to  the
              reader endpoint.

          LatestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The latest time  to  which  a  database  can  be  restored  with
              point-in-time restore.

          Port -> (integer)
              The port that the database engine is listening on.

                     Indicates whether the cluster member is  the  primary  DB
                     instance for the DB cluster.

                 DBClusterParameterGroupStatus -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  status  of the DB cluster parameter group
                     for this member of the DB cluster.

                 PromotionTier -> (integer)
                     A value that specifies  the  order  in  which  an  Aurora
                     Replica is promoted to the primary instance after a fail-
                     ure of the existing primary instance. For  more  informa-
                     tion, see Fault Tolerance for an Aurora DB Cluster in the

              identifier for the encrypted DB cluster.

              The  Amazon  Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key
              ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

          DbClusterResourceId -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services Region-unique, immutable identifier  for

                 Status -> (string)
                     Describes the state of association between the  IAM  role
                     and  the  DB  cluster. The Status property returns one of
                     the following values:

                     o ACTIVE - the IAM role ARN is  associated  with  the  DB
                       cluster and can be used to access other Amazon Web Ser-
                       vices on your behalf.

          PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the DB cluster is publicly accessible.

              When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name Sys-
              tem  (DNS)  endpoint  resolves  to  the  private IP address from
              within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves
              to  the  public IP address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC.
              Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by  the  secu-
              rity  group  it  uses. That public access isn't permitted if the
              security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

              When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal
              DB  cluster  with  a  DNS name that resolves to a private IP ad-
              dress.

                   dentials, but it can't be rotated. A secret might have this
                   status if, for example, permissions are changed so that RDS
                   can  no  longer access either the secret or the KMS key for
                   the secret. When a secret has this status, you can  correct
                   the condition that caused the status. Alternatively, modify
                   the DB instance to turn off automatic management  of  data-
                   base  credentials, and then modify the DB instance again to
                   turn on automatic management of database credentials.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier that  is  used  to
                 encrypt the secret.

          IOOptimizedNextAllowedModificationTime -> (timestamp)
              The  next  time  you  can  modify  the DB cluster to use the au-
              rora-iopt1 storage type.

              This setting is only for Aurora DB clusters.

          LocalWriteForwardingStatus -> (string)
              Indicates whether an Aurora DB cluster has in-cluster write for-
              warding enabled, not enabled, requested, or is in the process of
              enabling it.

          AwsBackupRecoveryPointArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recovery point  in  Amazon
              Web Services Backup.
