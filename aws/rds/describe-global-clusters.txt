NAME
       describe-global-clusters -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  Aurora  global database clusters. This API
       supports pagination.

       For more information on Amazon Aurora, see What is  Amazon  Aurora?  in
       the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

       NOTE:
          This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-global-clusters  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: GlobalClusters

OPTIONS
       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The user-supplied DB cluster identifier. If this parameter is speci-
          fied,  information  from  only  the specific DB cluster is returned.
          This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match an existing DBClusterIdentifier.

       --filters (list)
          This parameter isn't currently supported.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 of  an  in-process  or pending switchover or failover process
                 for this global cluster (Aurora global database). This object
                 is  empty unless the SwitchoverGlobalCluster or FailoverGlob-
                 alCluster operation was called on this global cluster.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The current status of the global cluster. Possible values
                     are as follows:

                     o pending   The service received a request to switch over
                       or fail over the global cluster. The  global  cluster's
                       primary DB cluster and the specified secondary DB clus-
                       ter are being verified before the operation starts.

                     o failing-over  This status covers the  range  of  Aurora
                       internal   operations   that   take  place  during  the
                       switchover or failover process, such  as  demoting  the
                       primary  Aurora DB cluster, promoting the secondary Au-
                       rora DB cluster, and synchronizing replicas.

                     o cancelling  The request to switch over or fail over the
                       global  cluster was cancelled and the primary Aurora DB
                       cluster and the selected secondary  Aurora  DB  cluster
                       are returning to their previous states.

                 FromDbClusterArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Aurora DB cluster
                     that is currently being demoted, and which is  associated
                     with this state.

                 ToDbClusterArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Aurora DB cluster
                     that is currently being promoted, and which is associated
                     with this state.

                 IsDataLossAllowed -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether the operation is a global switchover or
                     a global failover. If data loss is allowed, then the  op-
                     eration   is   a   global  failover.  Otherwise,  it's  a
                     switchover.
