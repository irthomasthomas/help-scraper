DESCRIBE-DB-PROXY-ENDPOINTS()                    DESCRIBE-DB-PROXY-ENDPOINTS()



NAME
       describe-db-proxy-endpoints -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about DB proxy endpoints.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-db-proxy-endpoints  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: DBProxyEndpoints

OPTIONS
       --db-proxy-name (string)
          The name of the DB proxy whose endpoints you want  to  describe.  If
          you  omit  this parameter, the output includes information about all
          DB proxy endpoints associated with all your DB proxies.

       --db-proxy-endpoint-name (string)
          The name of a DB proxy endpoint to describe. If you omit this param-
          eter,  the  output includes information about all DB proxy endpoints
          associated with the specified proxy.

       --filters (list)
          This parameter is not currently supported.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribeDBRecommendations

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       DBProxyEndpoints -> (list)
          The list of ProxyEndpoint objects returned by the API operation.

          (structure)
              The data structure representing an endpoint associated with a DB
              proxy. RDS automatically creates one endpoint for each DB proxy.
              For Aurora DB clusters, you can associate  additional  endpoints
              with  the  same  DB  proxy. These endpoints can be read/write or
              read-only. They can also reside in different VPCs than the asso-
              ciated DB proxy.

              This  data  type  is  used  as  a  response  element  in the De-
              scribeDBProxyEndpoints operation.

              DBProxyEndpointName -> (string)
                 The name for the DB proxy endpoint. An identifier must  begin
                 with  a  letter  and must contain only ASCII letters, digits,
                 and hyphens; it can't end with a hyphen or contain  two  con-
                 secutive hyphens.

              DBProxyEndpointArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the DB proxy endpoint.

              DBProxyName -> (string)
                 The  identifier for the DB proxy that is associated with this
                 DB proxy endpoint.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of this DB proxy  endpoint.  A  status  of
                 available  means  the  endpoint  is ready to handle requests.
                 Other values indicate that you must wait for the endpoint  to
                 be ready, or take some action to resolve an issue.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 Provides the VPC ID of the DB proxy endpoint.

              VpcSecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                 Provides a list of VPC security groups that the DB proxy end-
                 point belongs to.

                 (string)

              VpcSubnetIds -> (list)
                 The EC2 subnet IDs for the DB proxy endpoint.

                 (string)

              Endpoint -> (string)
                 The endpoint that you can use to connect to the DB proxy. You
                 include  the  endpoint  value  in the connection string for a
                 database client application.

              CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the DB proxy endpoint was  first  cre-
                 ated.

              TargetRole -> (string)
                 A  value  that indicates whether the DB proxy endpoint can be
                 used for read/write or read-only operations.

              IsDefault -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether this endpoint is the default  endpoint  for
                 the  associated  DB  proxy. Default DB proxy endpoints always
                 have read/write capability. Other endpoints  that  you  asso-
                 ciate   with  the  DB  proxy  can  be  either  read/write  or
                 read-only.

       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter  is  specified,  the response includes only records beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .
