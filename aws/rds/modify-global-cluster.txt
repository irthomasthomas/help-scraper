NAME
       modify-global-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  a  setting  for an Amazon Aurora global database cluster. You
       can change one or more database configuration parameters by  specifying
       these  parameters  and the new values in the request. For more informa-
       tion on Amazon Aurora, see What is Amazon Aurora? in the Amazon  Aurora
       User Guide .

       NOTE:
          This operation only applies to Aurora global database clusters.

OPTIONS
       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The cluster identifier for the global cluster to modify. This param-
          eter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing global database cluster.

       --new-global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The new cluster identifier for the  global  database  cluster.  This
          value is stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o The first character must be a letter.

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Example: my-cluster2

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          Specifies whether to enable deletion protection for the global data-
          base cluster. The global database  cluster  can't  be  deleted  when
          deletion protection is enabled.

       --engine-version (string)
          The  version  number of the database engine to which you want to up-
          grade.

          To list all of the available engine versions for  aurora-mysql  (for
          MySQL-based Aurora global databases), use the following command:
              aws   rds   describe-db-engine-versions   --engine  aurora-mysql
              --query  '*[]|[?SupportsGlobalDatabases  ==  `true`].[EngineVer-
              sion]'

          To  list  all of the available engine versions for aurora-postgresql
          (for PostgreSQL-based Aurora global databases),  use  the  following
          command:
              aws  rds  describe-db-engine-versions --engine aurora-postgresql
              --query  '*[]|[?SupportsGlobalDatabases  ==  `true`].[EngineVer-
              sion]'

       --allow-major-version-upgrade | --no-allow-major-version-upgrade (bool-
       ean)
          Specifies whether to allow major version upgrades.

          Constraints: Must be enabled if you specify a value for the EngineV-
          ersion  parameter  that's  a different major version than the global
          cluster's current version.

          If you upgrade the major version of a global database,  the  cluster
          and  DB  instance  parameter groups are set to the default parameter
          groups for the new version. Apply any custom parameter groups  after
          completing the upgrade.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To modify a global DB cluster

       The following modify-global-cluster example enables deletion protection
       for an Aurora MySQL-compatible global DB cluster.

          aws rds modify-global-cluster \
              --global-cluster-identifier myglobalcluster \
              --deletion-protection

              unless  the SwitchoverGlobalCluster or FailoverGlobalCluster op-
              eration was called on this global cluster.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of the global cluster. Possible values are
                 as follows:

                 o pending   The  service received a request to switch over or
                   fail over the global cluster. The global cluster's  primary
                   DB cluster and the specified secondary DB cluster are being
                   verified before the operation starts.

                 o failing-over  This status covers the range of Aurora inter-
                   nal  operations  that  take  place during the switchover or
                   failover process, such as demoting the  primary  Aurora  DB
                   cluster,  promoting  the  secondary  Aurora DB cluster, and
                   synchronizing replicas.

                 o cancelling  The request to switch over  or  fail  over  the
                   global  cluster  was  cancelled  and  the primary Aurora DB
                   cluster and the selected secondary Aurora  DB  cluster  are
                   returning to their previous states.

              FromDbClusterArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Aurora DB cluster that
                 is currently being demoted, and which is associated with this
                 state.

              ToDbClusterArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Aurora DB cluster that
                 is currently being promoted, and  which  is  associated  with
                 this state.

              IsDataLossAllowed -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  the operation is a global switchover or a
                 global failover. If data loss is allowed, then the  operation
                 is a global failover. Otherwise, it's a switchover.
