OPTIONS
       --resource-identifier (string)
          The RDS Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource that the  pending
          maintenance  action  applies  to.  For information about creating an
          ARN, see Constructing an RDS Amazon Resource Name (ARN) .

       --apply-action (string)
          The pending maintenance action to apply to this resource.

          Valid Values:

          o ca-certificate-rotation

          o db-upgrade

          o hardware-maintenance

          o os-upgrade

          o system-update

          For more information about these actions,  see  Maintenance  actions
          for Amazon Aurora or Maintenance actions for Amazon RDS .

       --opt-in-type (string)
          A  value  that  specifies  the  type of opt-in request, or undoes an
          opt-in request. An opt-in request of type immediate can't be undone.

          Valid Values:

          o immediate - Apply the maintenance action immediately.

          o next-maintenance - Apply the maintenance action  during  the  next
            maintenance window for the resource.

          o undo-opt-in  -  Cancel  any  existing  next-maintenance opt-in re-
            quests.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To apply pending maintenance actions

       The  following  apply-pending-maintenance-action  example  applies  the
       pending maintenance actions for a DB cluster.

          aws rds apply-pending-maintenance-action \
              --resource-identifier arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster:my-db-cluster \
              --apply-action system-update \
              --opt-in-type immediate

       Output:

          {
              "ResourcePendingMaintenanceActions": {
                  "ResourceIdentifier": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster:my-db-cluster",
                  "PendingMaintenanceActionDetails": [
                      {
                          "Action": "system-update",
                          "OptInStatus": "immediate",
                          "CurrentApplyDate": "2021-01-23T01:07:36.100Z",
                          "Description": "Upgrade to Aurora PostgreSQL 3.3.2"
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }

                     actions for Amazon Aurora or Maintenance actions for Ama-
                     zon RDS .

                 AutoAppliedAfterDate -> (timestamp)
                     The date of the maintenance window when the action is ap-
                     plied.  The maintenance action is applied to the resource

                     resource as soon as possible, regardless of  the  mainte-
                     nance  window for the resource. There might be a delay of

                     ceived for the resource.

                 CurrentApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                     The effective date when the pending maintenance action is

                     nanceAction  API,  the  AutoAppliedAfterDate  ,  and  the
                     ForcedApplyDate . This value is blank if  an  opt-in  re-
                     quest  has  not been received and nothing has been speci-
                     fied as AutoAppliedAfterDate or ForcedApplyDate .
