DELETE-CUSTOM-DB-ENGINE-VERSION()            DELETE-CUSTOM-DB-ENGINE-VERSION()



NAME
       delete-custom-db-engine-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  custom  engine  version. To run this command, make sure you
       meet the following prerequisites:

       o The CEV must not be the default for RDS Custom. If it is, change  the
         default before running this command.

       o The  CEV  must  not be associated with an RDS Custom DB instance, RDS
         Custom instance snapshot, or automated backup of your RDS Custom  in-
         stance.

       Typically, deletion takes a few minutes.

       NOTE:
          The  MediaImport service that imports files from Amazon S3 to create
          CEVs isn't integrated with Amazon Web Services  CloudTrail.  If  you
          turn  on  data  logging  for  Amazon RDS in CloudTrail, calls to the
          DeleteCustomDbEngineVersion event aren't logged. However, you  might
          see  calls from the API gateway that accesses your Amazon S3 bucket.
          These calls originate from the MediaImport service for  the  Delete-
          CustomDbEngineVersion event.

       For more information, see Deleting a CEV in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --engine (string)
          The database engine. The only supported engine is custom-oracle-ee .

       --engine-version (string)
          The custom engine version (CEV) for your DB instance. This option is
          required for RDS Custom, but optional for Amazon RDS.  The  combina-
          tion  of  Engine and EngineVersion is unique per customer per Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
