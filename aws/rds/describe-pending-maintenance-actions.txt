DESCRIBE-PENDING-MAINTENANCE-ACTIONS()  DESCRIBE-PENDING-MAINTENANCE-ACTIONS()



NAME
       describe-pending-maintenance-actions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of resources (for example, DB instances) that have at
       least one pending maintenance action.

       This API follows an eventual consistency model. This means that the re-
       sult  of the DescribePendingMaintenanceActions command might not be im-
       mediately visible to all subsequent RDS commands.  Keep  this  in  mind
       when  you use DescribePendingMaintenanceActions immediately after using
       a previous API command such as ApplyPendingMaintenanceActions .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-pending-maintenance-actions is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: PendingMaintenanceActions

OPTIONS
       --resource-identifier (string)
          The ARN of a resource to return pending maintenance actions for.

       --filters (list)
          A  filter  that  specifies  one  or more resources to return pending
          maintenance actions for.

          Supported filters:

          o db-cluster-id - Accepts DB cluster identifiers and DB cluster Ama-
            zon  Resource Names (ARNs). The results list only includes pending
            maintenance actions for the DB clusters identified by these ARNs.

          o db-instance-id - Accepts DB instance identifiers and  DB  instance
            ARNs.  The  results list only includes pending maintenance actions
            for the DB instances identified by these ARNs.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribeDBRecommendations

              o DescribeDBShardGroups

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                     AutoAppliedAfterDate -> (timestamp)
                        The  date of the maintenance window when the action is
                        applied. The maintenance action is applied to the  re-
                        source  during its first maintenance window after this
                        date.

                        applied.

                        On this date, the maintenance action is applied to the
                        resource as soon as possible, regardless of the  main-
                        tenance  window for the resource. There might be a de-
                        lay of one or more days  from  this  date  before  the
                        maintenance action is applied.

                     OptInStatus -> (string)
                        Indicates the type of opt-in request that has been re-
                        ceived for the resource.

                     CurrentApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                        The effective date when the pending maintenance action
                        is  applied  to the resource. This date takes into ac-
                        count opt-in requests received from the  ApplyPending-
                        MaintenanceAction  API, the AutoAppliedAfterDate , and
                        the ForcedApplyDate . This value is blank if an opt-in
                        request  has  not  been  received and nothing has been
                        specified as AutoAppliedAfterDate or ForcedApplyDate .

                     Description -> (string)
                        A description providing more detail about the  mainte-
                        nance action.

       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous DescribePending-
          MaintenanceActions request. If this parameter is specified, the  re-
          sponse  includes  only  records beyond the marker, up to a number of
