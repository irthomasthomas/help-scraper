START-EXPORT-TASK()                                        START-EXPORT-TASK()



NAME
       start-export-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  an  export  of DB snapshot or DB cluster data to Amazon S3. The
       provided IAM role must have access to the S3 bucket.

       You can't export snapshot data from RDS Custom DB instances.

       You can't export cluster data from Multi-AZ DB clusters.

       For more information on exporting DB snapshot data,  see  Exporting  DB
       snapshot data to Amazon S3 in the Amazon RDS User Guide or Exporting DB
       cluster snapshot data to Amazon S3 in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

       For more information on exporting DB cluster  data,  see  Exporting  DB
       cluster data to Amazon S3 in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --export-task-identifier (string)
          A unique identifier for the export task. This ID isn't an identifier
          for the Amazon S3 bucket where the data is to be exported.

       --source-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the snapshot or cluster to  export
          to Amazon S3.

       --s3-bucket-name (string)
          The  name  of the Amazon S3 bucket to export the snapshot or cluster
          data to.

       --iam-role-arn (string)
          The name of the IAM role to use for writing to the Amazon S3  bucket
          when exporting a snapshot or cluster.

          In  the  IAM policy attached to your IAM role, include the following
          required actions to allow the transfer of files from Amazon  RDS  or
          Amazon Aurora to an S3 bucket:

          o s3:PutObject*

          o s3:GetObject*

          o s3:ListBucket

          o s3:DeleteObject*

          o s3:GetBucketLocation

          In  the  policy, include the resources to identify the S3 bucket and
          objects in the bucket. The following list  of  resources  shows  the
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for accessing S3:

          o

            ``
            arn:aws:s3:::your-s3-bucket ``

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 130)
            Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          o arn:aws:s3:::*your-s3-bucket* /*

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services KMS key to use to encrypt the data
          exported to Amazon S3. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is
          the  key  ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. The
          caller of this operation must be authorized to run the following op-
          erations.  These  can be set in the Amazon Web Services KMS key pol-
          icy:

          o kms:Encrypt

          o kms:Decrypt

          o kms:GenerateDataKey

          o kms:GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext

          o kms:ReEncryptFrom

          o kms:ReEncryptTo

          o kms:CreateGrant

          o kms:DescribeKey

          o kms:RetireGrant

       --s3-prefix (string)
          The Amazon S3 bucket prefix to use as the file name and path of  the
          exported data.

       --export-only (list)
          The data to be exported from the snapshot or cluster. If this param-
          eter is not provided, all of the data is exported. Valid values  are
          the following:

          o database - Export all the data from a specified database.

          o database.table   table-name  -  Export  a table of the snapshot or
            cluster. This format is valid only for  RDS  for  MySQL,  RDS  for
            MariaDB, and Aurora MySQL.

          o database.schema   schema-name  -  Export  a database schema of the
            snapshot or cluster. This format is valid only for RDS  for  Post-
            greSQL and Aurora PostgreSQL.

          o database.schema.table  table-name - Export a table of the database
            schema. This format is valid only for RDS for PostgreSQL  and  Au-
            rora PostgreSQL.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To export a snapshot to Amazon S3

       The  following  start-export-task  example  exports a DB snapshot named
       db5-snapshot-test to the Amazon S3 bucket named mybucket.
