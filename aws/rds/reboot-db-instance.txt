REBOOT-DB-INSTANCE()                                      REBOOT-DB-INSTANCE()



NAME
       reboot-db-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       You might need to reboot your DB instance, usually for maintenance rea-
       sons. For example, if you make certain modifications, or if you  change
       the DB parameter group associated with the DB instance, you must reboot
       the instance for the changes to take effect.

       Rebooting a DB instance restarts the database engine service. Rebooting
       a  DB  instance  results in a momentary outage, during which the DB in-
       stance status is set to rebooting.

       For more information about rebooting, see Rebooting a  DB  Instance  in
       the Amazon RDS User Guide.

       This command doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       If  your  DB  instance is part of a Multi-AZ DB cluster, you can reboot
       the DB cluster with the RebootDBCluster operation.

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The DB instance identifier. This parameter is stored as a  lowercase
          string.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing DBInstance.

       --force-failover | --no-force-failover (boolean)
          A  value  that  indicates  whether the reboot is conducted through a
          Multi-AZ failover.

          Constraint: You can't enable force failover if  the  instance  isn't
          configured for Multi-AZ.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name Sys-
              tem  (DNS)  endpoint  resolves  to  the  private IP address from
              within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves
              to  the  public IP address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC.
              Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by  the  secu-
              rity  group  it  uses. That public access isn't permitted if the
              security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

              When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an  inter-
              nal  DB  instance  with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP
              address.

                     the following values:

                     o ACTIVE - the IAM role ARN is associated with the DB in-
                       stance and can be used to access other Amazon Web  Ser-
                       vices services on your behalf.

                     o PENDING - the IAM role ARN is being associated with the
                       DB instance.

                     o INVALID - the IAM role ARN is associated  with  the  DB
                       instance,  but  the DB instance is unable to assume the
                       IAM role in order to access other Amazon  Web  Services
                       services on your behalf.

              activity stream.

          ActivityStreamMode -> (string)
              The mode of the database activity stream. Database  events  such
              as a change or access generate an activity stream event. RDS for
              Oracle always handles these events asynchronously.

          ActivityStreamEngineNativeAuditFieldsIncluded -> (boolean)

              for the duration set by --resume-full-automation-mode-minutes .

          ResumeFullAutomationModeTime -> (timestamp)
              The number of minutes to pause the automation. When the time pe-
              riod ends, RDS Custom resumes full automation. The minimum value
              is 60 (default). The maximum value is 1,440.

          CustomIamInstanceProfile -> (string)
              The instance profile associated with the underlying  Amazon  EC2
              instance of an RDS Custom DB instance. The instance profile must

              o The profile must have an IAM role that Amazon EC2 has  permis-
                sions to assume.

              o The  instance  profile  name  and the associated IAM role name
                must start with the prefix AWSRDSCustom .

          NetworkType -> (string)
              The network type of the DB instance.

              Valid values:

              o IPV4

              o DUAL

              The  network  type  is determined by the DBSubnetGroup specified
              for the DB instance. A DBSubnetGroup can support only  the  IPv4
              protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (DUAL ).

              For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in
              the Amazon RDS User Guide and Working with a DB  instance  in  a

              Contains  the  secret  managed by RDS in Amazon Web Services Se-
              crets Manager for the master user password.

              For more information, see Password management  with  Amazon  Web
              Services Secrets Manager in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

              SecretArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret.

              SecretStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the secret.

                 The possible status values include the following:

                 o creating - The secret is being created.

                 o active  -  The secret is available for normal use and rota-
                   tion.

                 o rotating - The secret is being rotated.

                 o impaired - The secret can be used to access  database  cre-
                   dentials, but it can't be rotated. A secret might have this
                   status if, for example, permissions are changed so that RDS
                   can  no  longer access either the secret or the KMS key for
                   the secret. When a secret has this status, you can  correct
                   the condition that caused the status. Alternatively, modify
                   the DB instance to turn off automatic management  of  data-
                   base  credentials, and then modify the DB instance again to
                   turn on automatic management of database credentials.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier that  is  used  to
                 encrypt the secret.
