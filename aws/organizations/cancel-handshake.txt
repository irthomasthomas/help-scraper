CANCEL-HANDSHAKE()                                          CANCEL-HANDSHAKE()



NAME
       cancel-handshake -

DESCRIPTION
       Cancels  a handshake. Canceling a handshake sets the handshake state to
       CANCELED .

       This operation can be called only from the account that originated  the
       handshake.  The recipient of the handshake can't cancel it, but can use
       DeclineHandshake instead. After a handshake is canceled, the  recipient
       can no longer respond to that handshake.

       After  you cancel a handshake, it continues to appear in the results of
       relevant APIs for only 30 days. After that, it's deleted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            cancel-handshake
          --handshake-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --handshake-id (string)
          The unique identifier (ID) of the handshake that you want to cancel.
          You  can  get  the ID from the  ListHandshakesForOrganization opera-
          tion.

          The regex pattern for handshake ID string requires "h-" followed  by
          from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To cancel a handshake sent from another account

       Bill previously sent an invitation to Susan's account to join his orga-
       nization. He changes his mind and decides to cancel the invitation  be-
       fore Susan accepts it. The following example shows Bill's cancellation:

          aws organizations cancel-handshake --handshake-id h-examplehandshakeid111

       The output includes a handshake object that shows that the state is now
       CANCELED:

OUTPUT
       Handshake -> (structure)
          A structure that contains details about the handshake that you  can-
          celed.

          Id -> (string)
              The  unique  identifier (ID) of a handshake. The originating ac-
              count creates the ID when it initiates the handshake.

              The regex pattern for handshake ID string requires "h-" followed
              by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a handshake.

              For  more  information about ARNs in Organizations, see ARN For-
              mats Supported by Organizations in the Amazon Web Services  Ser-
              vice Authorization Reference .

          Parties -> (list)
              Information about the two accounts that are participating in the
              handshake.

              (structure)
                 Identifies a participant in a handshake.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The unique identifier (ID) for the party.

                     The regex pattern for handshake ID string  requires  "h-"
                     followed by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of party.

          State -> (string)
              The  current  state of the handshake. Use the state to trace the
              flow of the handshake through the process from its  creation  to
              its  acceptance.  The  meaning of each of the valid values is as
              follows:

              o REQUESTED : This handshake was  sent  to  multiple  recipients
                (applicable  to only some handshake types) and not all recipi-
                ents have responded yet. The request stays in this state until
                all recipients respond.

              o OPEN  : This handshake was sent to multiple recipients (appli-
                cable to only some policy types) and all recipients  have  re-
                sponded, allowing the originator to complete the handshake ac-
                tion.

              o CANCELED : This handshake is no longer active because  it  was
                canceled by the originating account.

              o ACCEPTED  : This handshake is complete because it has been ac-
                cepted by the recipient.

              o DECLINED : This handshake is no longer active because  it  was
                declined by the recipient account.

              o EXPIRED : This handshake is no longer active because the orig-
                inator did not receive a response of any kind from the recipi-
                ent before the expiration time (15 days).

          RequestedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the handshake request was made.

          ExpirationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and time that the handshake expires. If the recipient
              of the handshake request fails to respond before  the  specified
              date  and  time, the handshake becomes inactive and is no longer
              valid.

          Action -> (string)
              The type of handshake, indicating what action  occurs  when  the
              recipient  accepts  the handshake. The following handshake types
              are supported:

              o INVITE : This type of handshake represents a request  to  join
                an organization. It is always sent from the management account
                to only non-member accounts.

              o ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES : This type of handshake represents a  re-
                quest  to enable all features in an organization. It is always
                sent from the management account to only  invited  member  ac-
                counts. Created accounts do not receive this because those ac-
                counts were created by the organization's  management  account
                and approval is inferred.

              o APPROVE_ALL_FEATURES : This type of handshake is sent from the
                Organizations service when all member accounts  have  approved
                the  ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES  invitation.  It  is sent only to the
                management account and signals the master that it can finalize
                the process to enable all features.

          Resources -> (list)
              Additional information that is needed to process the handshake.

              (structure)
                 Contains  additional  data  that is needed to process a hand-
                 shake.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The information that is passed to the other party in  the
                     handshake.  The format of the value string must match the
                     requirements of the specified type.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of information being passed, specifying how  the
                     value is to be interpreted by the other party:

                     o NOTES  - Additional text provided by the handshake ini-
                       tiator and intended for the recipient to read.

                 Resources -> (list)
                     When needed, contains an additional array of HandshakeRe-
                     source objects.

                     (structure)
                        Contains  additional  data that is needed to process a
                        handshake.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The information that is passed to the other  party
                            in  the  handshake. The format of the value string
