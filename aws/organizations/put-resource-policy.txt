OPTIONS
       --content (string)
          If provided, the new content for the resource policy. The text  must
          be  correctly  formatted  JSON that complies with the syntax for the
          resource policy's type. For more information, see SCP syntax in  the
          Organizations User Guide .

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags that you want to attach to the newly created resource
          policy. For each tag in the list, you must specify both  a  tag  key
          and a value. You can set the value to an empty string, but you can't
          set it to null . For more information about tagging, see Tagging Or-
          ganizations resources in the Organizations User Guide.

          NOTE:
              Calls  with  tags  apply to the initial creation of the resource
              policy, otherwise an exception is thrown. If any one of the tags
              is not valid or if you exceed the allowed number of tags for the
              resource policy, then the entire request fails and the  resource
              policy is not created.

          (structure)
              A  custom  key-value pair associated with a resource within your
              organization.

              You can attach tags to any of  the  following  organization  re-
              sources.

              o Amazon Web Services account

              o Organizational unit (OU)

              o Organization root

              o Policy

              Key -> (string)
                 The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  string  value that's associated with the key of the tag.
                 You can set the value of a tag to an empty  string,  but  you
                 can't set the value of a tag to null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
