NAME
       describe-organization -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about  the organization that the user's account
       belongs to.

       This operation can be called from any account in the organization.

       NOTE:
          Even if a policy type is shown as available in the organization, you
          can  disable it separately at the root level with  DisablePolicyType
          . Use  ListRoots to see the status of policy types for  a  specified
          root.

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about the current organization

       The following example shows you how to request details about an organi-
       zation:

          aws organizations describe-organization

       The output includes an organization object that has the  details  about
       the organization:

          {
                  "Organization": {
                          "MasterAccountArn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:account/o-exampleorgid/111111111111",
                          "MasterAccountEmail": "bill@example.com",

              to  "CONSOLIDATED_BILLING", then only consolidated billing func-
              tionality is available. For more information, see  Enabling  All

              WARNING:
                 Do not use. This field is deprecated and doesn't provide com-
                 plete information about the policies in your organization.

              To determine the policies that are enabled and available for use
              in your organization, use the  ListRoots operation instead.

              (structure)
                 Contains information about a policy type and  its  status  in
                 the associated root.

                 Type -> (string)

                     The  status of the policy type as it relates to the asso-
                     ciated root. To attach a policy of the specified type  to
                     a  root  or  to an OU or account in that root, it must be
                     available in the organization and enabled for that root.
