LIST-HANDSHAKES-FOR-ORGANIZATION()          LIST-HANDSHAKES-FOR-ORGANIZATION()



NAME
       list-handshakes-for-organization -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the handshakes that are associated with the organization that the
       requesting user is part of. The ListHandshakesForOrganization operation
       returns a list of handshake structures. Each structure contains details
       and status about a handshake.

       Handshakes that are ACCEPTED , DECLINED , CANCELED , or EXPIRED  appear
       in  the  results  of  this  API for only 30 days after changing to that
       state. After that, they're deleted and no longer accessible.

       NOTE:
          Always check the NextToken response parameter for a null value  when
          calling  a List* operation. These operations can occasionally return
          an empty set of results even when there are more results  available.
          The  NextToken response parameter value is null  only when there are
          no more results to display.

       This operation can be called only from  the  organization's  management
       account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an
       Amazon Web Services service.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-handshakes-for-organization is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: Handshakes

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          A  filter  of the handshakes that you want included in the response.
          The default is all types. Use the ActionType element  to  limit  the
          output  to  only  a specified type, such as INVITE , ENABLE-ALL-FEA-
          TURES  ,  or  APPROVE-ALL-FEATURES  .  Alternatively,  for  the  EN-
          ABLE-ALL-FEATURES  handshake  that  generates a separate child hand-
          shake for each member account, you can specify the ParentHandshakeId
          to  see  only  the handshakes that were generated by that parent re-
          quest.

          ActionType -> (string)
              Specifies the type of handshake action.

              If you specify ActionType , you cannot also specify  ParentHand-
              shakeId .

          ParentHandshakeId -> (string)
              Specifies  the  parent  handshake. Only used for handshake types
              that are a child of another type.

              If you specify ParentHandshakeId , you cannot also  specify  Ac-
              tionType .

              The regex pattern for handshake ID string requires "h-" followed
              by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ActionType=string,ParentHandshakeId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ActionType": "INVITE"|"ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES"|"APPROVE_ALL_FEATURES"|"ADD_ORGANIZATIONS_SERVICE_LINKED_ROLE",
            "ParentHandshakeId": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve a list of the handshakes associated with an organization

       The  following  example  shows how to get a list of handshakes that are
       associated with the current organization:

          aws organizations list-handshakes-for-organization

       The output shows two handshakes. The first  one  is  an  invitation  to
       Juan's  account  and shows a state of OPEN. The second is an invitation
       to Anika's account and shows a state of ACCEPTED:

          {
                  "Handshakes": [

OUTPUT
       Handshakes -> (list)
          A list of  Handshake objects with details about each  of  the  hand-
          shakes that are associated with an organization.

          (structure)
              Contains  information  that must be exchanged to securely estab-
              lish a relationship between two accounts (an  originator  and  a
              recipient  ). For example, when a management account (the origi-
              nator) invites another account (the recipient) to join its orga-
              nization,  the  two accounts exchange information as a series of
              handshake requests and responses.
                 Note: Handshakes that are CANCELED , ACCEPTED , DECLINED , or
                 EXPIRED show up in lists for only 30 days after entering that
                 state After that they are deleted.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier (ID) of a  handshake.  The  originating
                 account creates the ID when it initiates the handshake.

                 The  regex pattern for handshake ID string requires "h-" fol-
                 lowed by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a handshake.

                 For more information about ARNs  in  Organizations,  see  ARN
                 Formats Supported by Organizations in the Amazon Web Services
                 Service Authorization Reference .

              Parties -> (list)
                 Information about the two accounts that are participating  in
                 the handshake.

                 (structure)
                     Identifies a participant in a handshake.

                     Id -> (string)
                        The unique identifier (ID) for the party.

                        The  regex  pattern  for  handshake ID string requires
                        "h-" followed by from 8 to  32  lowercase  letters  or
                        digits.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The type of party.

              State -> (string)
                 The  current  state  of the handshake. Use the state to trace
                 the flow of the handshake through the process from  its  cre-
                 ation  to  its  acceptance.  The meaning of each of the valid
                 values is as follows:

                 o REQUESTED : This handshake was sent to multiple  recipients
                   (applicable  to  only some handshake types) and not all re-
                   cipients have responded yet.  The  request  stays  in  this
                   state until all recipients respond.

                 o OPEN  : This handshake was sent to multiple recipients (ap-
                   plicable to only some policy types) and all recipients have
                   responded,  allowing  the  originator to complete the hand-
                   shake action.

                 o CANCELED : This handshake is no longer  active  because  it
                   was canceled by the originating account.

                 o ACCEPTED  :  This handshake is complete because it has been
                   accepted by the recipient.

                 o DECLINED : This handshake is no longer  active  because  it
                   was declined by the recipient account.

                 o EXPIRED  :  This  handshake is no longer active because the
                   originator did not receive a response of any kind from  the
                   recipient before the expiration time (15 days).

              RequestedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the handshake request was made.

              ExpirationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time that the handshake expires. If the recipi-
                 ent of the handshake request  fails  to  respond  before  the
                 specified  date  and time, the handshake becomes inactive and
                 is no longer valid.

              Action -> (string)
                 The type of handshake, indicating what action occurs when the
                 recipient  accepts  the  handshake.  The  following handshake
                 types are supported:

                 o INVITE : This type of handshake  represents  a  request  to
                   join an organization. It is always sent from the management
                   account to only non-member accounts.

                 o ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES : This type of handshake  represents  a
                   request  to  enable  all features in an organization. It is
                   always sent from the management  account  to  only  invited
                   member  accounts.  Created accounts do not receive this be-
                   cause those accounts were  created  by  the  organization's
                   management account and approval is inferred.

                 o APPROVE_ALL_FEATURES  : This type of handshake is sent from
                   the Organizations service when all member accounts have ap-
                   proved  the ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES invitation. It is sent only
                   to the management account and signals the  master  that  it
                   can finalize the process to enable all features.

              Resources -> (list)
