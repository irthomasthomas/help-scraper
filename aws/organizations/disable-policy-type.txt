DISABLE-POLICY-TYPE()                                    DISABLE-POLICY-TYPE()



NAME
       disable-policy-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Disables an organizational policy type in a root. A policy of a certain
       type can be attached to entities in a root only if that type is enabled
       in the root. After you perform this operation, you no longer can attach
       policies of the specified type to that root or  to  any  organizational
       unit  (OU) or account in that root. You can undo this by using the  En-
       ablePolicyType operation.

       This is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web  Services  performs  in
       the  background.  If you disable a policy type for a root, it still ap-
       pears enabled for the organization if all features are enabled for  the
       organization.  Amazon Web Services recommends that you first use  List-
       Roots to see the status of policy types for a specified root, and  then
       use this operation.

       This  operation  can  be called only from the organization's management
       account.

       To view the status of available policy types in the  organization,  use
       DescribeOrganization .

OPTIONS
       --root-id (string)
          The  unique identifier (ID) of the root in which you want to disable
          a policy type. You can get the ID from the  ListRoots operation.

          The regex pattern for a root ID string  requires  "r-"  followed  by
          from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

       --policy-type (string)
          The policy type that you want to disable in this root. You can spec-
          ify one of the following values:

          o AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY

          o BACKUP_POLICY

          o SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY

          o TAG_POLICY

          Possible values:

          o SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY

          o TAG_POLICY

          o BACKUP_POLICY

          o AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To disable a policy type in a root

       The following example shows how to disable the service  control  policy
       (SCP) policy type in a root:

          aws organizations disable-policy-type --root-id r-examplerootid111 --policy-type SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY

       The  output  shows  that the PolicyTypes response element no longer in-
       cludes SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY:

          {
                  "Root": {
                          "PolicyTypes": [],
                          "Name": "Root",
                          "Id": "r-examplerootid111",
                          "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:root/o-exampleorgid/r-examplerootid111"
                  }
          }

OUTPUT
       Root -> (structure)
          A structure that shows the root with the  updated  list  of  enabled
          policy types.

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier (ID) for the root.

              The regex pattern for a root ID string requires "r-" followed by
              from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the root.

              For more information about ARNs in Organizations, see  ARN  For-
              mats  Supported by Organizations in the Amazon Web Services Ser-
              vice Authorization Reference .

          Name -> (string)
              The friendly name of the root.

              The regex pattern that is used to validate this parameter  is  a
              string of any of the characters in the ASCII character range.

          PolicyTypes -> (list)
              The  types  of  policies that are currently enabled for the root
              and therefore can be attached to the root or to its OUs  or  ac-
              counts.

              NOTE:
                 Even  if a policy type is shown as available in the organiza-
                 tion, you can separately enable and disable them at the  root
                 level by using  EnablePolicyType and  DisablePolicyType . Use
                 DescribeOrganization to see the availability  of  the  policy
                 types in that organization.

              (structure)
                 Contains  information  about  a policy type and its status in
                 the associated root.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The name of the policy type.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The status of the policy type as it relates to the  asso-
                     ciated  root. To attach a policy of the specified type to
                     a root or to an OU or account in that root,  it  must  be
                     available in the organization and enabled for that root.
