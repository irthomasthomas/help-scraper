NAME
       describe-create-account-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  current  status of an asynchronous request to create an
       account.

       This operation can be called only from  the  organization's  management
       account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an
       Amazon Web Services service.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-create-account-status
          --create-account-request-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --create-account-request-id (string)
          Specifies the Id value that uniquely  identifies  the  CreateAccount
          request.  You  can get the value from the CreateAccountStatus.Id re-
          sponse in an earlier  CreateAccount request, or from  the   ListCre-
          ateAccountStatus operation.

          The  regex  pattern  for a create account request ID string requires
          "car-" followed by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the latest status about a request to create an account

       The following example shows how to request the latest status for a pre-
       vious request to create an account in an  organization.  The  specified
       --request-id comes from the response of the original call to create-ac-
       count. The account creation request shows by the status field that  Or-
       ganizations successfully completed the creation of the account.

       Command:

          aws organizations describe-create-account-status --create-account-request-id car-examplecreateaccountrequestid111

       Output:

          {
            "CreateAccountStatus": {
              "State": "SUCCEEDED",
              "AccountId": "555555555555",
              "AccountName": "Beta account",
              "RequestedTimestamp": 1470684478.687,
              "CompletedTimestamp": 1470684532.472,
              "Id": "car-examplecreateaccountrequestid111"
            }
          }

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier (ID) that references this request. You get

              quest to create the account.

              The regex pattern for a create account  request  ID  string  re-
