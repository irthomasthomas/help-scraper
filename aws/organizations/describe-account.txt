NAME
       describe-account -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  Organizations-related  information  about  the specified ac-
       count.

       This operation can be called only from  the  organization's  management
       account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an
       Amazon Web Services service.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-account
          --account-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The unique identifier (ID) of the Amazon Web Services  account  that
          you  want  information  about.  You can get the ID from the  ListAc-
          counts or  ListAccountsForParent operations.

          The regex pattern for an account ID string requires exactly 12  dig-
          its.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
