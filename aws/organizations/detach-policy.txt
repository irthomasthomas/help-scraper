DETACH-POLICY()                                                DETACH-POLICY()



NAME
       detach-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Detaches  a policy from a target root, organizational unit (OU), or ac-
       count.

       WARNING:
          If the policy being detached is a service control policy (SCP),  the
          changes  to  permissions  for  Identity  and Access Management (IAM)
          users and roles in affected accounts are immediate.

       Every root, OU, and account must have at least one SCP attached. If you
       want  to replace the default FullAWSAccess policy with an SCP that lim-
       its the permissions that can be delegated, you must attach the replace-
       ment  SCP before you can remove the default SCP. This is the authoriza-
       tion strategy of an "allow list ". If you instead attach a  second  SCP
       and  leave  the FullAWSAccess SCP still attached, and specify "Effect":
       "Deny" in the second SCP to  override  the  "Effect":  "Allow"  in  the
       FullAWSAccess  policy (or any other attached SCP), you're using the au-
       thorization strategy of a "deny list ".

       This operation can be called only from  the  organization's  management
       account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an
       Amazon Web Services service.

OPTIONS
       --policy-id (string)
          The unique identifier (ID) of the policy you want to detach. You can
          get  the  ID from the  ListPolicies or  ListPoliciesForTarget opera-
          tions.

          The regex pattern for a policy ID string requires "p-"  followed  by
          from  8 to 128 lowercase or uppercase letters, digits, or the under-
          score character (_).

       --target-id (string)
          The unique identifier (ID) of the root, OU, or account that you want
          to  detach the policy from. You can get the ID from the  ListRoots ,
          ListOrganizationalUnitsForParent , or  ListAccounts operations.

          The regex pattern for a target ID string requires one of the follow-
          ing:

          o Root  -  A  string  that begins with "r-" followed by from 4 to 32
            lowercase letters or digits.

          o Account - A string that consists of exactly 12 digits.

          o Organizational unit (OU) - A string that begins  with  "ou-"  fol-
            lowed  by  from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID of the
            root that the OU is in). This string is followed by a  second  "-"
            dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To detach a policy from a root, OU, or account

       The following example shows how to detach a policy from an OU:

          aws organizations  detach-policy  --target-id ou-examplerootid111-exampleouid111 --policy-id p-examplepolicyid111

OUTPUT
       None
