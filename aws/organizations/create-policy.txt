OPTIONS
       --content (string)
          The  policy text content to add to the new policy. The text that you
          supply must adhere to the rules of the policy type  you  specify  in
          the Type parameter.

       --description (string)
          An optional description to assign to the policy.

       --name (string)
          The friendly name to assign to the policy.

          The  regex  pattern  that  is  used  to validate this parameter is a
          string of any of the characters in the ASCII character range.

       --type (string)
          The type of policy to create. You can specify one of  the  following
          values:

          o AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY

          o BACKUP_POLICY

          o SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY

          o TAG_POLICY

          Possible values:

          o SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY

          o TAG_POLICY

          o BACKUP_POLICY

          o AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY

       --tags (list)
          A  list of tags that you want to attach to the newly created policy.
          For each tag in the list, you must specify both  a  tag  key  and  a
          value.  You  can set the value to an empty string, but you can't set
          it to null . For more information about tagging, see Tagging Organi-
          zations resources in the Organizations User Guide.

          NOTE:
              If  any  one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed
              number of tags for a policy, then the entire request  fails  and
              the policy is not created.

          (structure)
              A  custom  key-value pair associated with a resource within your
              organization.

              You can attach tags to any of  the  following  organization  re-
              sources.

              o Amazon Web Services account

              o Organizational unit (OU)

              o Organization root

              o Policy

              Key -> (string)
                 The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  string  value that's associated with the key of the tag.
                 You can set the value of a tag to an empty  string,  but  you
                 can't set the value of a tag to null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create a policy with a text source file for the JSON pol-
       icy

       The following example shows you how to create an service control policy
       (SCP)  named  AllowAllS3Actions.  The  policy contents are taken from a
       file on the local computer called policy.json.

          aws organizations create-policy --content file://policy.json --name AllowAllS3Actions, --type SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY --description "Allows delegation of all S3 actions"

       The output includes a policy object with details about the new policy:

          {
                  "Policy": {
                          "Content": "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":[\"s3:*\"],\"Resource\":[\"*\"]}]}",
                          "PolicySummary": {
                                  "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::o-exampleorgid:policy/service_control_policy/p-examplepolicyid111",
                                  "Description": "Allows delegation of all S3 actions",
                                  "Name": "AllowAllS3Actions",
                                  "Type":"SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY"
                          }
                  }
          }

       Example 2: To create a policy with a JSON policy as a parameter

       The following example shows you how to create the same SCP,  this  time
       by embedding the policy contents as a JSON string in the parameter. The
       string must be escaped with backslashes before the double quotes to en-
       sure  that  they are treated as literals in the parameter, which itself
       is surrounded by double quotes:

          aws organizations create-policy --content "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":[\"s3:*\"],\"Resource\":[\"*\"]}]}" --name AllowAllS3Actions --type SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY --description "Allows delegation of all S3 actions"

       zation,  see  Managing  Organization  Policies in the AWS Organizations
       User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Policy -> (structure)
          A structure that contains details about the newly created policy.

          PolicySummary -> (structure)
              A structure that contains additional details about the policy.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier (ID) of the policy.

                 The regex pattern for a policy ID string requires  "p-"  fol-
                 lowed  by  from 8 to 128 lowercase or uppercase letters, dig-
                 its, or the underscore character (_).

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy.

                 For more information about ARNs  in  Organizations,  see  ARN
                 Formats Supported by Organizations in the Amazon Web Services
                 Service Authorization Reference .

              Name -> (string)
                 The friendly name of the policy.

                 The regex pattern that is used to validate this parameter  is
                 a  string  of  any  of  the characters in the ASCII character
                 range.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the policy.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of policy.

              AwsManaged -> (boolean)
                 A boolean value that indicates whether the  specified  policy
                 is  an  Amazon Web Services managed policy. If true, then you
                 can attach the policy to roots, OUs,  or  accounts,  but  you
                 cannot edit it.

          Content -> (string)
              The text content of the policy.
