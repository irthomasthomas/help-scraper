REMOVE-ACCOUNT-FROM-ORGANIZATION()          REMOVE-ACCOUNT-FROM-ORGANIZATION()



NAME
       remove-account-from-organization -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes the specified account from the organization.

       The removed account becomes a standalone account that isn't a member of
       any organization. It's no longer subject to any policies and is respon-
       sible  for its own bill payments. The organization's management account
       is no longer charged for any expenses accrued by the member account af-
       ter it's removed from the organization.

       This  operation  can  be called only from the organization's management
       account. Member accounts can remove themselves with   LeaveOrganization
       instead.

       WARNING:

          o You  can  remove an account from your organization only if the ac-
            count is configured with the information required to operate as  a
            standalone  account. When you create an account in an organization
            using the Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the  infor-
            mation  required  of standalone accounts is not automatically col-
            lected. For more information, see Considerations  before  removing
            an account from an organization in the Organizations User Guide .

          o The  account that you want to leave must not be a delegated admin-
            istrator account for any Amazon Web Services service  enabled  for
            your  organization.  If  the account is a delegated administrator,
            you must first change the delegated administrator account  to  an-
            other account that is remaining in the organization.

          o After  the account leaves the organization, all tags that were at-
            tached to the account object in the organization are deleted. Ama-
            zon  Web  Services accounts outside of an organization do not sup-
            port tags.

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The unique identifier (ID) of the member account that  you  want  to
          remove from the organization.

          The  regex pattern for an account ID string requires exactly 12 dig-
          its.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
