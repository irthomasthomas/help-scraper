NAME
       remove-account-from-organization -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes the specified account from the organization.

       The removed account becomes a standalone account that isn't a member of
       any organization. It's no longer subject to any policies and is respon-
       sible  for its own bill payments. The organization's management account
       is no longer charged for any expenses accrued by the member account af-
       ter it's removed from the organization.

       This  operation  can  be called only from the organization's management
       account. Member accounts can remove themselves with   LeaveOrganization
       instead.

       WARNING:

          o You  can  remove an account from your organization only if the ac-
            count is configured with the information required to operate as  a
            standalone  account. When you create an account in an organization
            using the Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the  infor-
            mation  required  of standalone accounts is not automatically col-
            lected. For an account that you want to make standalone, you  must
            choose a support plan, provide and verify the required contact in-
            formation, and provide a current payment method. Amazon  Web  Ser-
            vices uses the payment method to charge for any billable (not free
            tier) Amazon Web Services activity that occurs while  the  account
            isn't  attached  to  an  organization.  To  remove an account that
            doesn't yet have this information, you must sign in as the  member
            account  and follow the steps at To leave an organization when all
            required account information has not yet been provided in the  Or-
            ganizations User Guide.

          o The  account that you want to leave must not be a delegated admin-
            istrator account for any Amazon Web Services service  enabled  for
            your  organization.  If  the account is a delegated administrator,
            you must first change the delegated administrator account  to  an-
            other account that is remaining in the organization.

          o After  the account leaves the organization, all tags that were at-
            tached to the account object in the organization are deleted. Ama-
            zon  Web  Services accounts outside of an organization do not sup-
            port tags.

SYNOPSIS
            remove-account-from-organization
          --account-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The unique identifier (ID) of the member account that  you  want  to
          remove from the organization.

          The  regex pattern for an account ID string requires exactly 12 dig-
          its.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
