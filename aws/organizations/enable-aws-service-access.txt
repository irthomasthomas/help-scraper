ENABLE-AWS-SERVICE-ACCESS()                        ENABLE-AWS-SERVICE-ACCESS()



NAME
       enable-aws-service-access -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables  the integration of an Amazon Web Services service (the service
       that is specified by ServicePrincipal ) with  Organizations.  When  you
       enable  integration,  you  allow  the  specified  service  to  create a
       service-linked role in all the accounts in your organization. This  al-
       lows the service to perform operations on your behalf in your organiza-
       tion and its accounts.

       WARNING:
          We recommend that you enable integration between  Organizations  and
          the  specified  Amazon  Web Services service by using the console or
          commands that are provided by the specified service.  Doing  so  en-
          sures  that  the  service  is aware that it can create the resources
          that are required for the integration. How the service creates those
          resources  in  the  organization's accounts depends on that service.
          For more information, see the documentation for the other Amazon Web
          Services service.

       For  more information about enabling services to integrate with Organi-
       zations, see Integrating Organizations with Other Amazon  Web  Services
       Services in the Organizations User Guide.

       This  operation  can  be called only from the organization's management
       account and only if the organization has enabled all features .

SYNOPSIS
            enable-aws-service-access
          --service-principal <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-principal (string)
          The service principal name of the Amazon Web  Services  service  for
          which you want to enable integration with your organization. This is
          typically in the form of a  URL,  such  as  ``  service-abbreviation
          .amazonaws.com`` .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
