CREATE-GOV-CLOUD-ACCOUNT()                          CREATE-GOV-CLOUD-ACCOUNT()



NAME
       create-gov-cloud-account -

DESCRIPTION
       This action is available if all of the following are true:

       o You're  authorized to create accounts in the Amazon Web Services Gov-
         Cloud (US) Region. For more information on the  Amazon  Web  Services
         GovCloud  (US)  Region,  see  the ` Amazon Web Services GovCloud User
         Guide                              .                               <-
         https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/wel-
         come.html>`__

       o You already have an account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud  (US)
         Region that is paired with a management account of an organization in
         the commercial Region.

       o You call this action from the management account of your organization
         in the commercial Region.

       o You have the organizations:CreateGovCloudAccount permission.

       Organizations  automatically  creates  the required service-linked role
       named  AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations  .  For  more  information,   see
       Organizations  and service-linked roles in the Organizations User Guide
       .

       Amazon Web Services automatically enables  CloudTrail  for  Amazon  Web
       Services GovCloud (US) accounts, but you should also do the following:

       o Verify that CloudTrail is enabled to store logs.

       o Create  an  Amazon S3 bucket for CloudTrail log storage. For more in-
         formation, see Verifying CloudTrail Is Enabled in the Amazon Web Ser-
         vices GovCloud User Guide .

       If  the request includes tags, then the requester must have the organi-
       zations:TagResource permission. The tags are attached to the commercial
       account  associated with the GovCloud account, rather than the GovCloud
       account itself. To add tags to the GovCloud account, call  the   TagRe-
       source  operation in the GovCloud Region after the new GovCloud account
       exists.

       You call this action from the management account of  your  organization
       in the commercial Region to create a standalone Amazon Web Services ac-
       count in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region.  After  the  ac-
       count is created, the management account of an organization in the Ama-
       zon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region can invite it to  that  organiza-
       tion.  For more information on inviting standalone accounts in the Ama-
       zon  Web  Services  GovCloud  (US)  to  join   an   organization,   see
       Organizations in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide .

       Calling  CreateGovCloudAccount  is  an asynchronous request that Amazon
       Web Services performs in the background. Because  CreateGovCloudAccount
       operates  asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message
       even though account initialization might  still  be  in  progress.  You
       might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the
       account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:

       o Use the OperationId response element from this operation  to  provide
         as a parameter to the  DescribeCreateAccountStatus operation.

       o Check  the  CloudTrail log for the CreateAccountResult event. For in-
         formation on using CloudTrail with  Organizations,  see  Logging  and
         monitoring in Organizations in the Organizations User Guide .

       When  you  call  the  CreateGovCloudAccount  action, you create two ac-
       counts: a standalone account in the Amazon Web Services  GovCloud  (US)
       Region  and  an associated account in the commercial Region for billing
       and support purposes. The account in the commercial Region is automati-
       cally  a member of the organization whose credentials made the request.
       Both accounts are associated with the same email address.

       A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that  al-
       lows  the  management account in the organization in the commercial Re-
       gion to assume it. An Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account is then
       created  and  associated with the commercial account that you just cre-
       ated. A role is also created in the new Amazon  Web  Services  GovCloud
       (US)  account  that  can be assumed by the Amazon Web Services GovCloud
       (US) account that is associated with the management account of the com-
       mercial  organization.  For more information and to view a diagram that
       explains how account access works, see Organizations in the Amazon  Web
       Services GovCloud User Guide .

       For more information about creating accounts, see Creating a member ac-
       count in your organization in the Organizations User Guide .

       WARNING:

          o When you create an account in an organization using the  Organiza-
            tions  console, API, or CLI commands, the information required for
            the account to operate as a standalone account  is  not  automati-
            cally  collected.  This  includes a payment method and signing the
            end user license agreement (EULA). If you must remove  an  account
            from your organization later, you can do so only after you provide
            the missing information. For more information, see  Considerations
            before  removing  an account from an organization in the Organiza-
            tions User Guide .

          o If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your  ac-
            count  limits  for  the  organization, contact Amazon Web Services
            Support .

          o If you get an exception that indicates that the  operation  failed
            because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and
            then try again. If the error persists, contact Amazon Web Services
            Support .

          o Using  CreateGovCloudAccount to create multiple temporary accounts
            isn't recommended. You can only close an account from  the  Amazon
            Web  Services Billing and Cost Management console, and you must be
            signed in as the root user. For information  on  the  requirements
            and  process  for closing an account, see Closing a member account
            in your organization in the Organizations User Guide .

       NOTE:
          When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose
          whether  to  create the account with the IAM User and Role Access to
          Billing Information switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users  and
          roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information
          for the account. If you disable it, only the account root  user  can
          access  billing  information.  For  information about how to disable
          this switch for an account, see Granting access to your billing  in-
          formation and tools .

OPTIONS
       --email (string)
          Specifies the email address of the owner to assign to the new member
          account in the commercial Region. This email address  must  not  al-
          ready  be  associated  with another Amazon Web Services account. You
          must use a valid email address to complete account creation.

          The rules for a valid email address:

          o The address must be a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 64  characters
            long.

          o All characters must be 7-bit ASCII characters.

          o There must be one and only one @ symbol, which separates the local
            name from the domain name.

          o The local name can't contain  any  of  the  following  characters:
            whitespace, " ' ( ) < > [ ] : ; , | % &

          o The local name can't begin with a dot (.)

          o The   domain   name   can   consist   of   only   the   characters
            [a-z],[A-Z],[0-9], hyphen (-), or dot (.)

          o The domain name can't begin or end with a hyphen (-) or dot (.)

          o The domain name must contain at least one dot

          You can't access the root user of the account or remove  an  account
          that was created with an invalid email address. Like all request pa-
          rameters for CreateGovCloudAccount , the request for the  email  ad-
          dress  for  the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account originates
          from the commercial Region, not from the Amazon  Web  Services  Gov-
          Cloud (US) Region.

       --account-name (string)
          The friendly name of the member account.

          The    account   name   can   consist   of   only   the   characters
          [a-z],[A-Z],[0-9], hyphen (-), or dot (.) You can't separate charac-
          ters with a dash ().

       --role-name (string)
          (Optional)

          The  name of an IAM role that Organizations automatically preconfig-
          ures in the new member accounts in both the Amazon Web Services Gov-
          Cloud (US) Region and in the commercial Region. This role trusts the
          management account, allowing users in the management account to  as-
          sume the role, as permitted by the management account administrator.
          The role has administrator permissions in the new member account.

          If you don't specify this parameter, the role name defaults to Orga-
          nizationAccountAccessRole .

          For more information about how to use this role to access the member
          account, see the following links:

          o Creating the OrganizationAccountAccessRole in  an  invited  member
            account in the Organizations User Guide

          o Steps  2  and 3 in IAM Tutorial: Delegate access across Amazon Web
            Services accounts using IAM roles in the IAM User Guide

          The regex pattern that is used to validate this parameter. The  pat-
          tern  can  include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits with
          no spaces, and any of the following characters: =,.@-

       --iam-user-access-to-billing (string)
          If set to ALLOW , the new linked account in  the  commercial  Region
          enables IAM users to access account billing information if they have
          the required permissions. If set to DENY , only the root user of the
          new  account can access account billing information. For more infor-
          mation, see About IAM access to the Billing and Cost Management con-
          sole  in  the  Amazon  Web Services Billing and Cost Management User
          Guide .

          If you don't specify this parameter, the value defaults to  ALLOW  ,
          and  IAM  users  and  roles with the required permissions can access
          billing information for the new account.

          Possible values:

          o ALLOW

          o DENY

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags that you want to attach to the newly created account.
          These  tags  are  attached to the commercial account associated with
          the GovCloud account, and not to the GovCloud account itself. To add
          tags to the actual GovCloud account, call the  TagResource operation
          in the GovCloud region after the new GovCloud account exists.

          For each tag in the list, you must specify both  a  tag  key  and  a
          value.  You  can set the value to an empty string, but you can't set
          it to null . For more information about tagging, see Tagging Organi-
          zations resources in the Organizations User Guide.

          NOTE:
              If any one of the tags is not valid or if you exceed the maximum
              allowed number of tags for an account, then the  entire  request
              fails and the account is not created.

          (structure)
              A  custom  key-value pair associated with a resource within your
              organization.

              You can attach tags to any of  the  following  organization  re-
              sources.

              o Amazon Web Services account

              o Organizational unit (OU)

              o Organization root

              o Policy

              Key -> (string)
                 The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  string  value that's associated with the key of the tag.
                 You can set the value of a tag to an empty  string,  but  you
                 can't set the value of a tag to null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,

              this  value  from the response of the initial  CreateAccount re-
              quest to create the account.

              The regex pattern for a create account  request  ID  string  re-
              quires "car-" followed by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or dig-
              its.

              The date and time that the account was created and  the  request
              completed.

          AccountId -> (string)
              If  the  account was created successfully, the unique identifier
              (ID) of the new account.

              The regex pattern for an account ID string requires  exactly  12
              digits.

          GovCloudAccountId -> (string)
              If  the  account was created successfully, the unique identifier

                that owns your organization failed to receive business license
                validation.

              o GOVCLOUD_ACCOUNT_ALREADY_EXISTS: The account in the Amazon Web
                Services GovCloud (US) Region could  not  be  created  because

                or Belarus. For more information, see Managing your Amazon Web
                Services payments .

              o INTERNAL_FAILURE: The account could not be created because  of
                an internal failure. Try again later. If the problem persists,
                contact Amazon Web Services Customer Support.

              o MISSING_BUSINESS_VALIDATION: The Amazon Web  Services  account
                that  owns your organization has not received Business Valida-
