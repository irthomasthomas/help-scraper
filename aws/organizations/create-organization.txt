CREATE-ORGANIZATION()                                    CREATE-ORGANIZATION()



NAME
       create-organization -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an Amazon Web Services organization. The account whose user is
       calling the  CreateOrganization  operation  automatically  becomes  the
       management account of the new organization.

       This  operation  must be called using credentials from the account that
       is to become the new organization's management account.  The  principal
       must also have the relevant IAM permissions.

       By  default  (or  if you set the FeatureSet parameter to ALL ), the new
       organization is created with all features enabled and  service  control
       policies  automatically  enabled  in the root. If you instead choose to
       create the organization supporting only the consolidated  billing  fea-
       tures  by setting the FeatureSet parameter to CONSOLIDATED_BILLING , no
       policy types are enabled by default  and  you  can't  use  organization
       policies.

OPTIONS
       --feature-set (string)
          Specifies  the  feature  set supported by the new organization. Each
          feature set supports different levels of functionality.

          o CONSOLIDATED_BILLING : All member accounts have their  bills  con-
            solidated to and paid by the management account. For more informa-
            tion, see Consolidated billing in the Organizations User  Guide  .
            The  consolidated billing feature subset isn't available for orga-
            nizations in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region.

          o ALL : In addition to all the features supported  by  the  consoli-
            dated  billing  feature set, the management account can also apply
            any policy type to any member account  in  the  organization.  For
            more information, see All features in the Organizations User Guide
            .

          Possible values:

          o ALL

          o CONSOLIDATED_BILLING

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create a new organization

       Bill wants to create an organization  using  credentials  from  account
       111111111111.  The following example shows that the account becomes the
       master account in the new organization. Because he does not  specify  a
       features set, the new organization defaults to all features enabled and
       service control policies are enabled on the root.

          aws organizations create-organization

       The output includes an organization object with details about  the  new
       organization:

          {
                  "Organization": {
                          "AvailablePolicyTypes": [
                                  {
                                          "Status": "ENABLED",
                                          "Type": "SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY"
                                  }
                          ],
                          "MasterAccountId": "111111111111",
                          "MasterAccountArn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:account/o-exampleorgid/111111111111",
                          "MasterAccountEmail": "bill@example.com",
                          "FeatureSet": "ALL",
                          "Id": "o-exampleorgid",
                          "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:organization/o-exampleorgid"
                  }
          }

       Example  2: To create a new organization with only consolidated billing
       features enabled

       The following example creates an organization that  supports  only  the
       consolidated billing features:

          aws organizations create-organization --feature-set CONSOLIDATED_BILLING

       The  output  includes an organization object with details about the new
       organization:

          {
                  "Organization": {
                          "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:organization/o-exampleorgid",
                          "AvailablePolicyTypes": [],
                          "Id": "o-exampleorgid",
                          "MasterAccountArn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:account/o-exampleorgid/111111111111",
                          "MasterAccountEmail": "bill@example.com",
                          "MasterAccountId": "111111111111",
                          "FeatureSet": "CONSOLIDATED_BILLING"
                  }
          }

                 plete information about the policies in your organization.

              To determine the policies that are enabled and available for use
              in your organization, use the  ListRoots operation instead.
