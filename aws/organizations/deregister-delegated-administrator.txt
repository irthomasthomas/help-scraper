SYNOPSIS
            deregister-delegated-administrator
          --account-id <value>
          --service-principal <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The account ID number of the member account in the organization that
          you want to deregister as a delegated administrator.

       --service-principal (string)
          The service principal name of an Amazon  Web  Services  service  for
          which the account is a delegated administrator.

          Delegated  administrator  privileges are revoked for only the speci-
          fied Amazon Web Services service from the  member  account.  If  the
          specified  service  is the only service for which the member account
          is a delegated administrator, the operation also  revokes  Organiza-
          tions read action permissions.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
