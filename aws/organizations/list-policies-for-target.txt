LIST-POLICIES-FOR-TARGET()                          LIST-POLICIES-FOR-TARGET()



NAME
       list-policies-for-target -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  policies that are directly attached to the specified target
       root, organizational unit (OU), or account. You must specify the policy
       type that you want included in the returned list.

       NOTE:
          Always  check the NextToken response parameter for a null value when
          calling a List* operation. These operations can occasionally  return
          an  empty set of results even when there are more results available.
          The NextToken response parameter value is null  only when there  are
          no more results to display.

       This  operation  can  be called only from the organization's management
       account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an
       Amazon Web Services service.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-policies-for-target  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: Policies

OPTIONS
       --target-id (string)
          The unique identifier (ID) of the root, organizational unit, or  ac-
          count whose policies you want to list.

          The regex pattern for a target ID string requires one of the follow-
          ing:

          o Root - A string that begins with "r-" followed by  from  4  to  32
            lowercase letters or digits.

          o Account - A string that consists of exactly 12 digits.

          o Organizational  unit  (OU)  - A string that begins with "ou-" fol-
            lowed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID  of  the
            root  that  the OU is in). This string is followed by a second "-"
            dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.

       --filter (string)
          The type of policy that you want to include in  the  returned  list.
          You must specify one of the following values:

          o SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY

          o RESOURCE_CONTROL_POLICY

          o BACKUP_POLICY

          o TAG_POLICY

          o CHATBOT_POLICY

          o AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY

          Possible values:

          o SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY

          o RESOURCE_CONTROL_POLICY

          o TAG_POLICY

          o BACKUP_POLICY

          o AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY

          o CHATBOT_POLICY

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve a list of the SCPs attached directly to an account

       The  following  example  shows how to get a list of all service control
       policies (SCPs), as specified by the Filter  parameter,  that  are  di-
       rectly attached to an account:

          aws organizations list-policies-for-target --filter SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY --target-id 444444444444

       The  output  includes a list of policy structures with summary informa-
       tion about the policies. The list does not include policies that  apply
       to  the account because of inheritance from its location in an OU hier-
       archy:

          {
                  "Policies": [
                          {
                                  "Type": "SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY",
                                  "Name": "AllowAllEC2Actions",
                                  "AwsManaged", false,
                                  "Id": "p-examplepolicyid222",
                                  "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::o-exampleorgid:policy/service_control_policy/p-examplepolicyid222",
                                  "Description": "Enables account admins to delegate permissions for any EC2 actions to users and roles in their accounts."
                          }
                  ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Policies -> (list)
          The list of policies that match the criteria in the request.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a policy, but does  not  include  the
              content. To see the content of a policy, see  DescribePolicy .

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier (ID) of the policy.

                 The  regex  pattern for a policy ID string requires "p-" fol-
                 lowed by from 8 to 128 lowercase or uppercase  letters,  dig-
                 its, or the underscore character (_).

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy.

                 For  more  information  about  ARNs in Organizations, see ARN
                 Formats Supported by Organizations in the Amazon Web Services
                 Service Authorization Reference .

              Name -> (string)
                 The friendly name of the policy.

                 The  regex pattern that is used to validate this parameter is
                 a string of any of the  characters  in  the  ASCII  character
                 range.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the policy.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of policy.

              AwsManaged -> (boolean)
                 A  boolean  value that indicates whether the specified policy
                 is an Amazon Web Services managed policy. If true,  then  you
                 can  attach  the  policy  to roots, OUs, or accounts, but you
                 cannot edit it.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If present, indicates that more output is available than is included
          in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken request pa-
          rameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the  next  part
          of  the  output. You should repeat this until the NextToken response
          element comes back as null .
