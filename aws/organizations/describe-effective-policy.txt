DESCRIBE-EFFECTIVE-POLICY()                        DESCRIBE-EFFECTIVE-POLICY()



NAME
       describe-effective-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the contents of the effective policy for specified policy type
       and account. The effective policy is the aggregation of any policies of
       the  specified  type that the account inherits, plus any policy of that
       type that is directly attached to the account.

       This operation applies only to policy types other than service  control
       policies (SCPs).

       For  more  information about policy inheritance, see How Policy Inheri-
       tance Works in the Organizations User Guide .

       This operation can be called only from  the  organization's  management
       account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an
       Amazon Web Services service.

OPTIONS
       --policy-type (string)
          The type of policy that you want information about. You can  specify
          one of the following values:

          o AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY

          o BACKUP_POLICY

          o TAG_POLICY

          Possible values:

          o TAG_POLICY

          o BACKUP_POLICY

          o AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY

       --target-id (string)
          When  you're  signed in as the management account, specify the ID of
          the account that you want details about. Specifying an  organization
          root or organizational unit (OU) as the target is not supported.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
