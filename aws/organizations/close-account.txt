CLOSE-ACCOUNT()                                                CLOSE-ACCOUNT()



NAME
       close-account -

DESCRIPTION
       Closes  an  Amazon  Web Services member account within an organization.
       You can't close the management account with this API. This is an  asyn-
       chronous  request  that Amazon Web Services performs in the background.
       Because CloseAccount operates asynchronously, it can return a  success-
       ful  completion  message  even though account closure might still be in
       progress. You need to wait a few minutes before the  account  is  fully
       closed. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:

       o Use  the  AccountId that you sent in the CloseAccount request to pro-
         vide as a parameter to the   DescribeAccount  operation.   While  the
         close  account  request  is in progress, Account status will indicate
         PENDING_CLOSURE. When the close account request completes, the status
         will change to SUSPENDED.

       o Check  the  CloudTrail log for the CloseAccountResult event that gets
         published after the account closes successfully. For  information  on
         using  CloudTrail  with  Organizations, see Logging and monitoring in
         Organizations in the Organizations User Guide.

       NOTE:

          o You can only close 10% of active member accounts within a  rolling
            30  day  period.  This quota is not bound by a calendar month, but
            starts when you close an account. Within 30 days of  that  initial
            account closure, you can't exceed the 10% account closure limit.

          o To reinstate a closed account, contact Amazon Web Services Support
            within the 90-day grace period while the account is  in  SUSPENDED
            status.

          o If  the Amazon Web Services account you attempt to close is linked
            to an Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account, the  CloseAccount
            request  will  close both accounts. To learn important pre-closure
            details, see Closing an Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US)  account
            in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide .

       For  more information about closing accounts, see Closing an Amazon Web
       Services account in the Organizations User Guide.

SYNOPSIS
            close-account
          --account-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          Retrieves the  Amazon  Web  Services  account  Id  for  the  current
          CloseAccount API request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
