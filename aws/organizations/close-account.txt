CLOSE-ACCOUNT()                                                CLOSE-ACCOUNT()



NAME
       close-account -

DESCRIPTION
       Closes  an  Amazon  Web Services member account within an organization.
       You can close an account when all features  are  enabled  .  You  can't
       close the management account with this API. This is an asynchronous re-
       quest that Amazon Web Services  performs  in  the  background.  Because
       CloseAccount  operates  asynchronously, it can return a successful com-
       pletion message even though account closure might still be in progress.
       You  need  to wait a few minutes before the account is fully closed. To
       check the status of the request, do one of the following:

       o Use the AccountId that you sent in the CloseAccount request  to  pro-
         vide  as  a  parameter  to the  DescribeAccount operation.  While the
         close account request is in progress, Account  status  will  indicate
         PENDING_CLOSURE. When the close account request completes, the status
         will change to SUSPENDED.

       o Check the CloudTrail log for the CloseAccountResult event  that  gets
         published  after  the account closes successfully. For information on
         using CloudTrail with Organizations, see Logging  and  monitoring  in
         Organizations in the Organizations User Guide .

       NOTE:

          o You  can  close  only 10% of member accounts, between 10 and 1000,
            within a rolling 30 day period. This quota is not bound by a  cal-
            endar month, but starts when you close an account. After you reach
            this limit, you can't close additional accounts. For more informa-
            tion, see Closing a member account in your organization and Quotas
            for Organizations in the Organizations User Guide .

          o To reinstate a closed account, contact Amazon Web Services Support
            within  the  90-day grace period while the account is in SUSPENDED
            status.

          o If the Amazon Web Services account you attempt to close is  linked
            to  an Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account, the CloseAccount
            request will close both accounts. To learn  important  pre-closure
            details,  see Closing an Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account
            in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          Retrieves the  Amazon  Web  Services  account  Id  for  the  current
          CloseAccount API request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.
