DISABLE-AWS-SERVICE-ACCESS()                      DISABLE-AWS-SERVICE-ACCESS()



NAME
       disable-aws-service-access -

DESCRIPTION
       Disables the integration of an Amazon Web Services service (the service
       that is specified by ServicePrincipal ) with  Organizations.  When  you
       disable  integration,  the  specified  service  no  longer can create a
       service-linked role in new accounts in your  organization.  This  means
       the service can't perform operations on your behalf on any new accounts
       in your organization. The service can still perform operations in older
       accounts until the service completes its clean-up from Organizations.

       WARNING:
          We  ** strongly recommend ** that you don't use this command to dis-
          able integration between Organizations and the specified Amazon  Web
          Services service. Instead, use the console or commands that are pro-
          vided by the specified service. This lets the trusted  service  per-
          form  any required initialization when enabling trusted access, such
          as creating any required resources and any required clean up of  re-
          sources when disabling trusted access.

          For  information about how to disable trusted service access to your
          organization using the trusted service, see the Learn more link  un-
          der  the  Supports Trusted Access column at Amazon Web Services ser-
          vices that you can use with Organizations . on this page.

          If you disable access by using this command, it causes the following
          actions to occur:

          o The  service can no longer create a service-linked role in the ac-
            counts in your organization. This means  that  the  service  can't
            perform  operations on your behalf on any new accounts in your or-
            ganization. The service can still perform operations in older  ac-
            counts  until  the  service  completes its clean-up from Organiza-
            tions.

          o The service can no longer perform tasks in the member accounts  in
            the organization, unless those operations are explicitly permitted
            by the IAM policies that are attached to your roles. This includes
            any  data  aggregation  from the member accounts to the management
            account, or to a delegated administrator account, where relevant.

          o Some services detect this and clean up any remaining data  or  re-
            sources  related to the integration, while other services stop ac-
            cessing the organization but leave any historical data and config-
            uration in place to support a possible re-enabling of the integra-
            tion.

          Using the other service's console or commands to disable  the  inte-
          gration ensures that the other service is aware that it can clean up
          any resources that are required only for the  integration.  How  the
          service  cleans  up its resources in the organization's accounts de-
          pends on that service. For more information, see  the  documentation
          for the other Amazon Web Services service.

       After  you perform the DisableAWSServiceAccess operation, the specified
       service can no longer perform operations  in  your  organization's  ac-
       counts

       For  more  information  about integrating other services with Organiza-
       tions, including the list of services that work with Organizations, see
       Integrating  Organizations  with  Other Amazon Web Services Services in
       the Organizations User Guide.

       This operation can be called only from  the  organization's  management
       account.

OPTIONS
       --service-principal (string)
          The  service  principal  name of the Amazon Web Services service for
          which you want to disable integration with your  organization.  This
          is  typically  in the form of a URL, such as `` service-abbreviation
          .amazonaws.com`` .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
