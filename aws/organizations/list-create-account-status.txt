LIST-CREATE-ACCOUNT-STATUS()                      LIST-CREATE-ACCOUNT-STATUS()



NAME
       list-create-account-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  account  creation  requests that match the specified status
       that is currently being tracked for the organization.

       NOTE:
          Always check the NextToken response parameter for a null value  when
          calling  a List* operation. These operations can occasionally return
          an empty set of results even when there are more results  available.
          The  NextToken response parameter value is null  only when there are
          no more results to display.

       This operation can be called only from  the  organization's  management
       account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an
       Amazon Web Services service.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-create-account-status is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: CreateAccountStatuses

SYNOPSIS
            list-create-account-status
          [--states <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --states (list)
          A list of one or more states that you want included in the response.
          If this parameter isn't present, all requests are  included  in  the
          response.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            IN_PROGRESS
            SUCCEEDED
            FAILED

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To retrieve a list of the account creation requests made  in
       the current organization

       The  following  example shows how to request a list of account creation
       requests for an organization that have completed successfully:

          aws organizations list-create-account-status --states SUCCEEDED

       The output includes an array of objects with information about each re-
       quest.

          {
                  "CreateAccountStatuses": [
                          {
                                  "AccountId": "444444444444",
                                  "AccountName": "Developer Test Account",
                                  "CompletedTimeStamp": 1481835812.143,
                                  "Id": "car-examplecreateaccountrequestid111",
                                  "RequestedTimeStamp": 1481829432.531,
                                  "State": "SUCCEEDED"
                          }
                  ]
          }

       Example  2:  To retrieve a list of the in progress account creation re-
       quests made in the current organization

       The following example gets a list of in-progress account  creation  re-
       quests for an organization:

          aws organizations list-create-account-status --states IN_PROGRESS

       The output includes an array of objects with information about each re-
       quest.

          {
                  "CreateAccountStatuses": [
                          {
                            "State": "IN_PROGRESS",
                            "Id": "car-examplecreateaccountrequestid111",
                            "RequestedTimeStamp": 1481829432.531,
                            "AccountName": "Production Account"
                          }
                  ]
          }

OUTPUT
       CreateAccountStatuses -> (list)
          A list of objects with details about the requests. Certain elements,
          such  as  the accountId number, are present in the output only after
          the account has been successfully created.

          (structure)
              Contains the status about a  CreateAccount or  CreateGovCloudAc-
              count  request  to  create  an Amazon Web Services account or an
              Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account in an organization.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier (ID) that references this request.  You
                 get  this  value  from the response of the initial  CreateAc-
                 count request to create the account.

                 The regex pattern for a create account request ID string  re-
                 quires  "car-"  followed by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or
                 digits.

              AccountName -> (string)
                 The account name given to the account when it was created.

              State -> (string)
                 The status of the asynchronous request to  create  an  Amazon
                 Web Services account.

              RequestedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and time that the request was made for the account
                 creation.

              CompletedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the account was created  and  the  re-
                 quest completed.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 If  the  account was created successfully, the unique identi-
                 fier (ID) of the new account.

                 The regex pattern for an account ID string  requires  exactly
                 12 digits.

              GovCloudAccountId -> (string)
                 If  the  account was created successfully, the unique identi-
                 fier (ID) of the new account in the Amazon Web Services  Gov-
                 Cloud (US) Region.

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 If  the  request  failed, a description of the reason for the
                 failure.

                   count that owns your organization has an unknown issue with
                   business license validation.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If present, indicates that more output is available than is included
          in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken request pa-
          rameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the  next  part
          of  the  output. You should repeat this until the NextToken response
          element comes back as null .
