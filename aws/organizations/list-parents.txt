LIST-PARENTS()                                                  LIST-PARENTS()



NAME
       list-parents -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the root or organizational units (OUs) that serve as the immedi-
       ate parent of the specified child OU or account. This operation,  along
       with   ListChildren  enables  you  to  traverse the tree structure that
       makes up this root.

       NOTE:
          Always check the NextToken response parameter for a null value  when
          calling  a List* operation. These operations can occasionally return
          an empty set of results even when there are more results  available.
          The  NextToken response parameter value is null  only when there are
          no more results to display.

       This operation can be called only from  the  organization's  management
       account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an
       Amazon Web Services service.

       NOTE:
          In the current release, a child can have only a single parent.

       list-parents is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: Parents

OPTIONS
       --child-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier  (ID) of the OU or account whose parent con-
          tainers you want to list. Don't specify a root.

          The regex pattern for a child ID string requires one of the  follow-
          ing:

          o Account - A string that consists of exactly 12 digits.

          o Organizational  unit  (OU)  - A string that begins with "ou-" fol-
            lowed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID  of  the
            root  that  contains  the OU). This string is followed by a second
            "-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the parent OUs or roots for an account or child OU

       The  following  example you how to list the root or parent OU that con-
       tains that account 444444444444:

          aws organizations list-parents --child-id 444444444444

       The output shows that the specified account is in the OU with specified
       ID:

          {
            "Parents": [
                  {
                    "Id": "ou-examplerootid111-exampleouid111",
                    "Type": "ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT"
                  }
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Parents -> (list)
          A list of parents for the specified child account or OU.

          (structure)
              Contains  information  about  either a root or an organizational
              unit (OU) that can contain OUs or accounts in an organization.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier (ID) of the parent entity.

                 The regex pattern for a parent ID string requires one of  the
                 following:

                 o Root - A string that begins with "r-" followed by from 4 to
                   32 lowercase letters or digits.

                 o Organizational unit (OU) - A string that begins with  "ou-"
                   followed  by  from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the
                   ID of the root that the OU is in). This string is  followed
                   by  a second "-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase
                   letters or digits.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of the parent entity.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If present, indicates that more output is available than is included
          in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken request pa-
          rameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the  next  part
          of  the  output. You should repeat this until the NextToken response
          element comes back as null .
