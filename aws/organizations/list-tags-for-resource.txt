NAME
       list-tags-for-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists tags that are attached to the specified resource.

       You can attach tags to the following resources in Organizations.

       o Amazon Web Services account

       o Organization root

       o Organizational unit (OU)

       o Policy (any type)

       This  operation  can  be called only from the organization's management
       account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an
       Amazon Web Services service.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-tags-for-resource is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Tags

OPTIONS
       --resource-id (string)
          The ID of the resource with the tags to list.

          You can specify any of the following taggable resources.

          o Amazon Web Services account  specify the account ID number.

          o Organizational unit  specify the OU ID that begins  with  ou-  and
            looks similar to:
            ``
            ou-1a2b-34uvwxyz ``

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 97)
            Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          o Root   specify  the  root ID that begins with r- and looks similar
            to:
            ``
            r-1a2b ``

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 99)
            Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          o Policy  specify the policy ID that begins with p- andlooks similar
            to:
            ``
            p-12abcdefg3 ``

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 101)
            Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       --ca-bundle (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       Tags -> (list)
          The tags that are assigned to the resource.

          (structure)
              A custom key-value pair associated with a resource  within  your
              organization.

              You  can  attach  tags  to any of the following organization re-
              sources.

              o Amazon Web Services account

              o Organizational unit (OU)

              o Organization root

              o Policy

              Key -> (string)
                 The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The string value that's associated with the key of  the  tag.
                 You  can  set  the value of a tag to an empty string, but you
                 can't set the value of a tag to null.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If present, indicates that more output is available than is included
          in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken request pa-
          rameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the  next  part
          of  the  output. You should repeat this until the NextToken response
          element comes back as null .
