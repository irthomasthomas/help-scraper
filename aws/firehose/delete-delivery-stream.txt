DELETE-DELIVERY-STREAM()                              DELETE-DELIVERY-STREAM()



NAME
       delete-delivery-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a delivery stream and its data.

       To  check the state of a delivery stream, use  DescribeDeliveryStream .
       You can delete a delivery stream only if it is in one of the  following
       states:  ACTIVE , DELETING , CREATING_FAILED , or DELETING_FAILED . You
       can't delete a delivery stream that is in the CREATING state. While the
       deletion  request is in process, the delivery stream is in the DELETING
       state.

       While the delivery stream is in the DELETING state, the  service  might
       continue to accept records, but it doesn't make any guarantees with re-
       spect to delivering the data. Therefore, as a best practice, first stop
       any  applications that are sending records before you delete a delivery
       stream.

OPTIONS
       --delivery-stream-name (string)
          The name of the delivery stream.

       --allow-force-delete | --no-allow-force-delete (boolean)
          Set this to true if you want to delete the delivery stream  even  if
          Kinesis Data Firehose is unable to retire the grant for the CMK. Ki-
          nesis Data Firehose might be unable to retire the  grant  due  to  a
          customer  error, such as when the CMK or the grant are in an invalid
          state. If you force deletion, you can then use the RevokeGrant oper-
          ation  to  revoke  the grant you gave to Kinesis Data Firehose. If a
          failure to retire the grant happens due to an AWS KMS issue, Kinesis
          Data Firehose keeps retrying the delete operation.

          The default value is false.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
