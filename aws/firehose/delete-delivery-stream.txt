DELETE-DELIVERY-STREAM()                              DELETE-DELIVERY-STREAM()



NAME
       delete-delivery-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a Firehose stream and its data.

       You  can delete a Firehose stream only if it is in one of the following
       states: ACTIVE , DELETING , CREATING_FAILED , or DELETING_FAILED .  You
       can't  delete a Firehose stream that is in the CREATING state. To check
       the state of a Firehose stream, use  DescribeDeliveryStream .

       DeleteDeliveryStream is an asynchronous API. When  an  API  request  to
       DeleteDeliveryStream  succeeds, the Firehose stream is marked for dele-
       tion, and it goes into the DELETING state.While the Firehose stream  is
       in  the  DELETING  state, the service might continue to accept records,
       but it doesn't make any guarantees with respect to delivering the data.
       Therefore,  as  a  best  practice, first stop any applications that are
       sending records before you delete a Firehose stream.

       Removal of a Firehose stream that is in the DELETING  state  is  a  low
       priority operation for the service. A stream may remain in the DELETING
       state for several minutes. Therefore, as a best practice,  applications
       should not wait for streams in the DELETING state to be removed.

OPTIONS
       --delivery-stream-name (string)
          The name of the Firehose stream.

       --allow-force-delete | --no-allow-force-delete (boolean)
          Set  this  to true if you want to delete the Firehose stream even if
          Firehose is unable to retire the grant for the CMK.  Firehose  might
          be  unable to retire the grant due to a customer error, such as when
          the CMK or the grant are in an invalid state. If you force deletion,
          you  can  then use the RevokeGrant operation to revoke the grant you
          gave to Firehose. If a failure to retire the grant happens due to an
          Amazon  Web  Services  KMS issue, Firehose keeps retrying the delete
          operation.

          The default value is false.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       None
