UPDATE-DESTINATION()                                      UPDATE-DESTINATION()



NAME
       update-destination -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the specified destination of the specified delivery stream.

       Use  this operation to change the destination type (for example, to re-
       place the Amazon S3 destination with Amazon Redshift) or change the pa-
       rameters  associated  with  a  destination  (for example, to change the
       bucket name of the Amazon S3 destination). The update might  not  occur
       immediately.  The  target delivery stream remains active while the con-
       figurations are updated, so data writes to the delivery stream can con-
       tinue  during  this process. The updated configurations are usually ef-
       fective within a few minutes.

       Switching between Amazon ES and other services is not supported. For an
       Amazon  ES destination, you can only update to another Amazon ES desti-
       nation.

       If the destination type is the same, Kinesis Data Firehose  merges  the
       configuration  parameters  specified with the destination configuration
       that already exists on the delivery stream. If any  of  the  parameters
       are  not  specified  in the call, the existing values are retained. For
       example, in the Amazon S3 destination, if   EncryptionConfiguration  is
       not  specified, then the existing EncryptionConfiguration is maintained
       on the destination.

       If the destination type is not the same, for example, changing the des-
       tination  from Amazon S3 to Amazon Redshift, Kinesis Data Firehose does
       not merge any parameters. In this case, all parameters must  be  speci-
       fied.

       Kinesis Data Firehose uses CurrentDeliveryStreamVersionId to avoid race
       conditions and conflicting merges. This is a required  field,  and  the
       service  updates  the  configuration only if the existing configuration
       has a version ID that matches. After the  update  is  applied  success-
       fully,  the  version  ID  is  updated,  and can be retrieved using  De-
       scribeDeliveryStream . Use the new version ID to set  CurrentDeliveryS-
       treamVersionId in the next call.

OPTIONS
       --delivery-stream-name (string)
          The name of the delivery stream.

       --current-delivery-stream-version-id (string)
          Obtain  this  value  from the VersionId result of  DeliveryStreamDe-
          scription . This value is required, and helps  the  service  perform
          conditional operations. For example, if there is an interleaving up-
          date and this value is null, then the update destination fails.  Af-
          ter  the  update  is successful, the VersionId value is updated. The
          service then performs a merge of the old configuration with the  new
          configuration.

       --destination-id (string)
          The ID of the destination.

       --s3-destination-update (structure)
          [Deprecated] Describes an update for a destination in Amazon S3.

          RoleARN -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services cre-
              dentials. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)
              and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces .

          BucketARN -> (string)
              The  ARN  of the S3 bucket. For more information, see Amazon Re-
              source Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces .

          Prefix -> (string)
              The "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automatically used for
              delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom prefix,
              as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects .

          ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
              A prefix that Kinesis Data Firehose evaluates and adds to failed
              records  before  writing them to S3. This prefix appears immedi-
              ately following the bucket name. For information  about  how  to
              specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects .

          BufferingHints -> (structure)
              The  buffering  option. If no value is specified, BufferingHints
              object default values are used.

              SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                 Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in  MiBs,  before
                 delivering  it  to  the  destination. The default value is 5.
                 This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it,
                 you  must  also  specify  a value for IntervalInSeconds , and
                 vice versa.

                 We recommend setting this parameter to a value  greater  than
                 the  amount  of  data  you typically ingest into the delivery
                 stream in 10 seconds. For example, if  you  typically  ingest
                 data at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher.

              IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                 Buffer  incoming  data  for  the specified period of time, in
                 seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The default
                 value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you specify a
                 value for it, you must also specify a value for  SizeInMBs  ,
                 and vice versa.

              The compression format. If no value is specified, the default is
              UNCOMPRESSED .

              The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot  be  specified  for
              Amazon  Redshift  destinations because they are not supported by
              the Amazon Redshift  COPY  operation  that  reads  from  the  S3
              bucket.

          EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  encryption configuration. If no value is specified, the de-
              fault is no encryption.

                 Specifically override existing encryption information to  en-
                 sure that no encryption is used.

              KMSEncryptionConfig -> (structure)
                 The encryption key.

                 LogGroupName -> (string)
                     The CloudWatch group name for logging. This value is  re-
                     quired if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

                 LogStreamName -> (string)
                     The CloudWatch log stream name for logging. This value is
                     required if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

          DataFormatConversionConfiguration -> (structure)
              The serializer, deserializer, and  schema  for  converting  data
              from the JSON format to the Parquet or ORC format before writing
              it to Amazon S3.

              SchemaConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Specifies the Amazon Web Services  Glue  Data  Catalog  table
                 that  contains  the column information. This parameter is re-
                 quired if Enabled is set to true.

                 RoleARN -> (string)
                     The role that Kinesis Data Firehose  can  use  to  access
                     Amazon  Web  Services Glue. This role must be in the same
                     account you use for Kinesis Data Firehose.  Cross-account
                     roles aren't allowed.

                     WARNING:
                        If  the  SchemaConfiguration request parameter is used
                        as part of invoking the CreateDeliveryStream API, then
                        the RoleARN property is required and its value must be
                        specified.

                 CatalogId -> (string)
                     The ID of the Amazon Web Services Glue Data  Catalog.  If
                     you don't supply this, the Amazon Web Services account ID
                     is used by default.

                 DatabaseName -> (string)
                     Specifies the name of the Amazon Web Services Glue  data-
                     base that contains the schema for the output data.

                     WARNING:
                        If  the  SchemaConfiguration request parameter is used
                        as part of invoking the CreateDeliveryStream API, then
                        the  DatabaseName  property  is required and its value
                        must be specified.

                 TableName -> (string)
                     Specifies the Amazon Web Services Glue  table  that  con-
                     tains  the  column information that constitutes your data
                     schema.

                     WARNING:
                        If the SchemaConfiguration request parameter  is  used
                        as part of invoking the CreateDeliveryStream API, then
                        the TableName property is required and its value  must
                        be specified.

                 Region -> (string)
                     If  you  don't specify an Amazon Web Services Region, the
                     default is the current Region.

                 VersionId -> (string)
                     Specifies the table version for the output  data  schema.
                     If you don't specify this version ID, or if you set it to
                     LATEST , Kinesis Data Firehose uses the most recent  ver-
                     sion.  This means that any updates to the table are auto-
                     matically picked up.

              InputFormatConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Specifies the deserializer that you want Kinesis  Data  Fire-
                 hose  to  use  to  convert the format of your data from JSON.
                 This parameter is required if Enabled is set to true.

                 Deserializer -> (structure)
                     Specifies which deserializer to use. You can  choose  ei-
                     ther  the Apache Hive JSON SerDe or the OpenX JSON SerDe.
                     If both are non-null, the server rejects the request.

                     OpenXJsonSerDe -> (structure)
                        The OpenX SerDe. Used by Kinesis Data Firehose for de-
                        serializing  data,  which means converting it from the
                        JSON format in preparation for serializing it  to  the
                        Parquet  or ORC format. This is one of two deserializ-
                        ers you can choose, depending on which one offers  the
                        functionality you need. The other option is the native
                        Hive / HCatalog JsonSerDe.

                        ConvertDotsInJsonKeysToUnderscores -> (boolean)
                            When set to true , specifies that the names of the
                            keys  include  dots and that you want Kinesis Data
                            Firehose to replace them with underscores. This is
                            useful  because Apache Hive does not allow dots in
                            column names. For example, if the JSON contains  a
                            key whose name is "a.b", you can define the column
                            name to be "a_b" when using this option.

                            The default is false .

                        CaseInsensitive -> (boolean)
                            When set to true , which is the  default,  Kinesis
                            Data  Firehose converts JSON keys to lowercase be-
                            fore deserializing them.

                        ColumnToJsonKeyMappings -> (map)
                            Maps column names to JSON keys that aren't identi-
                            cal  to  the column names. This is useful when the
                            JSON contains keys that are Hive keywords. For ex-
                            ample,  timestamp is a Hive keyword. If you have a
                            JSON key named timestamp , set this  parameter  to
                            {"ts":  "timestamp"}  to  map this key to a column
                            named ts .

                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (string)

                     HiveJsonSerDe -> (structure)
                        The native Hive / HCatalog JsonSerDe. Used by  Kinesis
                        Data Firehose for deserializing data, which means con-
                        verting it from the JSON format in preparation for se-
                        rializing it to the Parquet or ORC format. This is one
                        of two deserializers  you  can  choose,  depending  on
                        which one offers the functionality you need. The other
                        option is the OpenX SerDe.

                        TimestampFormats -> (list)
                            Indicates how you want Kinesis  Data  Firehose  to
                            parse  the date and timestamps that may be present
                            in your input data JSON. To specify  these  format
                            strings,  follow  the pattern syntax of JodaTime's
                            DateTimeFormat format strings. For  more  informa-
                            tion,  see Class DateTimeFormat . You can also use
                            the special value millis to  parse  timestamps  in
                            epoch milliseconds. If you don't specify a format,
                            Kinesis   Data   Firehose   uses    java.sql.Time-
                            stamp::valueOf by default.

                            (string)

              OutputFormatConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the serializer that you want Kinesis Data Firehose
                 to use to convert the format of your data to the  Parquet  or
                 ORC  format.  This parameter is required if Enabled is set to
                 true.

                 Serializer -> (structure)
                     Specifies which serializer to use. You can choose  either
                     the ORC SerDe or the Parquet SerDe. If both are non-null,
                     the server rejects the request.

                     ParquetSerDe -> (structure)
                        A serializer to use for converting data to the Parquet
                        format before storing it in Amazon S3. For more infor-
                        mation, see Apache Parquet .

                        BlockSizeBytes -> (integer)
                            The Hadoop Distributed File  System  (HDFS)  block
                            size.  This  is  useful  if you intend to copy the
                            data from Amazon S3 to HDFS before  querying.  The
                            default  is 256 MiB and the minimum is 64 MiB. Ki-
                            nesis Data Firehose uses this  value  for  padding
                            calculations.

                        PageSizeBytes -> (integer)
                            The  Parquet  page size. Column chunks are divided
                            into pages. A page is conceptually an  indivisible
                            unit  (in  terms of compression and encoding). The
                            minimum value is 64 KiB and the default is 1 MiB.

                        Compression -> (string)
                            The compression code to use over data blocks.  The
                            possible  values  are  UNCOMPRESSED , SNAPPY , and
                            GZIP , with the default being SNAPPY . Use  SNAPPY
                            for  higher  decompression  speed. Use GZIP if the
                            compression ratio is more important than speed.

                        EnableDictionaryCompression -> (boolean)
                            Indicates whether to  enable  dictionary  compres-
                            sion.

                        MaxPaddingBytes -> (integer)
                            The  maximum  amount  of padding to apply. This is
                            useful if you intend to copy the data from  Amazon
                            S3 to HDFS before querying. The default is 0.

                        WriterVersion -> (string)
                            Indicates the version of row format to output. The
                            possible values are V1 and V2 . The default is  V1
                            .

                     OrcSerDe -> (structure)
                        A  serializer  to  use  for converting data to the ORC
                        format before storing it in Amazon S3. For more infor-
                        mation, see Apache ORC .

                        StripeSizeBytes -> (integer)
                            The number of bytes in each stripe. The default is
                            64 MiB and the minimum is 8 MiB.

                        BlockSizeBytes -> (integer)
                            The Hadoop Distributed File  System  (HDFS)  block
                            size.  This  is  useful  if you intend to copy the
                            data from Amazon S3 to HDFS before  querying.  The
                            default  is 256 MiB and the minimum is 64 MiB. Ki-
                            nesis Data Firehose uses this  value  for  padding
                            calculations.

                        RowIndexStride -> (integer)
                            The  number of rows between index entries. The de-
                            fault is 10,000 and the minimum is 1,000.

                        EnablePadding -> (boolean)
                            Set this to true to indicate that you want stripes
                            to be padded to the HDFS block boundaries. This is
                            useful if you intend to copy the data from  Amazon
                            S3 to HDFS before querying. The default is false .

                        PaddingTolerance -> (double)
                            A  number  between 0 and 1 that defines the toler-
                            ance for block padding as a  decimal  fraction  of
                            stripe  size.  The  default  value  is 0.05, which
                            means 5 percent of stripe size.

                            For the default values of 64 MiB ORC  stripes  and
                            256  MiB  HDFS  blocks,  the default block padding
                            tolerance of 5 percent reserves a maximum  of  3.2
                            MiB  for padding within the 256 MiB block. In such
                            a case, if the available size within the block  is
                            more  than  3.2  MiB, a new, smaller stripe is in-
                            serted to fit within that space. This ensures that
                            no  stripe crosses block boundaries and causes re-
                            mote reads within a node-local task.

                            Kinesis Data Firehose ignores this parameter  when
                            OrcSerDe$EnablePadding is false .

                        Compression -> (string)
                            The  compression code to use over data blocks. The
                            default is SNAPPY .

                        BloomFilterColumns -> (list)
                            The column names for which you want  Kinesis  Data
                            Firehose  to  create bloom filters. The default is
                            null .

                            (string)

                        BloomFilterFalsePositiveProbability -> (double)
                            The Bloom filter false positive probability (FPP).
                            The  lower  the  FPP, the bigger the Bloom filter.
                            The default value is 0.05, the minimum is  0,  and
                            the maximum is 1.

                        DictionaryKeyThreshold -> (double)
                            Represents  the  fraction  of  the total number of
                            non-null rows. To turn  off  dictionary  encoding,
                            set  this  fraction  to a number that is less than
                            the number of distinct keys in  a  dictionary.  To
                            always use dictionary encoding, set this threshold
                            to 1.

                        FormatVersion -> (string)
                            The version of the file  to  write.  The  possible
                            values  are V0_11 and V0_12 . The default is V0_12

                 section of Amazon Redshift COPY command . Some possible exam-
                 ples  that  would  apply to Kinesis Data Firehose are as fol-
                 lows:
                     delimiter '\t' lzop; - fields are delimited with "t" (TAB
                     character) and compressed using lzop.

                     delimiter  '|'  -  fields are delimited with "|" (this is
                     the default delimiter).

                     delimiter '|' escape - the delimiter should be escaped.

          Password -> (string)
              The user password.

          RetryOptions -> (structure)
              The  retry  behavior  in case Kinesis Data Firehose is unable to
              deliver documents to Amazon Redshift. Default value is 3600  (60
              minutes).

              DurationInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The length of time during which Kinesis Data Firehose retries
                 delivery after a failure, starting from the  initial  request
                 and  including  the  first attempt. The default value is 3600
                 seconds (60 minutes). Kinesis Data Firehose does not retry if
                 the  value  of  DurationInSeconds is 0 (zero) or if the first
                 delivery attempt takes longer than the current value.

          S3Update -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 destination.

              The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP  cannot  be  specified  in
              RedshiftDestinationUpdate.S3Update  because  the Amazon Redshift
              COPY operation that reads from the  S3  bucket  doesn't  support
              these compression formats.

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services
                 credentials. For more information, see Amazon Resource  Names
                 (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces .

              BucketARN -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  the S3 bucket. For more information, see Amazon
                 Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services  Service  Name-
                 spaces .

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The  "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automatically used
                 for delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a  custom
                 prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects
                 .

              ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
                 A prefix that Kinesis Data Firehose  evaluates  and  adds  to
                 failed records before writing them to S3. This prefix appears
                 immediately following the bucket name. For information  about
                 how to specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3
                 Objects .

              BufferingHints -> (structure)
                 The buffering option. If no value is  specified,  BufferingH-
                 ints object default values are used.

                 SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                     Buffer  incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs, be-
                     fore delivering it to the destination. The default  value
                     is  5.  This  parameter  is optional but if you specify a
                     value for it, you must also specify a  value  for  Inter-
                     valInSeconds , and vice versa.

                     We  recommend  setting  this parameter to a value greater
                     than the amount of data you typically ingest into the de-
                     livery  stream  in  10 seconds. For example, if you typi-
                     cally ingest data at 1 MiB/sec, the value  should  be  10
                     MiB or higher.

                 IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                     Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in
                     seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The de-
                     fault value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you
                     specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for
                     SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

              CompressionFormat -> (string)
                 The compression format. If no value is specified, the default
                 is UNCOMPRESSED .

                 The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for
                 Amazon  Redshift  destinations because they are not supported
                 by the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the  S3
                 bucket.

              EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  encryption  configuration. If no value is specified, the
                 default is no encryption.

                        Must belong to the same Amazon Web Services Region  as
                        the  destination  Amazon  S3 bucket. For more informa-
                        tion, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon  Web
                        Services Service Namespaces .

                 Objects .

              BufferingHints -> (structure)
                 The  buffering  option. If no value is specified, BufferingH-
                 ints object default values are used.

                 SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                     Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs,  be-
                     fore  delivering it to the destination. The default value
                     is 5. This parameter is optional but  if  you  specify  a
                     value  for  it,  you must also specify a value for Inter-
                     valInSeconds , and vice versa.

                     We recommend setting this parameter to  a  value  greater
                     than the amount of data you typically ingest into the de-
                     livery stream in 10 seconds. For example,  if  you  typi-
                     cally  ingest  data  at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10
                     MiB or higher.

                 IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                     Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in
                     seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The de-
                     fault value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you
                     specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for
                     SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

              CompressionFormat -> (string)
                 The compression format. If no value is specified, the default
                 is UNCOMPRESSED .

                 The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for
                 Amazon Redshift destinations because they are  not  supported
                 by  the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3
                 bucket.

       --elasticsearch-destination-update (structure)
          Describes an update for a destination in Amazon ES.

          RoleARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to be assumed  by
              Kinesis  Data  Firehose  for calling the Amazon ES Configuration
              API and for indexing documents. For more information, see  Grant
              Kinesis  Data  Firehose  Access  to an Amazon S3 Destination and
              Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and  Amazon  Web  Services  Service
              Namespaces .

          DomainARN -> (string)
              The  ARN of the Amazon ES domain. The IAM role must have permis-
              sions for DescribeDomain , DescribeDomains , and DescribeDomain-
              Config  after  assuming  the IAM role specified in RoleARN . For
              more information, see Amazon Resource Names  (ARNs)  and  Amazon
              Web Services Service Namespaces .

              Specify either ClusterEndpoint or DomainARN .

          ClusterEndpoint -> (string)
              The endpoint to use when communicating with the cluster. Specify
              either this ClusterEndpoint or the DomainARN field.

          IndexName -> (string)
              The Elasticsearch index name.

          TypeName -> (string)
              The Elasticsearch type name. For Elasticsearch 6.x, there can be
              only one type per index. If you try to specify a new type for an
              existing index that already has another type, Kinesis Data Fire-
              hose returns an error during runtime.

              If  you  upgrade  Elasticsearch  from 6.x to 7.x and dont update
              your delivery stream, Kinesis Data Firehose still delivers  data
              to  Elasticsearch  with the old index name and type name. If you
              want to update your delivery stream with a new index name,  pro-
              vide an empty string for TypeName .

          IndexRotationPeriod -> (string)
              The  Elasticsearch index rotation period. Index rotation appends
              a timestamp to IndexName to facilitate  the  expiration  of  old
              data. For more information, see Index Rotation for the Amazon ES
              Destination . Default value is OneDay .

          BufferingHints -> (structure)
              The buffering options. If no value is specified,  Elasticsearch-
              BufferingHints object default values are used.

              IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                 Buffer  incoming  data  for  the specified period of time, in
                 seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The default
                 value is 300 (5 minutes).

              SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                 Buffer  incoming  data  to the specified size, in MBs, before
                 delivering it to the destination. The default value is 5.

                 We recommend setting this parameter to a value  greater  than
                 the  amount  of  data  you typically ingest into the delivery
                 stream in 10 seconds. For example, if  you  typically  ingest
                 data at 1 MB/sec, the value should be 10 MB or higher.

          RetryOptions -> (structure)
              The  retry  behavior  in case Kinesis Data Firehose is unable to
              deliver documents to Amazon ES. The default value is 300 (5 min-
              utes).

              DurationInSeconds -> (integer)
                 After  an  initial failure to deliver to Amazon ES, the total
                 amount of time during which Kinesis Data Firehose retries de-
                 livery  (including  the  first  attempt). After this time has
                 elapsed, the failed documents are written to Amazon  S3.  De-
                 fault  value  is 300 seconds (5 minutes). A value of 0 (zero)
                 results in no retries.

          S3Update -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 destination.

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  Amazon  Web  Services
                 credentials.  For more information, see Amazon Resource Names
                 (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces .

              BucketARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of the S3 bucket. For more  information,  see  Amazon
                 Resource  Names  (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Name-
                 spaces .

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automatically  used
                 for  delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom
                 prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects
                 .

              ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
                 A  prefix  that  Kinesis  Data Firehose evaluates and adds to
                 failed records before writing them to S3. This prefix appears
                 immediately  following the bucket name. For information about
                 how to specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3
                 Objects .

              BufferingHints -> (structure)
                 The  buffering  option. If no value is specified, BufferingH-
                 ints object default values are used.

                     Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs,  be-
                     fore  delivering it to the destination. The default value
                     is 5. This parameter is optional but  if  you  specify  a
                     value  for  it,  you must also specify a value for Inter-
                     valInSeconds , and vice versa.

                     We recommend setting this parameter to  a  value  greater
                     than the amount of data you typically ingest into the de-
                     livery stream in 10 seconds. For example,  if  you  typi-
                     cally  ingest  data  at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10
                     MiB or higher.

                 IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                     Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in
                     seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The de-
                     fault value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you
                     specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for

                 The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for
                 Amazon Redshift destinations because they are  not  supported
                 by  the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3
                 bucket.

              EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)

       --amazonopensearchservice-destination-update (structure)
          Describes an update for a destination in Amazon OpenSearch Service.

          RoleARN -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to be assumed by
              Kinesis Data Firehose for calling the Amazon OpenSearch  Service
              Configuration API and for indexing documents.

          DomainARN -> (string)
              The  ARN  of  the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain. The IAM role
              must have permissions for DescribeDomain,  DescribeDomains,  and
              DescribeDomainConfig  after  assuming  the IAM role specified in
              RoleARN.

          ClusterEndpoint -> (string)
              The endpoint to use when communicating with the cluster. Specify
              either this ClusterEndpoint or the DomainARN field.

          IndexName -> (string)
              The Amazon OpenSearch Service index name.

          TypeName -> (string)
              The  Amazon OpenSearch Service type name. For Elasticsearch 6.x,
              there can be only one type per index. If you try  to  specify  a
              new  type  for  an existing index that already has another type,
              Kinesis Data Firehose returns an error during runtime.

              If you upgrade Elasticsearch from 6.x to  7.x  and  dont  update
              your  delivery stream, Kinesis Data Firehose still delivers data
              to Elasticsearch with the old index name and type name.  If  you
              want  to update your delivery stream with a new index name, pro-
              vide an empty string for TypeName.

          IndexRotationPeriod -> (string)
              The Amazon OpenSearch Service index rotation period. Index rota-
              tion  appends a timestamp to IndexName to facilitate the expira-
              tion of old data.

          BufferingHints -> (structure)
              The  buffering  options.  If  no  value   is   specified,   Ama-
              zonopensearchBufferingHints object default values are used.

              IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                 Buffer  incoming  data  for  the specified period of time, in
                 seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The default
                 value is 300 (5 minutes).

              SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                 Buffer  incoming  data  to the specified size, in MBs, before
                 delivering it to the destination. The default value is 5.

                 We recommend setting this parameter to a value  greater  than
                 the  amount  of  data  you typically ingest into the delivery
                 stream in 10 seconds. For example, if  you  typically  ingest
                 data at 1 MB/sec, the value should be 10 MB or higher.

          RetryOptions -> (structure)
              The  retry  behavior  in case Kinesis Data Firehose is unable to
              deliver documents to  Amazon  OpenSearch  Service.  The  default
              value is 300 (5 minutes).

              DurationInSeconds -> (integer)
                 After an initial failure to deliver to Amazon OpenSearch Ser-
                 vice, the total amount of  time  during  which  Kinesis  Data
                 Firehose  retries delivery (including the first attempt). Af-
                 ter this time has elapsed, the failed documents  are  written
                 to  Amazon  S3.  Default  value is 300 seconds (5 minutes). A
                 value of 0 (zero) results in no retries.

          S3Update -> (structure)
              Describes an update for a destination in Amazon S3.

              RoleARN -> (string)

                 spaces .

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automatically  used
                 for  delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom
                 prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects
                 .

              ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
                 A  prefix  that  Kinesis  Data Firehose evaluates and adds to
                 failed records before writing them to S3. This prefix appears
                 immediately  following the bucket name. For information about
                 how to specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3
                 Objects .

              BufferingHints -> (structure)
                 The  buffering  option. If no value is specified, BufferingH-
                 ints object default values are used.

                     Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs,  be-
                     fore  delivering it to the destination. The default value
                     is 5. This parameter is optional but  if  you  specify  a
                     value  for  it,  you must also specify a value for Inter-
                     valInSeconds , and vice versa.

                     We recommend setting this parameter to  a  value  greater
                     than the amount of data you typically ingest into the de-
                     livery stream in 10 seconds. For example,  if  you  typi-
                     cally  ingest  data  at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10
                     MiB or higher.

                 IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                     Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in
                     seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The de-
                     fault value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you
                     specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for
                     SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

              CompressionFormat -> (string)
                 The compression format. If no value is specified, the default
                 is UNCOMPRESSED .

                 The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for
                 Amazon Redshift destinations because they are  not  supported
                 by  the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3
                 bucket.

              EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The encryption configuration. If no value is  specified,  the

                 during  which  Kinesis Data Firehose waits for acknowledgment
                 from Splunk after each attempt.

          S3BackupMode -> (string)
              Specifies how you want Kinesis Data Firehose to  back  up  docu-
              ments  to  Amazon  S3. When set to FailedDocumentsOnly , Kinesis
              Data Firehose writes any data that could not be indexed  to  the
              configured  Amazon S3 destination. When set to AllEvents , Kine-
              sis Data Firehose delivers all incoming records  to  Amazon  S3,
              and also writes failed documents to Amazon S3. The default value
              is FailedEventsOnly .

              You can update this backup mode  from  FailedEventsOnly  to  Al-
              lEvents . You can't update it from AllEvents to FailedEventsOnly
              .

              BucketARN -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  the S3 bucket. For more information, see Amazon
                 Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services  Service  Name-
                 spaces .

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The  "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automatically used
                 for delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a  custom
                 prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects
                 .

              ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
                 A prefix that Kinesis Data Firehose  evaluates  and  adds  to
                 failed records before writing them to S3. This prefix appears
                 immediately following the bucket name. For information  about
                 how to specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3
                 Objects .

              BufferingHints -> (structure)

                     Buffer  incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs, be-
                     fore delivering it to the destination. The default  value
                     is  5.  This  parameter  is optional but if you specify a
                     value for it, you must also specify a  value  for  Inter-
                     valInSeconds , and vice versa.

                 failed records before writing them to S3. This prefix appears
                 immediately  following the bucket name. For information about
                 how to specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3
                 Objects .

              BufferingHints -> (structure)
                 The  buffering  option. If no value is specified, BufferingH-

                     Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs,  be-
                     fore  delivering it to the destination. The default value
                     is 5. This parameter is optional but  if  you  specify  a
                     value  for  it,  you must also specify a value for Inter-
                     valInSeconds , and vice versa.

                     We recommend setting this parameter to  a  value  greater
                     than the amount of data you typically ingest into the de-
                     livery stream in 10 seconds. For example,  if  you  typi-
                     cally  ingest  data  at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10
                     MiB or higher.

                     Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in
                     seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The de-
                     fault value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you
                     specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for
                     SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
