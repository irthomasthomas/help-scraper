LIST-DELIVERY-STREAMS()                                LIST-DELIVERY-STREAMS()



NAME
       list-delivery-streams -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists your delivery streams in alphabetical order of their names.

       The  number  of  delivery  streams might be too large to return using a
       single call to ListDeliveryStreams . You can limit the number of deliv-
       ery  streams  returned, using the Limit parameter. To determine whether
       there are more delivery streams to list, check the value of  HasMoreDe-
       liveryStreams  in  the  output.  If  there are more delivery streams to
       list, you can request them by calling this operation again and  setting
       the  ExclusiveStartDeliveryStreamName parameter to the name of the last
       delivery stream returned in the last call.

OPTIONS
       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of delivery streams to list. The default value is
          10.

       --delivery-stream-type (string)
          The delivery stream type. This can be one of the following values:

          o DirectPut  :  Provider applications access the delivery stream di-
            rectly.

          o KinesisStreamAsSource : The delivery stream uses  a  Kinesis  data
            stream as a source.

          This  parameter  is optional. If this parameter is omitted, delivery
          streams of all types are returned.

          Possible values:

          o DirectPut

          o KinesisStreamAsSource

          o MSKAsSource

       --exclusive-start-delivery-stream-name (string)
          The list of delivery streams returned by this call to ListDeliveryS-
          treams  will  start with the delivery stream whose name comes alpha-
          betically immediately after the name you specify in  ExclusiveStart-
          DeliveryStreamName .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the available delivery streams

       The  following list-delivery-streams example lists the available deliv-
       ery streams in your AWS account.

          aws firehose list-delivery-streams

       Output:

          {
              "DeliveryStreamNames": [
                  "my-stream"
              ],
              "HasMoreDeliveryStreams": false
          }

       For more information, see Creating an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose  De-
       livery Stream in the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Developer Guide.

       DeliveryStreamNames -> (list)
          The names of the delivery streams.

          (string)

       HasMoreDeliveryStreams -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether there are more delivery streams available to list.
