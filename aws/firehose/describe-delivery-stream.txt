DESCRIBE-DELIVERY-STREAM()                          DESCRIBE-DELIVERY-STREAM()



NAME
       describe-delivery-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  specified  Firehose stream and its status. For example,
       after your Firehose stream is created, call  DescribeDeliveryStream  to
       see  whether the Firehose stream is ACTIVE and therefore ready for data
       to be sent to it.

       If the status of a Firehose stream is  CREATING_FAILED  ,  this  status
       doesn't change, and you can't invoke  CreateDeliveryStream again on it.
       However, you can invoke the  DeleteDeliveryStream operation  to  delete
       it. If the status is DELETING_FAILED , you can force deletion by invok-
       ing  DeleteDeliveryStream again but with  DeleteDeliveryStreamInput$Al-
       lowForceDelete set to true.

OPTIONS
       --delivery-stream-name (string)
          The name of the Firehose stream.

       --limit (integer)
          The  limit on the number of destinations to return. You can have one
          destination per Firehose stream.

       --exclusive-start-destination-id (string)
          The ID of the destination to start returning the destination  infor-
          mation. Firehose supports one destination per Firehose stream.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

                data stream as a source.

          VersionId -> (string)
              Each  time the destination is updated for a Firehose stream, the
              version ID is changed, and the current version  ID  is  required
              when updating the destination. This is so that the service knows

                     By default, this is set to timestamp  when  Firehose  be-
                     comes Active.

                     If  you  want  to  create a Firehose stream with Earliest
                     start position from SDK or CLI, you need to set the Read-
                     FromTimestampUTC         parameter        to        Epoch
                     (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).

                            The  ARN  of  the S3 bucket. For more information,
                            see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)  and  Amazon  Web
                            Services Service Namespaces .

                        Prefix -> (string)
                            The "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automat-
                            ically used for delivered Amazon S3 files. You can
                            also  specify  a  custom  prefix,  as described in
                            Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects .

                        ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
                            A prefix  that  Firehose  evaluates  and  adds  to
                            failed  records  before  writing  them to S3. This
                            prefix appears immediately  following  the  bucket
                            name.  For  information  about how to specify this
                            prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3  Objects
                            .

                        BufferingHints -> (structure)
                            The  buffering  option.  If no value is specified,
                            BufferingHints object default values are used.

                            SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                               Buffer incoming data to the specified size,  in
                               MiBs,  before delivering it to the destination.
                               The default value is 5. This parameter  is  op-
                               tional  but  if you specify a value for it, you
                               must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds
                               , and vice versa.

                               We  recommend setting this parameter to a value
                               greater than the amount of data  you  typically
                               ingest  into the Firehose stream in 10 seconds.
                               For example, if you typically ingest data at  1
                               MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher.

                            IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                               Buffer  incoming  data for the specified period
                               of time, in seconds, before  delivering  it  to
                               the destination. The default value is 300. This
                               parameter is optional  but  if  you  specify  a
                               value for it, you must also specify a value for
                               SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

                        CompressionFormat -> (string)
                            The compression format. If no value is  specified,
                            the default is UNCOMPRESSED .

                        EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The encryption configuration. If no value is spec-
                            ified, the default is no encryption.

                            NoEncryptionConfig -> (string)
                               Specifically override existing  encryption  in-
                               formation to ensure that no encryption is used.

                            KMSEncryptionConfig -> (structure)
                               The encryption key.

                               AWSKMSKeyARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the en-
                                   cryption key. Must belong to the same  Ama-

                            Firehose stream.

                            Enabled -> (boolean)
                               Enables or disables CloudWatch logging.

                            LogGroupName -> (string)
                               The  CloudWatch  group  name  for logging. This
                               value is required if CloudWatch logging is  en-
                               abled.

                            LogStreamName -> (string)
                               The  CloudWatch  log  stream  name for logging.
                               This value is required if CloudWatch logging is
                               enabled.

                     DataFormatConversionConfiguration -> (structure)

                            This  parameter  is  required if Enabled is set to
                            true.

                            RoleARN -> (string)
                               The role that Firehose can use to access Amazon
                               Web  Services  Glue.  This  role must be in the
                               same account you use  for  Firehose.  Cross-ac-
                               count roles aren't allowed.

                               Specifies the table version for the output data
                               schema.  If  you don't specify this version ID,
                               or if you set it to LATEST , Firehose uses  the
                               most  recent  version.  This means that any up-
                               dates to the table are automatically picked up.

                        InputFormatConfiguration -> (structure)
                            Specifies the deserializer that you want  Firehose
                            to  use  to  convert  the format of your data from
                            JSON. This parameter is required if Enabled is set
                            to true.

                            Deserializer -> (structure)
                               Specifies  which  deserializer  to use. You can
                               choose either the Apache Hive JSON SerDe or the
                               OpenX  JSON  SerDe.  If  both are non-null, the
                               server rejects the request.

                               OpenXJsonSerDe -> (structure)
                                   The OpenX SerDe. Used by Firehose for dese-
                                   rializing  data,  which means converting it
                                   from the JSON format in preparation for se-
                                   rializing  it to the Parquet or ORC format.
                                   This is one of two  deserializers  you  can
                                   choose,  depending  on which one offers the
                                   functionality you need. The other option is
                                   the native Hive / HCatalog JsonSerDe.

                                   ConvertDotsInJsonKeysToUnderscores       ->
                                   (boolean)
                                      When set to true ,  specifies  that  the
                                      names  of the keys include dots and that
                                      you want Firehose to replace  them  with
                                      underscores.   This  is  useful  because
                                      Apache Hive does not allow dots in  col-
                                      umn names. For example, if the JSON con-
                                      tains a key whose name is "a.b", you can
                                      define  the column name to be "a_b" when
                                      using this option.

                                      The default is false .

                                   CaseInsensitive -> (boolean)
                                      When set to true , which is the default,
                                      Firehose converts JSON keys to lowercase
                                      before deserializing them.

                                   ColumnToJsonKeyMappings -> (map)
                                      Maps column  names  to  JSON  keys  that
                                      aren't  identical  to  the column names.
                                      This is useful when  the  JSON  contains
                                      keys  that  are Hive keywords. For exam-
                                      ple, timestamp is a Hive keyword. If you
                                      have  a  JSON  key named timestamp , set
                                      this parameter to {"ts": "timestamp"} to
                                      map this key to a column named ts .

                                      key -> (string)

                                      value -> (string)

                               HiveJsonSerDe -> (structure)
                                   The  native Hive / HCatalog JsonSerDe. Used
                                   by Firehose for deserializing  data,  which
                                   means converting it from the JSON format in
                                   preparation for serializing it to the  Par-
                                   quet  or ORC format. This is one of two de-
                                   serializers you can  choose,  depending  on
                                   which  one  offers  the  functionality  you
                                   need. The other option is the OpenX SerDe.

                                   TimestampFormats -> (list)
                                      Indicates how you want Firehose to parse
                                      the  date  and  timestamps  that  may be
                                      present in  your  input  data  JSON.  To
                                      specify these format strings, follow the
                                      pattern syntax of  JodaTime's  DateTime-
                                      Format format strings. For more informa-
                                      tion, see Class DateTimeFormat . You can
                                      also  use  the  special  value millis to
                                      parse timestamps in epoch  milliseconds.
                                      If  you don't specify a format, Firehose
                                      uses java.sql.Timestamp::valueOf by  de-
                                      fault.

                                      (string)

                        OutputFormatConfiguration -> (structure)
                            Specifies the serializer that you want Firehose to
                            use to convert the format of your data to the Par-
                            quet  or ORC format. This parameter is required if
                            Enabled is set to true.

                            Serializer -> (structure)
                               Specifies which  serializer  to  use.  You  can
                               choose  either  the  ORC  SerDe  or the Parquet
                               SerDe. If both are non-null, the server rejects
                               the request.

                               ParquetSerDe -> (structure)

                                   Amazon S3. For more information, see Apache
                                   Parquet .

                                   BlockSizeBytes -> (integer)
                                      The  Hadoop  Distributed   File   System
                                      (HDFS) block size. This is useful if you
                                      intend to copy the data from  Amazon  S3
                                      to  HDFS before querying. The default is
                                      256 MiB and the minimum is 64 MiB. Fire-
                                      hose  uses this value for padding calcu-
                                      lations.

                                   PageSizeBytes -> (integer)
                                      The Parquet page size. Column chunks are
                                      divided  into pages. A page is conceptu-
                                      ally an indivisible unit  (in  terms  of
                                      compression  and  encoding). The minimum
                                      value is 64 KiB and  the  default  is  1
                                      MiB.

                                   Compression -> (string)
                                      The  compression  code  to use over data
                                      blocks. The possible values  are  UNCOM-
                                      PRESSED  ,  SNAPPY , and GZIP , with the
                                      default being SNAPPY .  Use  SNAPPY  for
                                      higher  decompression speed. Use GZIP if
                                      the compression ratio is more  important
                                      than speed.

                                   EnableDictionaryCompression -> (boolean)
                                      Indicates  whether  to enable dictionary
                                      compression.

                                      The maximum amount of padding to  apply.
                                      This is useful if you intend to copy the
                                      data  from  Amazon  S3  to  HDFS  before
                                      querying. The default is 0.

                                   WriterVersion -> (string)
                                      Indicates  the  version of row format to
                                      output. The possible values are  V1  and
                                      V2 . The default is V1 .

                               OrcSerDe -> (structure)
                                   A  serializer to use for converting data to
                                   the ORC format before storing it in  Amazon
                                   S3. For more information, see Apache ORC .

                                   StripeSizeBytes -> (integer)
                                      The  number of bytes in each stripe. The
                                      default is 64 MiB and the minimum  is  8
                                      MiB.

                                   BlockSizeBytes -> (integer)
                                      The   Hadoop   Distributed  File  System
                                      (HDFS) block size. This is useful if you
                                      intend  to  copy the data from Amazon S3
                                      to HDFS before querying. The default  is
                                      256 MiB and the minimum is 64 MiB. Fire-
                                      hose uses this value for padding  calcu-
                                      lations.

                                   RowIndexStride -> (integer)
                                      The  number  of  rows  between index en-
                                      tries. The default  is  10,000  and  the
                                      minimum is 1,000.

                                   EnablePadding -> (boolean)
                                      Set  this  to  true to indicate that you
                                      want stripes to be padded  to  the  HDFS
                                      block  boundaries. This is useful if you
                                      intend to copy the data from  Amazon  S3
                                      to  HDFS before querying. The default is
                                      false .

                                   PaddingTolerance -> (double)
                                      A number between 0 and  1  that  defines
                                      the  tolerance  for  block  padding as a
                                      decimal fraction of stripe size. The de-
                                      fault  value is 0.05, which means 5 per-
                                      cent of stripe size.

                                      For the default values  of  64  MiB  ORC
                                      stripes and 256 MiB HDFS blocks, the de-
                                      fault block padding tolerance of 5  per-
                                      cent  reserves  a maximum of 3.2 MiB for
                                      padding within the  256  MiB  block.  In
                                      such  a  case,  if  the  available  size
                                      within the block is more than 3.2 MiB, a
                                      new,  smaller  stripe is inserted to fit
                                      within that space. This ensures that  no
                                      stripe   crosses  block  boundaries  and
                                      causes remote reads within a  node-local
                                      task.

                                      Firehose  ignores  this  parameter  when
                                      OrcSerDe$EnablePadding is false .

                                      default is null .

                                      (string)

                                   BloomFilterFalsePositiveProbability      ->
                                   (double)
                                      The Bloom filter false  positive  proba-
                                      bility  (FPP).  The  lower  the FPP, the
                                      bigger the  Bloom  filter.  The  default
                                      value is 0.05, the minimum is 0, and the
                                      maximum is 1.

                                   DictionaryKeyThreshold -> (double)
                                      Represents the  fraction  of  the  total
                                      number  of  non-null  rows.  To turn off
                                      dictionary encoding, set  this  fraction
                                      to a number that is less than the number
                                      of distinct keys in a dictionary. To al-
                                      ways  use  dictionary encoding, set this
                                      threshold to 1.

                                   FormatVersion -> (string)
                                      The version of the file  to  write.  The
                                      possible  values  are  V0_11 and V0_12 .
                                      The default is V0_12 .

                        Enabled -> (boolean)
                            Defaults to true . Set it to false if you want  to
                            disable  format  conversion  while  preserving the
                            configuration details.

                     DynamicPartitioningConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The configuration of the dynamic  partitioning  mecha-
                        nism that creates smaller data sets from the streaming
                        data by partitioning it based on partition keys.  Cur-
                        rently,  dynamic  partitioning  is  only supported for
                        Amazon S3 destinations.

                               name:25,venuecity:12,venuestate:2,venueseats:6'
                               -  fields  are  fixed width in the source, with
                               each width specified after every column in  the
                               table.

                               JSON 's3://mybucket/jsonpaths.txt' - data is in
                               JSON format, and the path specified is the for-
                               mat of the data.

                               MiBs,  before delivering it to the destination.
                               The default value is 5. This parameter  is  op-
                               tional  but  if you specify a value for it, you
                               must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds
                               , and vice versa.

                               We  recommend setting this parameter to a value
                               greater than the amount of data  you  typically
                               ingest  into the Firehose stream in 10 seconds.
                               For example, if you typically ingest data at  1
                               MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher.

                               the destination. The default value is 300. This
                               parameter is optional  but  if  you  specify  a
                               value for it, you must also specify a value for
                               SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

                        CompressionFormat -> (string)

                            tials. It must be in the same region as the  Fire-
                            hose  stream  and the role. The secret ARN can re-
                            side in a  different  account  than  the  Firehose
                            stream and role as Firehose supports cross-account
                            secret access. This parameter is required when En-
                            abled is set to True .

                            Specifies  the  role  that  Firehose  assumes when
                            calling the Secrets Manager  API  operation.  When
                            you provide the role, it overrides any destination
                            specific role defined in the destination  configu-
                            ration.  If you do not provide the then we use the
                            destination specific role. This parameter  is  re-
                            quired for Splunk.

                        Enabled -> (boolean)
                            Specifies whether you want to use the secrets man-
                            ager feature. When set as True the secrets manager
                            configuration  overwrites  the existing secrets in
                            the destination configuration. When  it's  set  to
                            False  Firehose  falls  back to the credentials in
                            the destination configuration.

                            tries  delivery (including the first attempt). Af-
                            ter this time has elapsed,  the  failed  documents
                            are  written  to  Amazon  S3. Default value is 300
                            seconds (5 minutes). A value of 0  (zero)  results
                            in no retries.

                            failed records before writing  them  to  S3.  This
                            prefix  appears  immediately  following the bucket
                            name. For information about how  to  specify  this
                            prefix,  see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects
                            .

                        BufferingHints -> (structure)

                               MiBs, before delivering it to the  destination.
                               The  default  value is 5. This parameter is op-
                               tional but if you specify a value for  it,  you
                               must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds
                               , and vice versa.

                               We recommend setting this parameter to a  value
                               greater  than  the amount of data you typically
                               ingest into the Firehose stream in 10  seconds.
                               For  example, if you typically ingest data at 1
                               MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher.

                            IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                               Buffer incoming data for the  specified  period

                               the destination. The default value is 300. This
                               parameter  is  optional  but  if  you specify a
                               value for it, you must also specify a value for
                               SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

                        Amazon OpenSearch Serverless destination.

                        SubnetIds -> (list)
                            The IDs of the subnets that Firehose uses to  cre-
                            ate  ENIs in the VPC of the Amazon ES destination.
                            Make sure that the routing tables and inbound  and
                            outbound rules allow traffic to flow from the sub-
                            nets whose IDs are specified here to  the  subnets
                            that  have  the  destination  Amazon ES endpoints.
                            Firehose creates at least one ENI in each  of  the
                            subnets  that are specified here. Do not delete or
                            modify these ENIs.

                            The number of ENIs that Firehose  creates  in  the
                            subnets specified here scales up and down automat-
                            ically based on throughput. To enable Firehose  to
                            scale  up  the number of ENIs to match throughput,
                            ensure that you have sufficient quota. To help you
                            calculate the quota you need, assume that Firehose
                            can create up to  three  ENIs  for  this  Firehose
                            stream for each of the subnets specified here. For
                            more information about ENI quota, see Network  In-
                            terfaces in the Amazon VPC Quotas topic.

                            (string)

                        RoleARN -> (string)
                            The  ARN  of the IAM role that the Firehose stream
                            uses to create endpoints in the  destination  VPC.
                            You  can  use your existing Firehose delivery role
                            or you can specify a new  role.  In  either  case,
                            make  sure  that the role trusts the Firehose ser-
                            vice principal and that it  grants  the  following
                            permissions:

                            o ec2:DescribeVpcs

                            o ec2:DescribeVpcAttribute

                            o ec2:DescribeSubnets

                            o ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups

                            o ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces

                            o ec2:CreateNetworkInterface

                            o ec2:CreateNetworkInterfacePermission

                            o ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface

                            If  you  revoke these permissions after you create
                            the Firehose stream, Firehose can't scale  out  by
                            creating  more  ENIs  when  necessary.  You  might
                            therefore see a degradation in performance.

                        SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                            The IDs of the security groups that Firehose  uses
                            when  it  creates ENIs in the VPC of the Amazon ES
                            destination. You can use the same  security  group
                            that  the Amazon ES domain uses or different ones.
                            If you specify different security  groups,  ensure
                            that they allow outbound HTTPS traffic to the Ama-
                            zon ES domain's security group. Also  ensure  that
                            the Amazon ES domain's security group allows HTTPS
                            traffic from the security groups  specified  here.
                            If  you  use the same security group for both your
                            Firehose stream and the  Amazon  ES  domain,  make
                            sure  the security group inbound rule allows HTTPS
                            traffic. For more information about security group
                            rules,  see Security group rules in the Amazon VPC
                            documentation.

                            (string)

                        VpcId -> (string)
                            The ID of the Amazon ES destination's VPC.

                     DocumentIdOptions -> (structure)
                        Indicates the method for setting up document  ID.  The
                        supported  methods  are Firehose generated document ID
                        and OpenSearch Service generated document ID.

                        DefaultDocumentIdFormat -> (string)
                            When the FIREHOSE_DEFAULT option is chosen,  Fire-
                            hose  generates  a  unique  document  ID  for each
                            record based on a unique internal identifier.  The
                            generated  document  ID  is stable across multiple
                            delivery attempts, which helps  prevent  the  same
                            record from being indexed multiple times with dif-
                            ferent document IDs.

                            When the NO_DOCUMENT_ID option is chosen, Firehose
                            does  not include any document IDs in the requests
                            it sends to the Amazon  OpenSearch  Service.  This
                            causes  the  Amazon  OpenSearch  Service domain to
                            generate document IDs. In case of multiple  deliv-
                            ery attempts, this may cause the same record to be
                            indexed more than  once  with  different  document
                            IDs.  This  option enables write-heavy operations,
                            such as the ingestion of  logs  and  observability
                            data,  to  consume  less  resources  in the Amazon
                            OpenSearch Service domain, resulting  in  improved
                            performance.

                 AmazonopensearchserviceDestinationDescription -> (structure)
                     The destination in Amazon OpenSearch Service.

                     RoleARN -> (string)
                        The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Ser-
                        vices credentials.

                     DomainARN -> (string)
                        The ARN of the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain.

                     ClusterEndpoint -> (string)
                        The endpoint to use when communicating with the  clus-
                        ter.  Firehose uses either this ClusterEndpoint or the
                        DomainARN field to send data to Amazon OpenSearch Ser-
                        vice.

                     IndexName -> (string)
                        The Amazon OpenSearch Service index name.

                     TypeName -> (string)
                        The  Amazon OpenSearch Service type name. This applies
                        to Elasticsearch 6.x and lower versions. For  Elastic-
                        search  7.x  and  OpenSearch  Service  1.x, there's no
                        value for TypeName.

                     IndexRotationPeriod -> (string)
                        The Amazon OpenSearch Service index rotation period

                     BufferingHints -> (structure)
                        The buffering options.

                        IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                            Buffer incoming data for the specified  period  of
                            time, in seconds, before delivering it to the des-
                            tination. The default value is 300 (5 minutes).

                        SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                            Buffer incoming data to  the  specified  size,  in
                            MBs,  before delivering it to the destination. The
                            default value is 5.

                            We recommend setting this  parameter  to  a  value
                            greater  than the amount of data you typically in-
                            gest into the Firehose stream in 10  seconds.  For
                            example, if you typically ingest data at 1 MB/sec,
                            the value should be 10 MB or higher.

                     RetryOptions -> (structure)
                        The Amazon OpenSearch Service retry options.

                        DurationInSeconds -> (integer)
                            After an initial  failure  to  deliver  to  Amazon
                            OpenSearch  Service, the total amount of time dur-
                            ing which Firehose retries delivery (including the
                            first  attempt).  After this time has elapsed, the
                            failed documents are written to Amazon S3. Default
                            value  is  300  seconds  (5 minutes). A value of 0
                            (zero) results in no retries.

                     S3BackupMode -> (string)
                        The Amazon S3 backup mode.

                     S3DestinationDescription -> (structure)
                        Describes a destination in Amazon S3.

                        RoleARN -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Amazon  Web
                            Services  credentials.  For  more information, see
                            Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon  Web  Ser-
                            vices Service Namespaces .

                        BucketARN -> (string)
                            The  ARN  of  the S3 bucket. For more information,
                            see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)  and  Amazon  Web
                            Services Service Namespaces .

                        Prefix -> (string)
                            The "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automat-
                            ically used for delivered Amazon S3 files. You can
                            also  specify  a  custom  prefix,  as described in
                            Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects .

                        ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
                            A prefix  that  Firehose  evaluates  and  adds  to
                            failed  records  before  writing  them to S3. This
                            prefix appears immediately  following  the  bucket
                            name.  For  information  about how to specify this
                            prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3  Objects
                            .

                        BufferingHints -> (structure)
                            The  buffering  option.  If no value is specified,
                            BufferingHints object default values are used.

                            SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                               Buffer incoming data to the specified size,  in
                               MiBs,  before delivering it to the destination.
                               The default value is 5. This parameter  is  op-
                               tional  but  if you specify a value for it, you
                               must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds
                               , and vice versa.

                               We  recommend setting this parameter to a value
                               greater than the amount of data  you  typically
                               ingest  into the Firehose stream in 10 seconds.
                               For example, if you typically ingest data at  1
                               MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher.

                            IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                               Buffer  incoming  data for the specified period
                               of time, in seconds, before  delivering  it  to
                               the destination. The default value is 300. This
                               parameter is optional  but  if  you  specify  a
                               value for it, you must also specify a value for
                               SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

                        CompressionFormat -> (string)
                            The compression format. If no value is  specified,
                            the default is UNCOMPRESSED .

                        EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The encryption configuration. If no value is spec-
                            ified, the default is no encryption.

                            NoEncryptionConfig -> (string)
                               Specifically override existing  encryption  in-
                               formation to ensure that no encryption is used.

                            KMSEncryptionConfig -> (structure)
                               The encryption key.

                               AWSKMSKeyARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the en-
                                   cryption key. Must belong to the same  Ama-
                                   zon  Web Services Region as the destination
                                   Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see
                                   Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web

                        CloudWatchLoggingOptions -> (structure)
                            The Amazon CloudWatch  logging  options  for  your
                            Firehose stream.

                            Enabled -> (boolean)
                               Enables or disables CloudWatch logging.

                            LogGroupName -> (string)
                               The  CloudWatch  group  name  for logging. This
                               value is required if CloudWatch logging is  en-
                               abled.

                            LogStreamName -> (string)
                               The  CloudWatch  log  stream  name for logging.
                               This value is required if CloudWatch logging is
                               enabled.

                     ProcessingConfiguration -> (structure)
                        Describes a data processing configuration.

                        Enabled -> (boolean)
                            Enables or disables data processing.

                        Processors -> (list)
                            The data processors.

                            (structure)
                               Describes a data processor.

                               NOTE:
                                   If you want to add a new line delimiter be-

                                   to   Amazon   S3,  choose  AppendDelimiter-
                                   ToRecord as a processor type. You dont have
                                   to  put  a processor parameter when you se-
                                   lect AppendDelimiterToRecord .

                               Type -> (string)
                                   The type of processor.

                               Parameters -> (list)
                                   The processor parameters.

                                   (structure)
                                      Describes the processor parameter.

                                      ParameterName -> (string)
                                          The name of the parameter. Currently
                                          the  following  default  values  are
                                          supported: 3 for NumberOfRetries and
                                          60 for the BufferIntervalInSeconds .
                                          The BufferSizeInMBs  ranges  between
                                          0.2  MB  and  up to 3MB. The default
                                          buffering hint is 1MB for all desti-
                                          nations,  except Splunk. For Splunk,
                                          the default buffering  hint  is  256
                                          KB.

                                      ParameterValue -> (string)
                                          The parameter value.

                     CloudWatchLoggingOptions -> (structure)
                        Describes  the  Amazon  CloudWatch logging options for
                        your Firehose stream.

                        Enabled -> (boolean)
                            Enables or disables CloudWatch logging.

                        LogGroupName -> (string)
                            The CloudWatch group name for logging. This  value
                            is required if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

                        LogStreamName -> (string)
                            The  CloudWatch  log stream name for logging. This
                            value is required if  CloudWatch  logging  is  en-
                            abled.

                     VpcConfigurationDescription -> (structure)
                        The details of the VPC of the Amazon ES destination.

                        SubnetIds -> (list)
                            The  IDs of the subnets that Firehose uses to cre-
                            ate ENIs in the VPC of the Amazon ES  destination.
                            Make  sure that the routing tables and inbound and
                            outbound rules allow traffic to flow from the sub-
                            nets  whose  IDs are specified here to the subnets
                            that have the  destination  Amazon  ES  endpoints.
                            Firehose  creates  at least one ENI in each of the
                            subnets that are specified here. Do not delete  or
                            modify these ENIs.

                            The  number  of  ENIs that Firehose creates in the
                            subnets specified here scales up and down automat-
                            ically  based on throughput. To enable Firehose to
                            scale up the number of ENIs to  match  throughput,
                            ensure that you have sufficient quota. To help you
                            calculate the quota you need, assume that Firehose
                            can  create  up  to  three  ENIs for this Firehose
                            stream for each of the subnets specified here. For
                            more  information about ENI quota, see Network In-
                            terfaces in the Amazon VPC Quotas topic.

                            (string)

                        RoleARN -> (string)
                            The ARN of the IAM role that the  Firehose  stream
                            uses  to  create endpoints in the destination VPC.
                            You can use your existing Firehose  delivery  role
                            or  you  can  specify  a new role. In either case,
                            make sure that the role trusts the  Firehose  ser-
                            vice  principal  and  that it grants the following
                            permissions:

                            o ec2:DescribeVpcs

                            o ec2:DescribeVpcAttribute

                            o ec2:DescribeSubnets

                            o ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups

                            o ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces

                            o ec2:CreateNetworkInterface

                            o ec2:CreateNetworkInterfacePermission

                            o ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface

                            If you revoke these permissions after  you  create
                            the  Firehose  stream, Firehose can't scale out by
                            creating  more  ENIs  when  necessary.  You  might
                            therefore see a degradation in performance.

                        SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                            The  IDs of the security groups that Firehose uses
                            when it creates ENIs in the VPC of the  Amazon  ES
                            destination.  You  can use the same security group
                            that the Amazon ES domain uses or different  ones.
                            If  you  specify different security groups, ensure
                            that they allow outbound HTTPS traffic to the Ama-
                            zon  ES  domain's security group. Also ensure that
                            the Amazon ES domain's security group allows HTTPS
                            traffic  from  the security groups specified here.
                            If you use the same security group for  both  your
                            Firehose  stream  and  the  Amazon ES domain, make
                            sure the security group inbound rule allows  HTTPS
                            traffic. For more information about security group
                            rules, see Security group rules in the Amazon  VPC
                            documentation.

                            (string)

                        VpcId -> (string)
                            The ID of the Amazon ES destination's VPC.

                     DocumentIdOptions -> (structure)
                        Indicates  the  method for setting up document ID. The
                        supported methods are Firehose generated  document  ID
                        and OpenSearch Service generated document ID.

                        DefaultDocumentIdFormat -> (string)
                            When  the FIREHOSE_DEFAULT option is chosen, Fire-
                            hose generates  a  unique  document  ID  for  each
                            record  based on a unique internal identifier. The
                            generated document ID is  stable  across  multiple
                            delivery  attempts,  which  helps prevent the same
                            record from being indexed multiple times with dif-
                            ferent document IDs.

                            When the NO_DOCUMENT_ID option is chosen, Firehose
                            does not include any document IDs in the  requests
                            it  sends  to  the Amazon OpenSearch Service. This
                            causes the Amazon  OpenSearch  Service  domain  to
                            generate  document IDs. In case of multiple deliv-
                            ery attempts, this may cause the same record to be
                            indexed  more  than  once  with different document
                            IDs. This option enables  write-heavy  operations,
                            such  as  the  ingestion of logs and observability
                            data, to consume  less  resources  in  the  Amazon
                            OpenSearch  Service  domain, resulting in improved
                            performance.

                 SplunkDestinationDescription -> (structure)
                     The destination in Splunk.

                     HECEndpoint -> (string)
                        The HTTP Event Collector (HEC) endpoint to which Fire-
                        hose sends your data.

                     HECEndpointType -> (string)
                        This type can be either "Raw" or "Event."

                     HECToken -> (string)
                        A  GUID  you  obtain from your Splunk cluster when you
                        create a new HEC endpoint.

                     HECAcknowledgmentTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                        The amount of time that Firehose waits to  receive  an
                        acknowledgment  from Splunk after it sends it data. At
                        the end of the timeout period, Firehose  either  tries
                        to send the data again or considers it an error, based
                        on your retry settings.

                     RetryOptions -> (structure)
                        The retry behavior in case Firehose is unable  to  de-
                        liver  data  to Splunk or if it doesn't receive an ac-
                        knowledgment of receipt from Splunk.

                        DurationInSeconds -> (integer)
                            The total amount of time that Firehose  spends  on
                            retries.  This  duration  starts after the initial
                            attempt to send data to Splunk fails.  It  doesn't
                            include  the  periods  during which Firehose waits
                            for acknowledgment from Splunk after each attempt.

                     S3BackupMode -> (string)
                        Defines how documents should be  delivered  to  Amazon
                        S3.  When set to FailedDocumentsOnly , Firehose writes
                        any data that could not be indexed to  the  configured
                        Amazon  S3  destination.  When  set  to AllDocuments ,
                        Firehose delivers all incoming records to  Amazon  S3,
                        and also writes failed documents to Amazon S3. Default
                        value is FailedDocumentsOnly .

                     S3DestinationDescription -> (structure)
                        The Amazon S3 destination.>

                        RoleARN -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Amazon  Web
                            Services  credentials.  For  more information, see
                            Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon  Web  Ser-
                            vices Service Namespaces .

                        BucketARN -> (string)
                            The  ARN  of  the S3 bucket. For more information,
                            see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)  and  Amazon  Web
                            Services Service Namespaces .

                        Prefix -> (string)
                            The "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automat-
                            ically used for delivered Amazon S3 files. You can
                            also  specify  a  custom  prefix,  as described in
                            Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects .

                        ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
                            A prefix  that  Firehose  evaluates  and  adds  to
                            failed  records  before  writing  them to S3. This
                            prefix appears immediately  following  the  bucket
                            name.  For  information  about how to specify this
                            prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3  Objects
                            .

                        BufferingHints -> (structure)
                            The  buffering  option.  If no value is specified,
                            BufferingHints object default values are used.

                            SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                               Buffer incoming data to the specified size,  in
                               MiBs,  before delivering it to the destination.
                               The default value is 5. This parameter  is  op-
                               tional  but  if you specify a value for it, you
                               must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds
                               , and vice versa.

                               We  recommend setting this parameter to a value
                               greater than the amount of data  you  typically
                               ingest  into the Firehose stream in 10 seconds.
                               For example, if you typically ingest data at  1
                               MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher.

                            IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                               Buffer  incoming  data for the specified period
                               of time, in seconds, before  delivering  it  to
                               the destination. The default value is 300. This
                               parameter is optional  but  if  you  specify  a
                               value for it, you must also specify a value for
                               SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

                            calling the Secrets Manager  API  operation.  When
                            you provide the role, it overrides any destination
                            specific role defined in the destination  configu-
                            ration.  If you do not provide the then we use the
                            destination specific role. This parameter  is  re-
                            quired for Splunk.

                        Enabled -> (boolean)
                            Specifies whether you want to use the secrets man-
                            ager feature. When set as True the secrets manager
                            configuration  overwrites  the existing secrets in
                            the destination configuration. When  it's  set  to
                            False  Firehose  falls  back to the credentials in
                            the destination configuration.

                        data before it is delivered to the HTTPS endpoint des-
                        tination.  Firehose  teats these options as hints, and
                        it might  choose  to  use  more  optimal  values.  The
                        SizeInMBs  and  IntervalInSeconds  parameters  are op-
                        tional. However, if specify a value for one  of  them,
                        you must also provide a value for the other.

                        SizeInMBs -> (integer)

                            default value is 5.

                            We  recommend  setting  this  parameter to a value
                            greater than the amount of data you typically  in-
                            gest  into  the Firehose stream in 10 seconds. For
                            example, if you typically ingest data at 1 MB/sec,
                            the value should be 10 MB or higher.

                        IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                            Buffer  incoming  data for the specified period of
                            time, in seconds, before delivering it to the des-
                            tination. The default value is 300 (5 minutes).

                            the  destination  configuration.  When it's set to
                            False Firehose falls back to  the  credentials  in

                                      ParameterName -> (string)
                                          The name of the parameter. Currently
                                          the  following  default  values  are
                                          supported: 3 for NumberOfRetries and
                                          60 for the BufferIntervalInSeconds .

                     CloudWatchLoggingOptions -> (structure)
                        Describes  the  Amazon  CloudWatch logging options for
                        your Firehose stream.

                        Enabled -> (boolean)
                            Enables or disables CloudWatch logging.

                        LogGroupName -> (string)
                            The CloudWatch group name for logging. This  value
                            is required if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

                        LogStreamName -> (string)
                            The  CloudWatch  log stream name for logging. This
                            value is required if  CloudWatch  logging  is  en-
                            abled.

                     VpcConfigurationDescription -> (structure)
                        The details of the VPC of the Amazon ES destination.

                        SubnetIds -> (list)
                            The  IDs of the subnets that Firehose uses to cre-
                            ate ENIs in the VPC of the Amazon ES  destination.
                            Make  sure that the routing tables and inbound and
                            outbound rules allow traffic to flow from the sub-
                            nets  whose  IDs are specified here to the subnets
                            that have the  destination  Amazon  ES  endpoints.
                            Firehose  creates  at least one ENI in each of the
                            subnets that are specified here. Do not delete  or
                            modify these ENIs.

                            The  number  of  ENIs that Firehose creates in the
                            subnets specified here scales up and down automat-
                            ically  based on throughput. To enable Firehose to
                            scale up the number of ENIs to  match  throughput,
                            ensure that you have sufficient quota. To help you
                            calculate the quota you need, assume that Firehose
                            can  create  up  to  three  ENIs for this Firehose
                            stream for each of the subnets specified here. For
                            more  information about ENI quota, see Network In-
                            terfaces in the Amazon VPC Quotas topic.

                            (string)

                        RoleARN -> (string)
                            The ARN of the IAM role that the  Firehose  stream
                            uses  to  create endpoints in the destination VPC.
                            You can use your existing Firehose  delivery  role
                            or  you  can  specify  a new role. In either case,
                            make sure that the role trusts the  Firehose  ser-
                            vice  principal  and  that it grants the following
                            permissions:

                            o ec2:DescribeVpcs

                            o ec2:DescribeVpcAttribute

                            o ec2:DescribeSubnets

                            o ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups

                            o ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces

                            o ec2:CreateNetworkInterface

                            o ec2:CreateNetworkInterfacePermission

                            o ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface

                            If you revoke these permissions after  you  create
                            the  Firehose  stream, Firehose can't scale out by
                            creating  more  ENIs  when  necessary.  You  might
                            therefore see a degradation in performance.

                        SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                            The  IDs of the security groups that Firehose uses
                            when it creates ENIs in the VPC of the  Amazon  ES
                            destination.  You  can use the same security group
                            that the Amazon ES domain uses or different  ones.
                            If  you  specify different security groups, ensure
                            that they allow outbound HTTPS traffic to the Ama-
                            zon  ES  domain's security group. Also ensure that
                            the Amazon ES domain's security group allows HTTPS
                            traffic  from  the security groups specified here.
                            If you use the same security group for  both  your
                            Firehose  stream  and  the  Amazon ES domain, make
                            sure the security group inbound rule allows  HTTPS
                            traffic. For more information about security group
                            rules, see Security group rules in the Amazon  VPC
                            documentation.

                        Provides   a  list  of  DestinationTableConfigurations
                        which Firehose uses to deliver data to Apache  Iceberg
                        Tables.  Firehose will write data with insert if table
                        specific configuration is not provided here.

                        (structure)
                            Describes the configuration of  a  destination  in

                               berg table. Firehose will use these for running
                               Create,  Update,  or  Delete  operations on the
                               given Iceberg table.

                               (string)

                               the  errors  that  occurred while delivering to
                               this table will be prefixed with this value  in
                               S3 destination.

                     SchemaEvolutionConfiguration -> (structure)

                        delivering data to the destination. These options  are
                        treated  as hints, and therefore Firehose might choose
                        to use  different  values  when  it  is  optimal.  The
                        SizeInMBs  and  IntervalInSeconds  parameters  are op-
                        tional. However, if specify a value for one  of  them,
                        you must also provide a value for the other.

                        SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                            Buffer  incoming  data  to  the specified size, in
                            MiBs, before delivering it to the destination. The
                            default value is 5. This parameter is optional but
                            if you specify a value for it, you must also spec-
                            ify  a  value  for  IntervalInSeconds  ,  and vice
                            versa.

                            We recommend setting this  parameter  to  a  value
                            greater  than the amount of data you typically in-
                            gest into the Firehose stream in 10  seconds.  For
                            example,   if  you  typically  ingest  data  at  1
                            MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher.

                            is optional but if you specify a value for it, you
                            must also specify a value for SizeInMBs , and vice
                            versa.
