STOP-DELIVERY-STREAM-ENCRYPTION()            STOP-DELIVERY-STREAM-ENCRYPTION()



NAME
       stop-delivery-stream-encryption -

DESCRIPTION
       Disables server-side encryption (SSE) for the delivery stream.

       This operation is asynchronous. It returns immediately. When you invoke
       it, Kinesis Data Firehose first  sets  the  encryption  status  of  the
       stream  to  DISABLING , and then to DISABLED . You can continue to read
       and write data to your stream while its status is DISABLING  .  It  can
       take  up  to  5 seconds after the encryption status changes to DISABLED
       before all records written to the delivery stream are no longer subject
       to  encryption.  To find out whether a record or a batch of records was
       encrypted, check the response elements   PutRecordOutput$Encrypted  and
       PutRecordBatchOutput$Encrypted , respectively.

       To check the encryption state of a delivery stream, use  DescribeDeliv-
       eryStream .

       If SSE is enabled using a customer managed  CMK  and  then  you  invoke
       StopDeliveryStreamEncryption  , Kinesis Data Firehose schedules the re-
       lated KMS grant for retirement and then retires  it  after  it  ensures
       that it is finished delivering records to the destination.

       The  StartDeliveryStreamEncryption and StopDeliveryStreamEncryption op-
       erations have a combined limit of 25 calls per delivery stream  per  24
       hours. For example, you reach the limit if you call StartDeliveryStrea-
       mEncryption 13 times and StopDeliveryStreamEncryption 12 times for  the
       same delivery stream in a 24-hour period.

OPTIONS
       --delivery-stream-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  delivery  stream  for  which you want to disable
          server-side encryption (SSE).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       None
