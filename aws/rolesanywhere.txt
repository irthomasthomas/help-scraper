NAME
       rolesanywhere -

DESCRIPTION
       AWS Identity and Access Management Roles Anywhere provides a secure way
       for your workloads such as servers, containers, and  applications  run-
       ning outside of AWS to obtain Temporary AWS credentials. Your workloads
       can use the same IAM policies and roles that you have  configured  with
       native  AWS  applications to access AWS resources. Using IAM Roles Any-
       where will eliminate the need to manage long term credentials for work-
       loads running outside of AWS.

       To  use  IAM  Roles  Anywhere customer workloads will need to use X.509
       certificates issued by their Certificate Authority (CA) . The  Certifi-
       cate Authority (CA) needs to be registered with IAM Roles Anywhere as a
       trust anchor to establish trust between customer PKI and IAM Roles Any-
       where.  Customers  who  do  not manage their own PKI system can use AWS
       Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority (ACM PCA) to create a
       Certificate  Authority  and  use that to establish trust with IAM Roles
       Anywhere

       This guide describes the IAM rolesanywhere operations that you can call
       programmatically.  For general information about IAM Roles Anywhere see
