NAME
       rolesanywhere -

DESCRIPTION
       Identity and Access Management Roles Anywhere provides a secure way for
       your workloads such as servers, containers, and applications  that  run
       outside  of Amazon Web Services to obtain temporary Amazon Web Services
       credentials. Your workloads can use the same IAM policies and roles you
       have  for  native Amazon Web Services applications to access Amazon Web
       Services resources. Using IAM Roles Anywhere  eliminates  the  need  to
       manage  long-term  credentials  for workloads running outside of Amazon
       Web Services.

       To use IAM Roles Anywhere, your workloads must use  X.509  certificates
       issued  by  their  certificate authority (CA). You register the CA with
       IAM Roles Anywhere as a trust anchor to establish  trust  between  your
       public  key  infrastructure  (PKI) and IAM Roles Anywhere. If you don't
       manage your own PKI system, you can use Private  Certificate  Authority
       to create a CA and then use that to establish trust with IAM Roles Any-
       where.

       This guide describes the IAM Roles Anywhere  operations  that  you  can
       call  programmatically.  For more information about IAM Roles Anywhere,
       see the IAM Roles Anywhere User Guide .
