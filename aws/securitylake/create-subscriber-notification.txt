OPTIONS
       --configuration (tagged union structure)
          Specify  the  configuration  using which you want to create the sub-
          scriber notification.

          NOTE:
              This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following  top
              level  keys can be set: httpsNotificationConfiguration, sqsNoti-
              ficationConfiguration.

          httpsNotificationConfiguration -> (structure)
              The configurations used for HTTPS subscriber notification.

              authorizationApiKeyName -> (string)
                 The key name for the notification subscription.

              authorizationApiKeyValue -> (string)
                 The key value for the notification subscription.

              endpoint -> (string)
                 The subscription endpoint in Security Lake. If you prefer no-
                 tification with an HTTPs endpoint, populate this field.

              httpMethod -> (string)
                 The HTTPS method used for the notification subscription.

              targetRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the EventBridge API desti-
                 nations IAM role that you created. For more information about
                 ARNs  and  how to use them in policies, see Managing data ac-
                 cess and Amazon Web Services Managed Policies in  the  Amazon
                 Security Lake User Guide .

          sqsNotificationConfiguration -> (structure)
              The configurations for SQS subscriber notification.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          httpsNotificationConfiguration={authorizationApiKeyName=string,authorizationApiKeyValue=string,endpoint=string,httpMethod=string,targetRoleArn=string},sqsNotificationConfiguration={}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "httpsNotificationConfiguration": {
              "authorizationApiKeyName": "string",
              "authorizationApiKeyValue": "string",
              "endpoint": "string",
              "httpMethod": "POST"|"PUT",
              "targetRoleArn": "string"
            },
            "sqsNotificationConfiguration": {

            }
          }

       --subscriber-id (string)
          The subscriber ID for the notification subscription.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a subscriber notification

       The following create-subscriber-notification example shows how to spec-
       ify  subscriber  notification to create a notification when new data is
       written to the data lake.

          aws securitylake create-subscriber-notification \
              --subscriber-id "12345ab8-1a34-1c34-1bd4-12345ab9012" \
              --configuration '{"httpsNotificationConfiguration": {"targetRoleArn":"arn:aws:iam::XXX:role/service-role/RoleName", "endpoint":"https://account-management.$3.$2.securitylake.aws.dev/v1/datalake"}}'

       Output:

          {
              "subscriberEndpoint": [
                  "https://account-management.$3.$2.securitylake.aws.dev/v1/datalake"
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Subscriber management in the Amazon  Security
       Lake User Guide.

OUTPUT
       subscriberEndpoint -> (string)
          The subscriber endpoint to which exception messages are posted.
