OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.

                 The type of encryption key used by secure the  Security  Lake

                 Replication  enables  automatic,  asynchronous copying of ob-
                 jects across Amazon S3 buckets. Amazon S3  buckets  that  are
                 configured  for  object  replication can be owned by the same
                 Amazon Web Services account or by different accounts. You can
                 replicate objects to a single destination bucket or to multi-
                 ple destination buckets. The destination buckets  can  be  in
                 different  Amazon Web Services Regions or within the same Re-
                 gion as the source bucket.

                 Set up one or more rollup Regions by providing the Region  or
                 Regions that should contribute to the central rollup Region.

                 ter uses the IAM role you created that is managed by Security
                 Lake, to ensure the replication setting is correct.

                     in Amazon Security Lake.

                     retentionPeriod -> (integer)
                        The retention period specifies a fixed period of  time
                        during  which the Security Lake object remains locked.
                        You can specify the retention period in days  for  one
                        or more sources.

                 Services resources. Security Lake requires an  ARN  when  you
                 need to specify a resource unambiguously across all of Amazon
                 Web Services, such as  in  IAM  policies,  Amazon  Relational
                 Database Service (Amazon RDS) tags, and API calls.
