OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       configurations -> (map)
          Retrieves the Security Lake configuration object.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Provides details of lake configuration object in Amazon Security
              Lake.

              encryptionKey -> (string)
                 The type of encryption key used by Security Lake  to  encrypt
                 the lake configuration

              replicationDestinationRegions -> (list)
                 Replication  enables  automatic,  asynchronous copying of ob-
                 jects across Amazon S3 buckets. Amazon S3  buckets  that  are
                 configured  for  object  replication can be owned by the same
                 AWS account or by different accounts. You can  replicate  ob-
                 jects  to a single destination bucket or to multiple destina-
                 tion buckets. The destination buckets  can  be  in  different
                 Amazon  Web Services Regions or within the same Region as the
                 source bucket.

                 Set up one or more rollup Regions by providing the Region  or
                 Regions that should contribute to the central rollup Region.

                 (string)

              replicationRoleArn -> (string)
                 Replication  settings for the Amazon S3 buckets. This parame-
                 ter uses the IAM role created by you that is managed by Secu-
                 rity Lake, to ensure the replication setting is correct.

              retentionSettings -> (list)
                 Retention settings for the destination Amazon S3 buckets.

                 (structure)
                     Retention  settings for the destination Amazon S3 buckets
                     in Security Lake.

                     retentionPeriod -> (integer)
                        The retention period specifies a fixed period of  time
                        during  which the Security Lake object remains locked.
                        You can specify the retention period for one  or  more
                        source in days.

                        The  range of storage classes that you can choose from
                        based on the data access,  resiliency,  and  cost  re-
                        quirements of your workloads.

              s3BucketArn -> (string)
                 Amazon  Resource  Names  (ARNs)  uniquely identify Amazon Web
                 Services resources. Security Lake requires an  ARN  when  you
                 need to specify a resource unambiguously across all of Amazon
                 Web Services, such as  in  IAM  policies,  Amazon  Relational
                 Database Service (Amazon RDS) tags, and API calls.

              status -> (string)
                 Retrieves  the  status  of the configuration operation for an
                 account in Amazon Security Lake.

              tagsMap -> (map)
                 A tag is a label that you assign to an  Amazon  Web  Services
                 resource.  Each  tag consists of a key and an optional value,
                 both of which you define.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)
