OPTIONS
       --configurations (map)
          Specify  the  Region  or  Regions  that  will contribute data to the
          rollup region.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Provides details of Amazon Security Lake configuration object.

              encryptionKey -> (string)
                 The type of encryption key used by Amazon  Security  Lake  to
                 encrypt the Security Lake configuration object.

              replicationDestinationRegions -> (list)
                 Replication  enables  automatic,  asynchronous copying of ob-
                 jects across Amazon S3 buckets. Amazon S3  buckets  that  are
                 configured  for  object  replication can be owned by the same
                 Amazon Web Services account or by different accounts. You can
                 replicate objects to a single destination bucket or to multi-
                 ple destination buckets. The destination buckets  can  be  in
                 different  Amazon Web Services Regions or within the same Re-
                 gion as the source bucket.

                 Set up one or more rollup Regions by providing the Region  or
                 Regions that should contribute to the central rollup Region.

                 (string)

              replicationRoleArn -> (string)
                 Replication  settings for the Amazon S3 buckets. This parame-
                 ter uses the Identity and Access Management  (IAM)  role  you
                 created  that  is  managed  by  Security  Lake, to ensure the
                 replication setting is correct.

              retentionSettings -> (list)
                 Retention settings for the destination Amazon S3 buckets.

                 (structure)
                     Retention settings for the destination Amazon S3  buckets
                     in Amazon Security Lake.

                     retentionPeriod -> (integer)
                        The  retention period specifies a fixed period of time
                        during which the Security Lake object remains  locked.
                        You  can  specify the retention period in days for one
                        or more sources.

                     storageClass -> (string)
                        The range of storage classes that you can choose  from
                        based  on  the  data  access, resiliency, and cost re-
                        quirements of your workloads.

              tagsMap -> (map)
                 A tag is a label that you assign to an  Amazon  Web  Services
                 resource.  Each  tag consists of a key and an optional value,
                 both of which you define.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

            KeyName1=encryptionKey=string,replicationDestinationRegions=string,string,replicationRoleArn=string,retentionSettings=[{retentionPeriod=integer,storageClass=string},{retentionPeriod=integer,storageClass=string}],tagsMap={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},KeyName2=encryptionKey=string,replicationDestinationRegions=string,string,replicationRoleArn=string,retentionSettings=[{retentionPeriod=integer,storageClass=string},{retentionPeriod=integer,storageClass=string}],tagsMap={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}

          Where valid key names are:
            us-east-1
            us-west-2
            eu-central-1
            us-east-2
            eu-west-1
            ap-northeast-1
            ap-southeast-2

       JSON Syntax:

          {"us-east-1"|"us-west-2"|"eu-central-1"|"us-east-2"|"eu-west-1"|"ap-northeast-1"|"ap-southeast-2": {
                "encryptionKey": "string",
                "replicationDestinationRegions": ["us-east-1"|"us-west-2"|"eu-central-1"|"us-east-2"|"eu-west-1"|"ap-northeast-1"|"ap-southeast-2", ...],
                "replicationRoleArn": "string",

                  {
                    "retentionPeriod": integer,
                    "storageClass": "STANDARD_IA"|"ONEZONE_IA"|"INTELLIGENT_TIERING"|"GLACIER_IR"|"GLACIER"|"DEEP_ARCHIVE"|"EXPIRE"
                  }
                  ...

                "tagsMap": {"string": "string"
                  ...}
              }
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
