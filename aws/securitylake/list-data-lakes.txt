OPTIONS
       --regions (list)
          The list of Regions where Security Lake is enabled.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the Security Lake configuration object

       The following list-data-lakes example lists the  Amazon  Security  Lake
       configuration  object  for  the  specified AWS Region. You can use this
       command to determine whether Security Lake is enabled  in  a  specified
       Region or Regions.

          aws securitylake list-data-lakes \
              --regions "us-east-1"

                     Replication  enables  automatic,  asynchronous copying of
                     objects across Amazon S3 buckets.  S3  buckets  that  are
                     configured  for  object  replication  can be owned by the
                     same Amazon Web Services  account  or  by  different  ac-
                     counts. You can replicate objects to a single destination
                     bucket or to multiple destination buckets.  The  destina-
                     tion  buckets  can  be in different Regions or within the
                     same Region as the source bucket.

                     Replication settings for the Amazon S3 buckets. This  pa-
                     rameter  uses  the  Identity  and Access Management (IAM)
                     role you created that is managed by Security Lake, to en-
                     sure the replication setting is correct.

                 exception -> (structure)
                     The details of the last UpdateDataLake or  DeleteDataLake
                     API request which failed.

                        The  reason code for the exception of the last Update-
                        DataLake or DeleteDataLake API request.
