CREATE-DATA-LAKE()                                          CREATE-DATA-LAKE()



NAME
       create-data-lake -

DESCRIPTION
       Initializes  an Amazon Security Lake instance with the provided (or de-
       fault) configuration. You can enable Security Lake in Amazon  Web  Ser-
       vices  Regions  with customized settings before enabling log collection
       in Regions. To specify particular Regions, configure these Regions  us-
       ing  the configurations parameter. If you have already enabled Security
       Lake in a Region when you call this command, the  command  will  update
       the Region if you provide new configuration parameters. If you have not
       already enabled Security Lake in the Region when you call this API,  it
       will  set  up the data lake in the Region with the specified configura-
       tions.

       When you enable Security Lake, it starts ingesting security data  after
       the CreateAwsLogSource call. This includes ingesting security data from
       sources, storing data, and making data accessible to subscribers. Secu-
       rity  Lake also enables all the existing settings and resources that it
       stores or maintains for your Amazon Web Services account in the current
       Region,  including  security  log and event data. For more information,
       see the Amazon Security Lake User Guide .

                     gions specified in this parameter.

                     Replication enables automatic,  asynchronous  copying  of
                     objects  across  Amazon  S3  buckets. S3 buckets that are
                     configured for object replication can  be  owned  by  the
                     same  Amazon  Web  Services  account  or by different ac-
                     counts. You can replicate objects to a single destination
                     bucket  or  to multiple destination buckets. The destina-
                     tion buckets can be in different Regions  or  within  the
                     same Region as the source bucket.

                     (string)

                 roleArn -> (string)
                     Replication  settings for the Amazon S3 buckets. This pa-
                     rameter uses the Identity  and  Access  Management  (IAM)
                     role you created that is managed by Security Lake, to en-
                     sure the replication setting is correct.

              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --meta-store-manager-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) used to create and  update  the  Glue
          table. This table contains partitions generated by the ingestion and
          normalization of Amazon Web Services log sources and custom sources.

       --tags (list)
          An array of objects, one for each tag to  associate  with  the  data
          lake  configuration.  For  each tag, you must specify both a tag key
          and a tag value. A tag value cannot be null, but it can be an  empty
          string.

          (structure)
              A  tag  is a label that you can define and associate with Amazon
              Web Services resources, including certain types of Amazon  Secu-
              rity Lake resources. Tags can help you identify, categorize, and
              manage resources in different ways, such as by  owner,  environ-
              ment, or other criteria. You can associate tags with the follow-
              ing types of Security Lake resources: subscribers, and the  data
              lake configuration for your Amazon Web Services account in indi-
              vidual Amazon Web Services Regions.

              A resource can have up to 50 tags. Each tag consists  of  a  re-
              quired tag key and an associated tag value . A tag key is a gen-
              eral label that acts as a  category  for  a  more  specific  tag
              value.  Each tag key must be unique and it can have only one tag
              value. A tag value acts as a descriptor for a tag key. Tag  keys
              and  values  are  case sensitive. They can contain letters, num-
              bers, spaces, or the following symbols: _ . : / = + @ -

              For more information, see Tagging Amazon Security Lake resources
              in the Amazon Security Lake User Guide .

              key -> (string)
                 The  name  of the tag. This is a general label that acts as a
                 category for a more specific tag value (value ).

              value -> (string)
                 The value thats associated with the specified tag key (key ).
                 This  value acts as a descriptor for the tag key. A tag value
                 cannot be null, but it can be an empty string.

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

                     Replication  enables  automatic,  asynchronous copying of
                     objects across Amazon S3 buckets.  S3  buckets  that  are
                     configured  for  object  replication  can be owned by the
                     same Amazon Web Services  account  or  by  different  ac-
                     counts. You can replicate objects to a single destination
                     bucket or to multiple destination buckets.  The  destina-
                     tion  buckets  can  be in different Regions or within the
                     same Region as the source bucket.
