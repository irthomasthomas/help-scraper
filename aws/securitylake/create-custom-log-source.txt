CREATE-CUSTOM-LOG-SOURCE()                          CREATE-CUSTOM-LOG-SOURCE()



NAME
       create-custom-log-source -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds a third-party custom source in Amazon Security Lake, from the Ama-
       zon Web Services Region where you want to create a custom source. Secu-
       rity  Lake can collect logs and events from third-party custom sources.
       After creating the appropriate IAM role to  invoke  Glue  crawler,  use
       this  API  to add a custom source name in Security Lake. This operation
       creates a partition in the Amazon S3 bucket for Security  Lake  as  the
       target location for log files from the custom source. In addition, this
       operation also creates an associated Glue table and an Glue crawler.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --source-name (string)
          Specify the name for a third-party custom source. This must be a Re-
          gionally unique value. The sourceName you enter here, is used in the
          LogProviderRole  name  which  follows the convention AmazonSecurity-
          Lake-Provider-{name of the custom source}-{region} . You must use  a
          CustomLogSource name that is shorter than or equal to 20 characters.
          This ensures that the LogProviderRole name is below the 64 character
          limit.

       --source-version (string)
          Specify  the  source  version  for the third-party custom source, to
          limit log collection to a specific version of custom data source.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                 The ARN of the IAM role to be used by the entity putting logs
                 into  your  custom source partition. Security Lake will apply
                 the correct access policies to this role, but you must  first
                 manually  create the trust policy for this role. The IAM role
                 name must start with the text 'Security Lake'. The  IAM  role
                 must trust the logProviderAccountId to assume the role.

          sourceName -> (string)
              The name for a third-party custom source. This must be a Region-
              ally unique value.

          sourceVersion -> (string)
              The version for a third-party custom source. This must be a  Re-
