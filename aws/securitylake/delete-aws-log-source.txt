DELETE-AWS-LOG-SOURCE()                                DELETE-AWS-LOG-SOURCE()



NAME
       delete-aws-log-source -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  a  natively supported Amazon Web Service as an Amazon Security
       Lake source. You can remove a source for one or more Regions. When  you
       remove the source, Security Lake stops collecting data from that source
       in the specified Regions and accounts, and subscribers  can  no  longer
       consume  new  data from the source. However, subscribers can still con-
       sume data that Security Lake collected from the source before removal.

       You can choose any source type in any Amazon Web  Services  Region  for
       either  accounts  that are part of a trusted organization or standalone
       accounts.

OPTIONS
       --sources (list)
          Specify the natively-supported Amazon Web Services service to remove
          as a source in Security Lake.

          (structure)
              The  Security  Lake logs source configuration file describes the
              information needed to generate Security Lake logs.

              accounts -> (list)
                 Specify the Amazon Web Services account information where you
                 want to enable Security Lake.

                 (string)

              regions -> (list)
                 Specify the Regions where you want to enable Security Lake.

                 (string)

              sourceName -> (string)
                 The name for a Amazon Web Services source. This must be a Re-
                 gionally unique value.

              sourceVersion -> (string)
                 The version for a Amazon Web Services source. This must be  a
                 Regionally unique value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          accounts=string,string,regions=string,string,sourceName=string,sourceVersion=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "accounts": ["string", ...],
              "regions": ["string", ...],
              "sourceName": "ROUTE53"|"VPC_FLOW"|"SH_FINDINGS"|"CLOUD_TRAIL_MGMT"|"LAMBDA_EXECUTION"|"S3_DATA"|"EKS_AUDIT"|"WAF",
              "sourceVersion": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
