DELETE-AWS-LOG-SOURCE()                                DELETE-AWS-LOG-SOURCE()



NAME
       delete-aws-log-source -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  a  natively supported Amazon Web Service as an Amazon Security
       Lake source. When you remove the source, Security Lake stops collecting
       data  from  that source, and subscribers can no longer consume new data
       from the source. Subscribers can still consume data that Security  Lake
       collected from the source before disablement.

       You  can  choose  any source type in any Amazon Web Services Region for
       either accounts that are part of a trusted organization  or  standalone
       accounts.  At least one of the three dimensions is a mandatory input to
       this API. However, you can supply any combination of the  three  dimen-
       sions to this API.

       By  default,  a  dimension refers to the entire set. This is overridden
       when you supply any one of the inputs. For instance, when  you  do  not
       specify members, the API disables all Security Lake member accounts for
       sources. Similarly, when you do not specify Regions, Security  Lake  is
       disabled for all the Regions where Security Lake is available as a ser-
       vice.

       When you don't provide a dimension,  Security  Lake  assumes  that  the
       missing  dimension  refers to the entire set. For example, if you don't
       provide specific accounts, the API applies to the  entire  set  of  ac-
       counts in your organization.

OPTIONS
       --disable-all-dimensions (map)
          Removes  the  specific Amazon Web Services sources from specific ac-
          counts and specific Regions.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (map)
              key -> (string)

              value -> (list)
                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string,KeyName2=KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {"string": ["string", ...]
                ...}
            ...}

       --disable-single-dimension (list)
          Removes all Amazon Web Services sources from  specific  accounts  or
          Regions.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --disable-two-dimensions (map)
          Remove  a specific Amazon Web Services source from specific accounts
          or Regions.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": ["string", ...]
            ...}

       --input-order (list)
          This is a mandatory input. Specify the input order to disable dimen-
          sions  in  Security  Lake, namely Region (Amazon Web Services Region
          code, source type, and member (account ID of a specific  Amazon  Web
          Services account).

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            REGION
            SOURCE_TYPE
            MEMBER

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
