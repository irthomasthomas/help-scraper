TAG-RESOURCE()                                                  TAG-RESOURCE()



NAME
       tag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds or updates one or more tags that are associated with an Amazon Se-
       curity Lake resource: a subscriber, or the data lake configuration  for
       your  Amazon  Web  Services account in a particular Amazon Web Services
       Region. A tag is a label that you can define and associate with  Amazon
       Web  Services resources. Each tag consists of a required tag key and an
       associated tag value . A tag key is a general label that acts as a cat-
       egory  for  a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as a descriptor
       for a tag key. Tags can help you identify, categorize, and  manage  re-
       sources in different ways, such as by owner, environment, or other cri-
       teria. For more information, see Tagging Amazon Security Lake resources
       in the Amazon Security Lake User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Security Lake resource
          to add or update the tags for.

       --tags (list)
          An array of objects, one for each tag (key and value)  to  associate
          with the Amazon Security Lake resource. For each tag, you must spec-
          ify both a tag key and a tag value. A tag value cannot be null,  but
          it can be an empty string.

          (structure)
              A  tag  is a label that you can define and associate with Amazon
              Web Services resources, including certain types of Amazon  Secu-
              rity Lake resources. Tags can help you identify, categorize, and
              manage resources in different ways, such as by  owner,  environ-
              ment, or other criteria. You can associate tags with the follow-
              ing types of Security Lake resources: subscribers, and the  data
              lake configuration for your Amazon Web Services account in indi-
              vidual Amazon Web Services Regions.

              A resource can have up to 50 tags. Each tag consists  of  a  re-
              quired tag key and an associated tag value . A tag key is a gen-
              eral label that acts as a  category  for  a  more  specific  tag
              value.  Each tag key must be unique and it can have only one tag
              value. A tag value acts as a descriptor for a tag key. Tag  keys
              and  values  are  case sensitive. They can contain letters, num-
              bers, spaces, or the following symbols: _ . : / = + @ -

              For more information, see Tagging Amazon Security Lake resources
              in the Amazon Security Lake User Guide .

              key -> (string)
                 The  name  of the tag. This is a general label that acts as a
                 category for a more specific tag value (value ).

              value -> (string)
                 The value thats associated with the specified tag key (key ).
                 This  value acts as a descriptor for the tag key. A tag value
                 cannot be null, but it can be an empty string.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To add tags to an existing resource

       The  following  tag-resource example add tags to an existing subscriber
       resource. To create a new resource and add one  or  more  tags  to  it,
       don't use this operation. Instead, use the appropriate Create operation
       for the the type of resource that you want to create.

          aws securitylake tag-resource \
              --resource-arn "arn:aws:securitylake:us-east-1:123456789012:subscriber/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab" \
              --tags key=Environment,value=Cloud

       This command produces no output.
