CREATE-DATALAKE()                                            CREATE-DATALAKE()



NAME
       create-datalake -

DESCRIPTION
       Initializes  an Amazon Security Lake instance with the provided (or de-
       fault) configuration. You can enable Security Lake in Regions with cus-
       tomized  settings in advance before enabling log collection in Regions.
       You can either use the enableAll parameter to specify  all  Regions  or
       you  can specify the Regions you want to enable Security Lake using the
       Regions parameter and configure these Regions using the  configurations
       parameter.  When  the  CreateDataLake  API is called multiple times, if
       that Region is already enabled, it will update the Region if configura-
       tion  for  that  Region is provided. If that Region is a new Region, it
       will be set up with the customized configurations if it is specified.

       When you enable Security Lake, it starts ingesting security data  after
       the CreateAwsLogSource call. This includes ingesting security data from
       sources, storing data, and making data accessible to subscribers. Secu-
       rity  Lake also enables all the existing settings and resources that it
       stores or maintains for your account in the current  Region,  including
       security log and event data. For more information, see the Amazon Secu-
       rity Lake User Guide.

OPTIONS
       --configurations (map)
          Enable Security Lake with the specified configurations  settings  to
          begin ingesting security data.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Provides details of lake configuration object in Amazon Security
              Lake.

              encryptionKey -> (string)
                 The type of encryption key used by Security Lake  to  encrypt
                 the lake configuration object.

              replicationDestinationRegions -> (list)
                 Replication  enables  automatic,  asynchronous copying of ob-
                 jects across Amazon S3 buckets. Amazon S3  buckets  that  are
                 configured  for  object  replication can be owned by the same
                 Amazon Web Services account or by different accounts. You can
                 replicate objects to a single destination bucket or to multi-
                 ple destination buckets. The destination buckets  can  be  in
                 different  Amazon Web Services Regions or within the same Re-
                 gion as the source bucket.

                 Set up one or more rollup Regions by providing the Region  or
                 Regions that should contribute to the central rollup Region.

                 (string)

              replicationRoleArn -> (string)
                 Replication  settings for the Amazon S3 buckets. This parame-
                 ter uses the IAM role created by you that is managed by Secu-
                 rity Lake, to ensure the replication setting is correct.

              retentionSettings -> (list)
                 Retention settings for the destination Amazon S3 buckets.

                 (structure)
                     Retention  settings for the destination Amazon S3 buckets
                     in Security Lake.

                     retentionPeriod -> (integer)
                        The retention period specifies a fixed period of  time
                        during  which the Security Lake object remains locked.
                        You can specify the retention period for one  or  more
                        source in days.

                     storageClass -> (string)
                        The  range of storage classes that you can choose from
                        based on the data access,  resiliency,  and  cost  re-
                        quirements of your workloads.

              tagsMap -> (map)
                 A  tag  is  a label that you assign to an Amazon Web Services
                 resource. Each tag consists of a key and an  optional  value,
                 both of which you define.

       --regions (list)
          Enable Security Lake in the specified Regions to begin ingesting se-
          curity data. To enable Security Lake in specific Amazon Web Services
          Regions, such as us-east-1 or  ap-northeast-3,  provide  the  Region
          codes.  For  a  list of Region codes, see Region codes in the Amazon
          Web Services General Reference.

          (string)

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
