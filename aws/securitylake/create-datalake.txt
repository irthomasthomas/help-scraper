CREATE-DATALAKE()                                            CREATE-DATALAKE()



NAME
       create-datalake -

DESCRIPTION
       Initializes  an Amazon Security Lake instance with the provided (or de-
       fault) configuration. You can enable Security Lake in Amazon  Web  Ser-
       vices  Regions  with customized settings before enabling log collection
       in Regions. You can either use the enableAll parameter to  specify  all
       Regions  or specify the Regions where you want to enable Security Lake.
       To specify particular Regions, use the Regions parameter and then  con-
       figure  these  Regions  using the configurations parameter. If you have
       already enabled Security Lake in a Region when you call  this  command,
       the command will update the Region if you provide new configuration pa-
       rameters. If you have not already enabled Security Lake in  the  Region
       when you call this API, it will set up the data lake in the Region with
       the specified configurations.

       When you enable Security Lake, it starts ingesting security data  after
       the CreateAwsLogSource call. This includes ingesting security data from
       sources, storing data, and making data accessible to subscribers. Secu-
       rity  Lake also enables all the existing settings and resources that it
       stores or maintains for your Amazon Web Services account in the current
       Region,  including  security  log and event data. For more information,
       see the Amazon Security Lake User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --configurations (map)
          Specify the Region or Regions  that  will  contribute  data  to  the
          rollup region.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Provides details of Amazon Security Lake configuration object.

              encryptionKey -> (string)
                 The  type  of  encryption key used by Amazon Security Lake to
                 encrypt the Security Lake configuration object.

              replicationDestinationRegions -> (list)
                 Replication enables automatic, asynchronous  copying  of  ob-
                 jects  across  Amazon  S3 buckets. Amazon S3 buckets that are
                 configured for object replication can be owned  by  the  same
                 Amazon Web Services account or by different accounts. You can
                 replicate objects to a single destination bucket or to multi-
                 ple  destination  buckets.  The destination buckets can be in
                 different Amazon Web Services Regions or within the same  Re-
                 gion as the source bucket.

                 Set  up one or more rollup Regions by providing the Region or
                 Regions that should contribute to the central rollup Region.

                 (string)

              replicationRoleArn -> (string)
                 Replication settings for the Amazon S3 buckets. This  parame-
                 ter  uses  the  Identity and Access Management (IAM) role you
                 created that is managed  by  Security  Lake,  to  ensure  the
                 replication setting is correct.

              retentionSettings -> (list)
                 Retention settings for the destination Amazon S3 buckets.

                 (structure)
                     Retention  settings for the destination Amazon S3 buckets
                     in Amazon Security Lake.

                     retentionPeriod -> (integer)
                        The retention period specifies a fixed period of  time
                        during  which the Security Lake object remains locked.
                        You can specify the retention period in days  for  one
                        or more sources.

                     storageClass -> (string)
                        The  range of storage classes that you can choose from
                        based on the data access,  resiliency,  and  cost  re-
                        quirements of your workloads.

              tagsMap -> (map)
                 A  tag  is  a label that you assign to an Amazon Web Services
                 resource. Each tag consists of a key and an  optional  value,
                 both of which you define.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

          normalization of Amazon Web Services log sources and custom sources.

       --regions (list)
          Enable  Security  Lake  in the specified Regions. To enable Security
          Lake in specific Amazon Web Services Regions, such as  us-east-1  or
          ap-northeast-3,  provide  the  Region  codes.  For  a list of Region
          codes, see Amazon Security Lake endpoints in the Amazon Web Services
          General Reference.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
