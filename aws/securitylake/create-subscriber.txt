            S3

          The Amazon Web Services account ID used to access your data.

       --external-id (string)

          ing the role assert the circumstances in which they  are  operating.

          be assumed only under specific circumstances.

       --source-types (list)
          The supported Amazon Web Services from which  logs  and  events  are
          collected.  Security  Lake supports log and event collection for na-
          tively supported Amazon Web Services.

          (tagged union structure)
              The supported source types from which logs and events  are  col-
              lected in Amazon Security Lake. For the list of supported Amazon
              Web Services, see the Amazon Security Lake User Guide .

              NOTE:
                 This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of  the  following
                 top level keys can be set: awsSourceType, customSourceType.

              awsSourceType -> (string)
                 Amazon  Security  Lake  supports log and event collection for
                 natively supported Amazon Web Services.

              customSourceType -> (string)
                 Amazon Security Lake supports custom source types. For a  de-
                 tailed list, see the Amazon Security Lake User Guide.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          awsSourceType=string,customSourceType=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "awsSourceType": "ROUTE53"|"VPC_FLOW"|"CLOUD_TRAIL"|"SH_FINDINGS",
              "customSourceType": "string"

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
