       --account-id (string)

       --external-id (string)
          The  external ID of the subscriber. External ID allows the user that
          is assuming the role to assert the circumstances in which  they  are
          operating.  It  also  provides a way for the account owner to permit
          the role to be assumed only under specific circumstances.

       --source-types (list)
          The supported Amazon Web  Services  services  from  which  logs  and
          events  are collected. Amazon Security Lake supports logs and events
          collection for natively-supported Amazon Web Services services.

          (tagged union structure)
              The supported source types from which logs and events  are  col-
              lected in Amazon Security Lake.

              NOTE:
                 This  is  a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following
                 top level keys can be set: awsSourceType, customSourceType.

              awsSourceType -> (string)
                 Amazon Security Lake supports logs and events collection  for
                 natively-supported Amazon Web Services services. For more in-
                 formation, see the Amazon Security Lake User Guide.

              customSourceType -> (string)
                 Amazon Security Lake supports custom source  types.  For  the
                 detailed list, see the Amazon Security Lake User Guide.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          awsSourceType=string,customSourceType=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "awsSourceType": "ROUTE53"|"VPC_FLOW"|"CLOUD_TRAIL"|"SH_FINDINGS",
              "customSourceType": "string"
            }

          The name of your Amazon Security Lake subscriber account.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
