          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Security Lake  resource
          for which you want to retrieve the tags.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list tags for an existing resource

       The  following list-tags-for-resource example lists tags for the speci-
       fied Amazon Security Lake subscriber. In this example,  the  Owner  tag
       key doesn't have an associated tag value. You can use this operation to
       list tags for other existing Security Lake resources as well.

          aws securitylake list-tags-for-resource \
              --resource-arn "arn:aws:securitylake:us-east-1:123456789012:subscriber/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

       Output:

          {
              "tags": [
                  {
                      "key": "Environment",
                      "value": "Cloud"
                  },
                  {
                      "key": "CostCenter",
                      "value": "12345"
                  },
                  {
                      "key": "Owner",
                      "value": ""
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       tags -> (list)
          An  array of objects, one for each tag (key and value) thats associ-
          ated with the Amazon Security Lake resource.

          (structure)
              A tag is a label that you can define and associate  with  Amazon
              Web  Services resources, including certain types of Amazon Secu-
              rity Lake resources. Tags can help you identify, categorize, and
              manage  resources  in different ways, such as by owner, environ-
              ment, or other criteria. You can associate tags with the follow-
              ing  types of Security Lake resources: subscribers, and the data
              lake configuration for your Amazon Web Services account in indi-
              vidual Amazon Web Services Regions.

              A  resource  can  have up to 50 tags. Each tag consists of a re-
              quired tag key and an associated tag value . A tag key is a gen-
              eral  label  that  acts  as  a  category for a more specific tag
              value. Each tag key must be unique and it can have only one  tag
              value.  A tag value acts as a descriptor for a tag key. Tag keys
              and values are case sensitive. They can  contain  letters,  num-
              bers, spaces, or the following symbols: _ . : / = + @ -

              For more information, see Tagging Amazon Security Lake resources
              in the Amazon Security Lake User Guide .

              key -> (string)
                 The name of the tag. This is a general label that acts  as  a
                 category for a more specific tag value (value ).

              value -> (string)
                 The value thats associated with the specified tag key (key ).
                 This value acts as a descriptor for the tag key. A tag  value
                 cannot be null, but it can be an empty string.
