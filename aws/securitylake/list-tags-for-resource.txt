OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Security Lake  resource
          for which you want to retrieve the tags.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,

OUTPUT
       tags -> (list)
          An array of objects, one for each tag (key and value) thats  associ-
          ated with the Amazon Security Lake resource.

          (structure)
              A  tag  is a label that you can define and associate with Amazon
              Web Services resources, including certain types of Amazon  Secu-
              rity Lake resources. Tags can help you identify, categorize, and
              manage resources in different ways, such as by  owner,  environ-
              ment, or other criteria. You can associate tags with the follow-
              ing types of Security Lake resources: subscribers, and the  data
              lake configuration for your Amazon Web Services account in indi-
              vidual Amazon Web Services Regions.

              A resource can have up to 50 tags. Each tag consists  of  a  re-
              quired tag key and an associated tag value . A tag key is a gen-
              eral label that acts as a  category  for  a  more  specific  tag
              value.  Each tag key must be unique and it can have only one tag
              value. A tag value acts as a descriptor for a tag key. Tag  keys
              and  values  are  case sensitive. They can contain letters, num-
              bers, spaces, or the following symbols: _ . : / = + @ -

              For more information, see Tagging Amazon Security Lake resources
              in the Amazon Security Lake User Guide .

              key -> (string)
                 The  name  of the tag. This is a general label that acts as a
                 category for a more specific tag value (value ).

              value -> (string)
                 The value thats associated with the specified tag key (key ).
                 This  value acts as a descriptor for the tag key. A tag value
                 cannot be null, but it can be an empty string.
