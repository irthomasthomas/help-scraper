                     eter        of        the        `         CreateDataLake
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDataLake.html`__
                     or                    `                    UpdateDataLake

                     Replication  enables  automatic,  asynchronous copying of

                     configured  for  object  replication  can be owned by the
                     same Amazon Web Services  account  or  by  different  ac-
                     counts. You can replicate objects to a single destination
                     bucket or to multiple destination buckets.  The  destina-
                     tion  buckets  can  be in different Regions or within the
                     same Region as the source bucket.

                     (string)

                 roleArn -> (string)
                     Replication settings for the Amazon S3 buckets. This  pa-
                     rameter  uses  the  Identity  and Access Management (IAM)
                     role you created that is managed by Security Lake, to en-
                     sure the replication setting is correct.

       --meta-store-manager-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) used to create and update the Glue
          table. This table contains partitions generated by the ingestion and
          normalization of Amazon Web Services log sources and custom sources.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
