NAME
       delete-data-lake-organization-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Turns  off  automatic enablement of Amazon Security Lake for member ac-
       counts that are added to an organization  in  Organizations.  Only  the
       delegated  Security  Lake administrator for an organization can perform
       this operation. If the delegated Security Lake  administrator  performs
       this operation, new member accounts won't automatically contribute data
       to the data lake.

       Shorthand Syntax:

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "region": "string",
              "sources": [
                {
                  "sourceName": "ROUTE53"|"VPC_FLOW"|"SH_FINDINGS"|"CLOUD_TRAIL_MGMT"|"LAMBDA_EXECUTION"|"S3_DATA",
                  "sourceVersion": "string"

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
