LIST-USER-ASSOCIATIONS()                              LIST-USER-ASSOCIATIONS()



NAME
       list-user-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists user associations for an identity provider.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-user-associations is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: InstanceUserSummaries

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An array of structures that you can use to  filter  the  results  to
          those  that match one or more sets of key-value pairs that you spec-
          ify.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to  return  more  spe-
              cific  results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to
              match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, at-
              tributes, or IDs.

              Attribute -> (string)
                 The name of an attribute to use as a filter.

              Operation -> (string)
                 The type of search (For example, eq, geq, leq)

              Value -> (string)
                 Value of the filter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Attribute=string,Operation=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Attribute": "string",
              "Operation": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --identity-provider (tagged union structure)
          An object that specifies details for the identity provider.

          NOTE:
              This  is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following top
              level keys can be set: ActiveDirectoryIdentityProvider.

          ActiveDirectoryIdentityProvider -> (structure)
              An object that details an Active Directory identity provider.

              DirectoryId -> (string)
                 The directory ID for an Active Directory identity provider.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ActiveDirectoryIdentityProvider={DirectoryId=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ActiveDirectoryIdentityProvider": {
              "DirectoryId": "string"
            }
          }

       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the EC2 instance, which provides user-based subscriptions.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
