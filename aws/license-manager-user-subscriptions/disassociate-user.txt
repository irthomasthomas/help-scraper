SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-user
          [--domain <value>]
          --identity-provider <value>
          --instance-id <value>
          --username <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The domain name of the user.

       --identity-provider (structure)
          An object that specifies details for the identity provider.

          ActiveDirectoryIdentityProvider -> (structure)
              An object that details an Active Directory identity provider.

              DirectoryId -> (string)
                 The directory ID for an Active Directory identity provider.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ActiveDirectoryIdentityProvider={DirectoryId=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ActiveDirectoryIdentityProvider": {
              "DirectoryId": "string"
            }
          }

       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the EC2 instance, which provides user-based subscriptions.

       --username (string)
          The user name from the identity provider for the user.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
