NAME
       list-product-subscriptions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  user-based subscription products available from an identity
       provider.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-product-subscriptions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: ProductUserSummaries

          [--filters <value>]
          --identity-provider <value>
          --product <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An  array  of  structures  that you can use to filter the results to
          those that match one or more sets of key-value pairs that you  spec-
          ify.

          (structure)
              A  filter  name  and value pair that is used to return more spe-
              cific results from a describe operation. Filters can be used  to
              match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, at-
              tributes, or IDs.

              Attribute -> (string)
                 The name of an attribute to use as a filter.

              Operation -> (string)
                 The type of search (For example, eq, geq, leq)

              Value -> (string)
                 Value of the filter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Attribute=string,Operation=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Attribute": "string",
              "Operation": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --identity-provider (structure)
          An object that specifies details for the identity provider.

          ActiveDirectoryIdentityProvider -> (structure)
              An object that details an Active Directory identity provider.

              DirectoryId -> (string)
                 The directory ID for an Active Directory identity provider.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ActiveDirectoryIdentityProvider={DirectoryId=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ActiveDirectoryIdentityProvider": {
              "DirectoryId": "string"
            }
          }

       --product (string)
          The name of the user-based subscription product.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
