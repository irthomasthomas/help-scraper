MODIFY-INSTANCE-FLEET()                                MODIFY-INSTANCE-FLEET()



NAME
       modify-instance-fleet -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  the  target  On-Demand and target Spot capacities for the in-
       stance fleet with the  specified  InstanceFleetID  within  the  cluster
       specified  using  ClusterID.  The  call either succeeds or fails atomi-
       cally.

       NOTE:
          The instance fleet configuration is available only in Amazon EMR re-
          leases 4.8.0 and later, excluding 5.0.x versions.

OPTIONS
       --cluster-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the cluster.

       --instance-fleet (structure)
          The configuration parameters of the instance fleet.

          InstanceFleetId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the instance fleet.

          TargetOnDemandCapacity -> (integer)
              The  target  capacity of On-Demand units for the instance fleet.
              For more information see   InstanceFleetConfig$TargetOnDemandCa-
              pacity .

          TargetSpotCapacity -> (integer)
              The  target  capacity  of Spot units for the instance fleet. For
              more information, see  InstanceFleetConfig$TargetSpotCapacity .

          ResizeSpecifications -> (structure)
              The resize specification for the instance fleet.

              SpotResizeSpecification -> (structure)
                 The resize specification for Spot Instances in  the  instance
                 fleet, which contains the resize timeout period.

                 TimeoutDurationMinutes -> (integer)
                     Spot resize timeout in minutes. If Spot Instances are not
                     provisioned within this time, the  resize  workflow  will
                     stop  provisioning  of Spot instances. Minimum value is 5
                     minutes and maximum value is 10,080 minutes (7 days). The
                     timeout  applies  to all resize workflows on the Instance
                     Fleet. The resize could be triggered by Amazon  EMR  Man-
                     aged  Scaling or by the customer (via Amazon EMR Console,
                     Amazon EMR CLI modify-instance-fleet or  Amazon  EMR  SDK
                     ModifyInstanceFleet  API)  or by Amazon EMR due to Amazon
                     EC2 Spot Reclamation.

              OnDemandResizeSpecification -> (structure)
                 The resize specification for On-Demand Instances in  the  in-
                 stance fleet, which contains the resize timeout period.

                 TimeoutDurationMinutes -> (integer)
                     On-Demand  resize  timeout  in  minutes. If On-Demand In-
                     stances are not provisioned within this time, the  resize
                     workflow  stops.  The minimum value is 5 minutes, and the
                     maximum value is 10,080 minutes (7 days). The timeout ap-
                     plies  to all resize workflows on the Instance Fleet. The
                     resize could be triggered by Amazon EMR  Managed  Scaling
                     or  by  the  customer (via Amazon EMR Console, Amazon EMR
                     CLI modify-instance-fleet or  Amazon  EMR  SDK  ModifyIn-
                     stanceFleet  API) or by Amazon EMR due to Amazon EC2 Spot
                     Reclamation.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InstanceFleetId=string,TargetOnDemandCapacity=integer,TargetSpotCapacity=integer,ResizeSpecifications={SpotResizeSpecification={TimeoutDurationMinutes=integer},OnDemandResizeSpecification={TimeoutDurationMinutes=integer}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "InstanceFleetId": "string",
            "TargetOnDemandCapacity": integer,
            "TargetSpotCapacity": integer,
            "ResizeSpecifications": {
              "SpotResizeSpecification": {
                "TimeoutDurationMinutes": integer
              },
              "OnDemandResizeSpecification": {
                "TimeoutDurationMinutes": integer
              }
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To change the target capacites of an instance fleet

       This example changes the On-Demand and Spot target capacities to 1  for
       the instance fleet specified.

       Command:

          aws emr modify-instance-fleet --cluster-id 'j-12ABCDEFGHI34JK' --instance-fleet InstanceFleetId='if-2ABC4DEFGHIJ4',TargetOnDemandCapacity=1,TargetSpotCapacity=1

       None
