REMOVE-TAGS()                                                    REMOVE-TAGS()



NAME
       remove-tags -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  tags  from an Amazon EMR resource, such as a cluster or Amazon
       EMR Studio. Tags make it easier to associate resources in various ways,
       such  as grouping clusters to track your Amazon EMR resource allocation
       costs. For more information, see Tag Clusters .

       The following example removes the stack tag  with  value  Prod  from  a
       cluster:

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            remove-tags
          --resource-id <value>
          --tag-keys <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-id (string)
          The  Amazon EMR resource identifier from which tags will be removed.
          For example, a cluster identifier or an Amazon EMR Studio ID.

       --tag-keys (list)
          A list of tag keys to remove from the resource.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command removes a tag with the key prod  from  a  cluster
       with the cluster ID j-3SD91U2E1L2QX:
