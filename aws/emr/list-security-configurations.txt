LIST-SECURITY-CONFIGURATIONS()                  LIST-SECURITY-CONFIGURATIONS()



NAME
       list-security-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all the security configurations visible to this account, provid-
       ing their creation dates and times, and their names. This call  returns
       a  maximum  of  50 clusters per call, but returns a marker to track the
       paging of the cluster list across  multiple  ListSecurityConfigurations
       calls.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-security-configurations  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: SecurityConfigurations

SYNOPSIS
            list-security-configurations
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list security configurations in the current region

       Command:

          aws emr list-security-configurations

       Output:

          {
              "SecurityConfigurations": [
                  {
                      "CreationDateTime": 1473889697.417,
                      "Name": "MySecurityConfig-1"
                  },
                  {
                      "CreationDateTime": 1473889697.417,
                      "Name": "MySecurityConfig-2"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       SecurityConfigurations -> (list)
          The creation date and time, and name, of  each  security  configura-
          tion.

          (structure)
              The  creation  date and time, and name, of a security configura-
              tion.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the security configuration.

              CreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the security configuration was created.

       Marker -> (string)
          A pagination token that indicates the next set  of  results  to  re-
          trieve.  Include  the  marker  in the next ListSecurityConfiguration
          call to retrieve the next page of results, if required.
