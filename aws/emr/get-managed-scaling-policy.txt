OPTIONS
       --cluster-id (string)
          Specifies the ID of the cluster for which the managed scaling policy
          will be fetched.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ManagedScalingPolicy -> (structure)
          Specifies the managed scaling policy that is attached to  an  Amazon
          EMR cluster.

          ComputeLimits -> (structure)
              The  Amazon  EC2  unit  limits for a managed scaling policy. The
              managed scaling activity of a cluster is not allowed to go above
              or  below  these  limits. The limit only applies to the core and
              task nodes. The master node cannot be scaled after initial  con-
              figuration.

              UnitType -> (string)
                 The unit type used for specifying a managed scaling policy.

              MinimumCapacityUnits -> (integer)
                 The  lower  boundary  of  Amazon  EC2  units.  It is measured
                 through vCPU cores or instances for instance groups and  mea-
                 sured  through units for instance fleets. Managed scaling ac-
                 tivities are not allowed beyond this boundary. The limit only
                 applies to the core and task nodes. The master node cannot be
                 scaled after initial configuration.

              MaximumCapacityUnits -> (integer)
                 The upper boundary  of  Amazon  EC2  units.  It  is  measured
                 through  vCPU cores or instances for instance groups and mea-
                 sured through units for instance fleets. Managed scaling  ac-
                 tivities are not allowed beyond this boundary. The limit only
                 applies to the core and task nodes. The master node cannot be
                 scaled after initial configuration.

              MaximumOnDemandCapacityUnits -> (integer)
                 The  upper boundary of On-Demand Amazon EC2 units. It is mea-
                 sured through vCPU cores or instances for instance groups and
                 measured  through  units  for  instance fleets. The On-Demand
                 units are not allowed to scale beyond this boundary. The  pa-
                 rameter  is  used to split capacity allocation between On-De-
                 mand and Spot Instances.

              MaximumCoreCapacityUnits -> (integer)
                 The upper boundary of Amazon EC2 units for core node type  in
                 a cluster. It is measured through vCPU cores or instances for
                 instance groups  and  measured  through  units  for  instance
                 fleets.  The  core units are not allowed to scale beyond this
                 boundary. The parameter is used to split capacity  allocation
                 between core and task nodes.

          UtilizationPerformanceIndex -> (integer)
              An  integer  value that represents an advanced scaling strategy.
              Setting a higher value  optimizes  for  performance.  Setting  a
              lower  value  optimizes  for  resource conservation. Setting the
              value to 50 balances performance and resource conservation. Pos-
              sible values are 1, 25, 50, 75, and 100.

          ScalingStrategy -> (string)
              Determines  whether a custom scaling utilization performance in-
              dex can be set. Possible values include ADVANCED or DEFAULT .
