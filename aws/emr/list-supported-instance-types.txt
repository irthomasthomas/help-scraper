OPTIONS
       --release-label (string)
          The Amazon EMR release label determines the versions of  open-source
          application  packages  that Amazon EMR has installed on the cluster.
          Release labels are in the format emr-x.x.x , where x.x.x is an  Ama-
          zon  EMR  release  number  such as emr-6.10.0 . For more information
          about Amazon EMR releases and their  included  application  versions
          and features, see the * Amazon EMR Release Guide * .

       --marker (string)
          The pagination token that marks the next set of results to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       SupportedInstanceTypes -> (list)
          The  list  of  instance types that the release specified in ListSup-
          portedInstanceTypesInput$ReleaseLabel supports, filtered  by  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

          (structure)
              An instance type that the specified Amazon EMR release supports.

              Type -> (string)
                 The Amazon EC2 instance type , for example m5.xlarge , of the
                 SupportedInstanceType .

              MemoryGB -> (float)
                 The amount of memory that is available to Amazon EMR from the
                 SupportedInstanceType  .  The  kernel and hypervisor software
                 consume some memory, so this value might be  lower  than  the
                 overall memory for the instance type.

              StorageGB -> (integer)
                 StorageGB represents the storage capacity of the SupportedIn-
                 stanceType . This value is 0  for  Amazon  EBS-only  instance
                 types.

              VCPU -> (integer)
                 The number of vCPUs available for the SupportedInstanceType .

              Is64BitsOnly -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  the  SupportedInstanceType  only supports
                 64-bit architecture.

              InstanceFamilyId -> (string)
                 The Amazon EC2 family and  generation  for  the  SupportedIn-
                 stanceType .

              EbsOptimizedAvailable -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  the SupportedInstanceType supports Amazon
                 EBS optimization.

              EbsOptimizedByDefault -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the SupportedInstanceType uses  Amazon  EBS
                 optimization by default.

              NumberOfDisks -> (integer)
                 Number of disks for the SupportedInstanceType . This value is
                 0 for Amazon EBS-only instance types.

              EbsStorageOnly -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether  the  SupportedInstanceType  only  supports
                 Amazon EBS.

              Architecture -> (string)
                 The CPU architecture, for example X86_64 or AARCH64 .

       Marker -> (string)
          The pagination token that marks the next set of results to retrieve.
