OPTIONS
       --notebook-execution-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the notebook execution.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                 cluster.

                 An optional unique ID of an EC2 security group  to  associate
                 with the master instance of the EMR cluster for this notebook
                 execution. For more information see Specifying  EC2  Security
                 Groups for EMR Notebooks in the EMR Management Guide .

          NotebookExecutionName -> (string)
              A name for the notebook execution.

          NotebookParams -> (string)

              runtime for execution.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the notebook execution.

              o START_PENDING indicates that the cluster has received the exe-
                cution request but execution has not begun.

              o STARTING indicates that the execution is starting on the clus-
                ter.

              o RUNNING indicates that the execution is being processed by the
                cluster.

              Guide .

          Tags -> (list)
              A  list  of  tags associated with a notebook execution. Tags are

              string  with  a  maximum of 128 characters and an optional value
              string with a maximum of 256 characters.

                 A key-value pair containing user-defined  metadata  that  you
                 can  associate with an Amazon EMR resource. Tags make it eas-
                 ier to associate clusters in various ways, such  as  grouping
                 clusters  to track your Amazon EMR resource allocation costs.
