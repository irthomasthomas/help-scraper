LIST-STEPS()                                                      LIST-STEPS()



NAME
       list-steps -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  a  list  of steps for the cluster in reverse order unless you
       specify stepIds with the request or filter  by  StepStates  .  You  can
       specify  a  maximum of 10 stepIDs . The CLI automatically paginates re-
       sults to return a list greater than 50 steps. To return  more  than  50
       steps  using  the  CLI,  specify a Marker , which is a pagination token
       that indicates the next set of steps to retrieve.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-steps is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: Steps

OPTIONS
       --cluster-id (string)
          The identifier of the cluster for which to list the steps.

       --step-states (list)
          The filter to limit the step list based on certain states.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            PENDING
            CANCEL_PENDING
            RUNNING
            COMPLETED
            CANCELLED
            FAILED
            INTERRUPTED

       --step-ids (list)
          The  filter  to  limit  the step list based on the identifier of the
          steps. You can specify a maximum of ten Step IDs. The character con-
          straint applies to the overall length of the array.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                        state change.

                     Message -> (string)
                        The descriptive message for the state change reason.

                     The  details  for the step failure including reason, mes-
                     sage, and log file path where the root cause was  identi-
                     fied.

                     Reason -> (string)
                        The reason for the step failure. In the case where the
                        service cannot successfully determine the  root  cause
                        of  the  failure, it returns "Unknown Error" as a rea-
                        son.

                     Message -> (string)
                        The descriptive message including the error the Amazon
                        EMR  service has identified as the cause of step fail-
                        ure. This is text from an error log that describes the
                        root cause of the failure.

                     LogFile -> (string)
                        The  path  to the log file where the step failure root

                        The date and time when the cluster step was created.

                     StartDateTime -> (timestamp)
                        The date and time  when  the  cluster  step  execution
                        started.

                     EndDateTime -> (timestamp)
                        The date and time when the cluster step execution com-
                        pleted or failed.

       Marker -> (string)
          The maximum number of steps that a single ListSteps  action  returns
          is  50. To return a longer list of steps, use multiple ListSteps ac-
          tions along with the Marker parameter, which is a  pagination  token
          that indicates the next set of results to retrieve.
