OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       BlockPublicAccessConfiguration -> (structure)
          A configuration for Amazon EMR block public access.  The  configura-
          tion applies to all clusters created in your account for the current
          Region. The configuration specifies whether block public  access  is
          enabled.  If block public access is enabled, security groups associ-
          ated with the cluster cannot have rules that allow  inbound  traffic
          from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 on a port, unless the port is specified as an
          exception using PermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges in the Block-
          PublicAccessConfiguration  .  By default, Port 22 (SSH) is an excep-
          tion, and public access is allowed on this port. You can change this
          by  updating the block public access configuration to remove the ex-
          ception.

          NOTE:
              For accounts that created clusters in a Region  before  November
              25, 2019, block public access is disabled by default in that Re-
              gion. To use this feature, you must manually enable and  config-
              ure  it.  For accounts that did not create an Amazon EMR cluster
              in a Region before this date, block public access is enabled  by
              default in that Region.

          BlockPublicSecurityGroupRules -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether  Amazon  EMR  block  public access is enabled
              (true ) or disabled (false ). By default, the value is false for
              accounts that have created Amazon EMR clusters before July 2019.
              For accounts created after this, the default is true .

          PermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges -> (list)
              Specifies ports and port ranges that are permitted to have secu-
              rity  group  rules  that  allow  inbound traffic from all public
              sources. For example, if Port 23 (Telnet) is specified for  Per-
              mittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges  , Amazon EMR allows cluster
              creation if a security group associated with the cluster  has  a
              rule  that allows inbound traffic on Port 23 from IPv4 0.0.0.0/0
              or IPv6 port ::/0 as the source.

              By default, Port 22, which is used for SSH access to the cluster
              Amazon EC2 instances, is in the list of PermittedPublicSecurity-
              GroupRuleRanges .

              (structure)
                 A list of port ranges that are  permitted  to  allow  inbound
                 traffic  from  all  public  IP addresses. To specify a single
                 port, use the same value for MinRange and MaxRange .

                 MinRange -> (integer)
                     The smallest port number in a  specified  range  of  port
                     numbers.

                 MaxRange -> (integer)
                     The  smallest  port  number  in a specified range of port
                     numbers.

       BlockPublicAccessConfigurationMetadata -> (structure)
          Properties that describe the Amazon Web Services principal that cre-
          ated  the BlockPublicAccessConfiguration using the PutBlockPublicAc-
          cessConfiguration action as well as the date and time that the  con-
          figuration  was  created. Each time a configuration for block public
          access is updated, Amazon EMR updates this metadata.

          CreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the configuration was created.

          CreatedByArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name that created or last modified the  con-
              figuration.
