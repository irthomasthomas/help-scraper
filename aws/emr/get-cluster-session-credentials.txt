NAME
       get-cluster-session-credentials -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  temporary,  HTTP basic credentials that are associated with a
       given runtime IAM role and used by a cluster with  fine-grained  access
       control  activated. You can use these credentials to connect to cluster
       endpoints that support username and password authentication.

OPTIONS
       --cluster-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the cluster.

       --execution-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the runtime role  for  interactive
          workload  submission  on  the  cluster.  The  runtime  role can be a
          cross-account IAM role. The runtime role ARN is a combination of ac-
          count  ID,  role  name,  and  role  type using the following format:
          arn:partition:service:region:account:resource .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Credentials -> (tagged union structure)
          The  credentials  that  you  can use to connect to cluster endpoints
          that support username and password authentication.

          NOTE:
              This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following  top
              level keys can be set: UsernamePassword.

          UsernamePassword -> (structure)
              The  username  and  password  that you use to connect to cluster
              endpoints.

              Username -> (string)
                 The username associated with the temporary  credentials  that
                 you use to connect to cluster endpoints.

              Password -> (string)
                 The  password  associated with the temporary credentials that
                 you use to connect to cluster endpoints.

       ExpiresAt -> (timestamp)
          The time when the credentials that are returned by the  GetClusterS-
          essionCredentials API expire.
