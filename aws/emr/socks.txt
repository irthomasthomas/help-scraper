DESCRIPTION
       Create a socks tunnel on port 8157 from your machine to the master.

       A value for the variable Key Pair File can be set in the AWS CLI config
       file using the "aws configure set emr.key_pair_file <value>" command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            socks
          --cluster-id <value>
          --key-pair-file <value>

OPTIONS
       --cluster-id (string) Cluster Id of cluster you want to ssh into

       --key-pair-file (string) Private key file to use for login

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command opens a socks connection with the master instance
       in a cluster with the cluster ID j-3SD91U2E1L2QX:

          aws emr socks --cluster-id j-3SD91U2E1L2QX --key-pair-file ~/.ssh/mykey.pem

       The key pair file option takes a local path to a private key file.
