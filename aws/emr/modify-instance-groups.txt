NAME
       modify-instance-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       ModifyInstanceGroups  modifies  the  number  of nodes and configuration
       settings of an instance group. The input  parameters  include  the  new
       target instance count for the group and the instance group ID. The call
       will either succeed or fail atomically.

                     An optional configuration specification to be  used  when
                     provisioning cluster instances, which can include config-
                     urations for applications and software bundled with  Ama-
                     zon  EMR.  A  configuration consists of a classification,
                     properties, and optional nested configurations. A classi-
                     fication  refers to an application-specific configuration
                     file. Properties are the settings you want to  change  in
                     that file. For more information, see Configuring Applica-
                     tions .

                            An optional configuration specification to be used

                            clude configurations for applications and software
                            bundled with Amazon EMR. A configuration  consists
                            of  a  classification,  properties,  and  optional
                            nested configurations. A classification refers  to
                            an  application-specific configuration file. Prop-
                            erties are the settings you want to change in that
                            file. For more information, see Configuring Appli-

                               A set of properties specified within a configu-
                               ration classification.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
