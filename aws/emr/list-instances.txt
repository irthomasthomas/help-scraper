LIST-INSTANCES()                                              LIST-INSTANCES()



NAME
       list-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides information for all active Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon EC2
       instances terminated in the last 30 days, up to  a  maximum  of  2,000.
       Amazon  EC2 instances in any of the following states are considered ac-
       tive: AWAITING_FULFILLMENT, PROVISIONING, BOOTSTRAPPING, RUNNING.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-instances is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Instances

OPTIONS
       --cluster-id (string)
          The identifier of the cluster for which to list the instances.

       --instance-group-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  instance  group  for which to list the in-
          stances.

       --instance-group-types (list)
          The type of instance group for which to list the instances.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            MASTER
            CORE
            TASK

       --instance-fleet-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the instance fleet.

       --instance-fleet-type (string)
          The node type of the instance fleet. For example  MASTER,  CORE,  or
          TASK.

          Possible values:

          o MASTER

          o CORE

          o TASK

       --instance-states (list)
          A  list  of  instance states that will filter the instances returned
          with this request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            AWAITING_FULFILLMENT
            PROVISIONING
            BOOTSTRAPPING
            RUNNING
            TERMINATED

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       cluster ID j-3C6XNQ39VR9WL:
