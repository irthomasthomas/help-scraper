TERMINATE-CLUSTERS()                                      TERMINATE-CLUSTERS()



NAME
       terminate-clusters -

DESCRIPTION
       Shuts down one or more clusters, each specified by cluster ID. Use this
       command only on clusters that do not have  termination  protection  en-
       abled. Clusters with termination protection enabled are not terminated.
       When a cluster is shut down, any step not yet completed is canceled and
       the  Amazon  EC2 instances in the cluster are terminated. Any log files
       not already saved are uploaded to Amazon S3 if a --log-uri  was  speci-
       fied  when  the cluster was created. The maximum number of clusters al-
       lowed in the list is 10. The command is asynchronous. Depending on  the
       configuration  of the cluster, it may take from 5 to 20 minutes for the
       cluster to terminate completely and release allocated resources such as
       Amazon EC2 instances.
