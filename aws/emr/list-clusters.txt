LIST-CLUSTERS()                                                LIST-CLUSTERS()



NAME
       list-clusters -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides the status of all clusters visible to this Amazon Web Services
       account. Allows you to filter the list of  clusters  based  on  certain
       criteria;  for  example, filtering by cluster creation date and time or
       by status. This call returns a maximum of 50 clusters in unsorted order
       per  call, but returns a marker to track the paging of the cluster list
       across multiple ListClusters calls.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-clusters is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Clusters

OPTIONS
       --created-after (timestamp)
          List  only  those clusters created after the date and time specified
          in the  format  yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.  For  example,  --created-after
          2017-07-04T00:01:30.

       --created-before (timestamp)
          List  only those clusters created before the date and time specified
          in the format  yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.  For  example,  --created-before
          2017-07-04T00:01:30.

       --cluster-states (string)
          Specifies that only clusters in the states specified are listed. Al-
          ternatively, you can use the shorthand form for single states  or  a
          group of states.

          Takes the following state values:

          o STARTING

          o BOOTSTRAPPING

          o RUNNING

          o WAITING

          o TERMINATING

          o TERMINATED

          o TERMINATED_WITH_ERRORS

       --active | --terminated | --failed (boolean)
          Shortcut  options  for  --cluster-states. The following shortcut op-
          tions can be specified:

          o --active - list only clusters that are STARTING ,``BOOTSTRAPPING``
            , RUNNING , WAITING , or TERMINATING .

          o --terminated - list only clusters that are TERMINATED .

          o --failed - list only clusters that are TERMINATED_WITH_ERRORS .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                        The creation date and time of the cluster.

                     ReadyDateTime -> (timestamp)
                        The  date  and  time when the cluster was ready to run
                        steps.

                     A list of tuples that provides information about the  er-
                     rors  that  caused a cluster to terminate. This structure
                     can contain up to 10 different ErrorDetail tuples.

                     (structure)
                        A tuple that provides information about an error  that

                 An approximation of the cost of the cluster,  represented  in
                 m1.small/hours.  This value is incremented one time for every
                 hour an m1.small instance runs. Larger instances are weighted
                 more,  so  an  Amazon EC2 instance that is roughly four times
                 more expensive would result in the normalized instance  hours
                 being  incremented by four. This result is only an approxima-
                 tion and does not reflect the actual billing rate.

                 ter is launched.

       Marker -> (string)
          The  pagination  token that indicates the next set of results to re-
          trieve.
