DESCRIPTION
       Use  CloudWatch  Application Signals for comprehensive observability of
       your cloud-based applications.  It  enables  real-time  service  health
       dashboards  and  helps  you  track long-term performance trends against
       your business goals. The application-centric  view  provides  you  with
       unified  visibility  across  your applications, services, and dependen-
       cies, so you can proactively monitor and efficiently triage any  issues
       that may arise, ensuring optimal customer experience.

       Application Signals provides the following benefits:

       o Automatically  collect metrics and traces from your applications, and
         display key metrics  such  as  call  volume,  availability,  latency,
         faults, and errors.

       o Create and monitor service level objectives (SLOs).

       o See a map of your application topology that Application Signals auto-
         matically discovers, that gives you a visual representation  of  your
         applications, dependencies, and their connectivity.

       Application  Signals  works  with CloudWatch RUM, CloudWatch Synthetics
       canaries, and Amazon Web Services Service Catalog AppRegistry, to  dis-
       play  your  client  pages,  Synthetics  canaries, and application names
       within dashboards and maps.
