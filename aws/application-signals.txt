       Use  CloudWatch  Application Signals for comprehensive observability of
       your cloud-based applications.  It  enables  real-time  service  health
       dashboards  and  helps  you  track long-term performance trends against

       cies, so you can proactively monitor and efficiently triage any  issues
       that may arise, ensuring optimal customer experience.

       Application Signals provides the following benefits:

         display key metrics  such  as  call  volume,  availability,  latency,
         faults, and errors.

       o Create and monitor service level objectives (SLOs).

       o See a map of your application topology that Application Signals auto-
         matically discovers, that gives you a visual representation  of  your
         applications, dependencies, and their connectivity.
