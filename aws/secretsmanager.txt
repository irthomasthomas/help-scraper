          Logging API Requests

       Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager supports Amazon Web Services Cloud-
       Trail, a service that records Amazon Web Services API  calls  for  your
       Amazon  Web  Services  account  and  delivers log files to an Amazon S3
       bucket. By using information that's collected by  Amazon  Web  Services
       CloudTrail, you can determine the requests successfully made to Secrets
       Manager, who made the request, when it was made, and so  on.  For  more
