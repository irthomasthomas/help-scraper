DESCRIPTION
       Welcome to the Amazon Web Services Clean Rooms ML API Reference .

       Amazon  Web Services Clean Rooms ML provides a privacy-enhancing method
       for two parties to identify similar users in  their  data  without  the
       need  to  share  their data with each other. The first party brings the
       training data to Clean Rooms so that they can create and  configure  an
       audience model (lookalike model) and associate it with a collaboration.
       The second party then brings their seed data to Clean Rooms and  gener-
       ates an audience (lookalike segment) that resembles the training data.

       To learn more about Amazon Web Services Clean Rooms ML concepts, proce-
       dures, and best practices, see the Clean Rooms User Guide .
