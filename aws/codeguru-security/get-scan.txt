OPTIONS
       --run-id (string)
          UUID that identifies the individual scan run you want  to  view  de-
          tails  about.  You retrieve this when you call the CreateScan opera-
          tion. Defaults to the latest scan run if missing.

       --scan-name (string)
          The name of the scan you want to view details about.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)
