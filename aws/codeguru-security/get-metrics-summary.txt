OPTIONS
       --date (timestamp)
          The date you want to retrieve summary metrics from, rounded  to  the
          nearest  day.  The date must be within the past two years since met-
          rics data is only stored for two years. If a date  outside  of  this
          range is passed, the response will be empty.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT

          The summary metrics from the specified date.

          categoriesWithMostFindings -> (list)
              A list of CategoryWithFindingNum objects for the top  5  finding
              categories with the most open findings in an account.

                 categoryName -> (string)
                     The  name  of the finding category. A finding category is

                     The number of open findings in the category.

              trieved.

              The number of open findings of each severity in an account.

              critical -> (double)
                 The  severity  of  the  finding is critical and should be ad-
                 dressed immediately.

              high -> (double)
                 The severity of the finding is high and should  be  addressed
                 as a near-term priority.

              info -> (double)
                 The finding is related to quality or readability improvements
                 and not considered actionable.

              low -> (double)
                 The severity of the finding is low and does require action on
                 its own.

              medium -> (double)
                 The severity of the finding is medium and should be addressed
                 as a mid-term priority.

          scansWithMostOpenCriticalFindings -> (list)
              A list of ScanNameWithFindingNum objects for  the  top  3  scans
              with the most number of open findings in an account.

              (structure)
                 Information about a scan with open findings.

                 findingNumber -> (integer)
                     The number of open findings generated by a scan.

                 scanName -> (string)
                     The name of the scan.

          scansWithMostOpenFindings -> (list)
              A  list  of  ScanNameWithFindingNum  objects for the top 3 scans
              with the most number of open critical findings in an account.

              (structure)
                 Information about a scan with open findings.

                 findingNumber -> (integer)
                     The number of open findings generated by a scan.

                 scanName -> (string)
