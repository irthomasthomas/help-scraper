NAME
       create-upload-url -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  a  pre-signed URL, request headers used to upload a code re-
       source, and code artifact identifier for the uploaded resource.

       You can upload your code resource to the URL with the  request  headers
       using any HTTP client.

OPTIONS
       --scan-name (string)
          The  name  of the scan that will use the uploaded resource. CodeGuru
          Security uses the unique scan name to track revisions across  multi-
          ple scans of the same resource. Use this scanName when you call Cre-
          ateScan on the code resource you upload to this URL.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       codeArtifactId -> (string)
          The identifier for the uploaded code resource. Pass this to CreateS-
          can to use the uploaded resources.

       requestHeaders -> (map)
          A  set of key-value pairs that contain the required headers when up-
          loading your resource.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       s3Url -> (string)
          A pre-signed S3 URL. You can upload the code file you want  to  scan
          with the required requestHeaders using any HTTP client.
