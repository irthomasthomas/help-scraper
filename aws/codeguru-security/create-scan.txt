OPTIONS
       --analysis-type (string)
          The  type  of  analysis you want CodeGuru Security to perform in the
          scan, either Security or All .  The  Security  type  only  generates
          findings  related  to security. The All type generates both security
          findings and quality findings. Defaults to Security type if missing.

          Possible values:

          o Security

          o All

       --client-token (string)
          The idempotency token for the request. Amazon CodeGuru Security uses
          this  value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate scans if
          there are failures and retries.

       --resource-id (tagged union structure)
          The identifier for the resource object to be scanned.

          NOTE:
              This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following  top
              level keys can be set: codeArtifactId.

          codeArtifactId -> (string)
              The  identifier  for  the code file uploaded to the resource ob-
              ject. Returned by CreateUploadUrl when you upload  resources  to
              be scanned.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          codeArtifactId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "codeArtifactId": "string"
          }

       --scan-name (string)
          The  unique  name  that  CodeGuru  Security  uses to track revisions
          across multiple scans of the same resource. Only allowed for a STAN-
          DARD scan type.

       --scan-type (string)
          The  type of scan, either Standard or Express . Defaults to Standard
          type if missing.
              Express scans run on limited resources and use a limited set  of
              detectors to analyze your code in near-real time. Standard scans
              have standard resource limits and use the full set of  detectors
              to analyze your code.

          Possible values:

          o Standard

          o Express

       --tags (map)
          An  array  of  key-value pairs used to tag a scan. A tag is a custom
          attribute label with two parts:

          o A tag key. For example, CostCenter , Environment , or Secret . Tag
            keys are case sensitive.

          o An  optional  tag value field. For example, 111122223333 , Produc-
            tion , or a team name. Omitting the tag value is the same as using
            an empty string. Tag values are case sensitive.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       resourceId -> (tagged union structure)
          The identifier for the resource object that contains resources  that
          were scanned.

          NOTE:
              This  is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following top
              level keys can be set: codeArtifactId.

          codeArtifactId -> (string)
              The identifier for the code file uploaded to  the  resource  ob-
              ject.  Returned  by CreateUploadUrl when you upload resources to
              be scanned.

       runId -> (string)
          UUID that identifies the individual scan run.

       scanName -> (string)
          The name of the scan.

       scanNameArn -> (string)
          The ARN for the scan name.

       scanState -> (string)
          The current state of the scan. Returns either InProgress ,  Success-
