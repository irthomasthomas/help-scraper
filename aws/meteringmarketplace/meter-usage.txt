METER-USAGE()                                                    METER-USAGE()



NAME
       meter-usage -

DESCRIPTION
       API  to emit metering records. For identical requests, the API is idem-
       potent. It simply returns the metering record ID.
          MeterUsage is authenticated on the buyer's AWS account using creden-
          tials from the EC2 instance, ECS task, or EKS pod.

          MeterUsage  can  optionally  include  multiple usage allocations, to
          provide customers with usage data split into buckets  by  tags  that
          you define (or allow the customer to define).

       Usage records are expected to be submitted as quickly as possible after
       the event that is being recorded, and are  not  accepted  more  than  6
       hours after the event.

OPTIONS
       --product-code (string)
          Product  code  is used to uniquely identify a product in AWS Market-
          place. The product code should be the same as the  one  used  during
          the publishing of a new product.

       --timestamp (timestamp)
          Timestamp,  in  UTC, for which the usage is being reported. Your ap-
          plication can meter usage for up to one hour in the past. Make  sure
          the timestamp value is not before the start of the software usage.

       --usage-dimension (string)
          It  will  be  one of the fcp dimension name provided during the pub-
          lishing of the product.

       --usage-quantity (integer)
          Consumption value for the hour. Defaults to 0 if not specified.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the permissions required for the action, but
          does  not make the request. If you have the permissions, the request
          returns DryRunOperation ; otherwise, it  returns  UnauthorizedExcep-
          tion . Defaults to false if not specified.

       --usage-allocations (list)
          The set of UsageAllocations to submit.

          The  sum of all UsageAllocation quantities must equal the UsageQuan-
          tity of the MeterUsage request, and each UsageAllocation must have a
          unique set of tags (include no tags).

          (structure)
              Usage allocations allow you to split usage into buckets by tags.

              Each UsageAllocation indicates the usage quantity for a specific
              set of tags.

              AllocatedUsageQuantity -> (integer)
                 The total quantity allocated to this bucket of usage.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The set of tags that define the  bucket  of  usage.  For  the
                 bucket of items with no tags, this parameter can be left out.

                 (structure)
                     Metadata  assigned  to an allocation. Each tag is made up
                     of a key and a value .

                     Key -> (string)
                        One part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag  .  A
                        key  is a label that acts like a category for the spe-
                        cific tag values.

                     Value -> (string)
                        One part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag  .  A
                        value  acts  as  a  descriptor  within  a tag category
                        (key). The value can be empty or null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AllocatedUsageQuantity=integer,Tags=[{Key=string,Value=string},{Key=string,Value=string}] ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "AllocatedUsageQuantity": integer,
              "Tags": [
                {
                  "Key": "string",
                  "Value": "string"
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
