CREATE-DIRECT-CONNECT-GATEWAY-ASSOCCREATE-DIRECT-CONNECT-GATEWAY-ASSOCIATION()



NAME
       create-direct-connect-gateway-association -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  association between a Direct Connect gateway and a virtual
       private gateway. The virtual private gateway must be attached to a  VPC
       and must not be associated with another Direct Connect gateway.

OPTIONS
       --direct-connect-gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the Direct Connect gateway.

       --gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the virtual private gateway or transit gateway.

       --add-allowed-prefixes-to-direct-connect-gateway (list)
          The Amazon VPC prefixes to advertise to the Direct Connect gateway

          This parameter is required when you create an association to a tran-
          sit gateway.

          For information about how to set the prefixes, see Allowed  Prefixes
          in the Direct Connect User Guide .

          (structure)
              Information  about a route filter prefix that a customer can ad-
              vertise through Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) over a public vir-
              tual interface.

              cidr -> (string)
                 The  CIDR  block  for the advertised route. Separate multiple
                 routes using commas. An IPv6 CIDR must use /64 or shorter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          cidr=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "cidr": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --virtual-gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the virtual private gateway.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To associate a virtual private gateway with a Direct Connect gateway

       The following example associates virtual private  gateway  vgw-6efe725e
       with  Direct  Connect  gateway 5f294f92-bafb-4011-916d-9b0bexample. You
       must run the command in the region in which the virtual private gateway
       is located.

       Command:

          aws directconnect create-direct-connect-gateway-association --direct-connect-gateway-id 5f294f92-bafb-4011-916d-9b0bexample --virtual-gateway-id vgw-6efe725e

       Output:

          {
            "directConnectGatewayAssociation": {
                "associationState": "associating",
                "virtualGatewayOwnerAccount": "123456789012",
                "directConnectGatewayId": "5f294f92-bafb-4011-916d-9b0bexample",
                "virtualGatewayId": "vgw-6efe725e",
