CREATE-CONNECTION()                                        CREATE-CONNECTION()



NAME
       create-connection -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  connection between a customer network and a specific Direct
       Connect location.

       A connection links your internal network to an Direct Connect  location
       over  a  standard  Ethernet  fiber-optic cable. One end of the cable is
       connected to your router, the other to an Direct Connect router.

       To find the locations for your Region, use  DescribeLocations .

       You can automatically add the new  connection  to  a  link  aggregation
       group  (LAG)  by  specifying a LAG ID in the request. This ensures that
       the new connection is allocated on the  same  Direct  Connect  endpoint
       that  hosts  the  specified LAG. If there are no available ports on the
       endpoint, the request fails and no connection is created.

                 The key.

              value -> (string)
                 The value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --provider-name (string)
          The name of the service provider associated with the requested  con-
          nection.

       --request-mac-sec | --no-request-mac-sec (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  you  want the connection to support MAC Security
          (MACsec).

          MAC Security (MACsec) is only available  on  dedicated  connections.
          For  information  about  MAC  Security  (MACsec)  prerequisties, see
          MACsec prerequisties in the Direct Connect User Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
