CONFIRM-CONNECTION()                                      CONFIRM-CONNECTION()



NAME
       confirm-connection -

DESCRIPTION
       Confirms  the  creation of the specified hosted connection on an inter-
       connect.

       Upon creation, the hosted  connection  is  initially  in  the  Ordering
       state,  and  remains in this state until the owner confirms creation of
       the hosted connection.

SYNOPSIS
            confirm-connection
          --connection-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --connection-id (string)
          The ID of the hosted connection.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To confirm the creation of a hosted connection on an interconnect

       The following confirm-connection command confirms  the  creation  of  a
       hosted connection on an interconnect:

          aws directconnect confirm-connection --connection-id dxcon-fg2wi7hy

       Output:

          {
              "connectionState": "pending"
          }

OUTPUT
       connectionState -> (string)
          The state of the connection. The following are the possible values:

          o ordering : The initial state of a hosted connection provisioned on
            an interconnect. The connection stays in the ordering state  until
            the  owner  of the hosted connection confirms or declines the con-
            nection order.

          o requested : The initial state of a standard connection.  The  con-
            nection  stays  in  the requested state until the Letter of Autho-
            rization (LOA) is sent to the customer.

          o pending : The connection has been approved and is  being  initial-
            ized.

          o available : The network link is up and the connection is ready for
            use.

          o down : The network link is down.

          o deleting : The connection is being deleted.

          o deleted : The connection has been deleted.

          o rejected : A hosted connection in the ordering  state  enters  the
            rejected state if it is deleted by the customer.

          o unknown : The state of the connection is not available.
