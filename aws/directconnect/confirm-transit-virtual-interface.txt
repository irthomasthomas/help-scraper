       Amazon Web Services account.

       specified  transit  virtual  interface is created and made available to
       handle traffic.

OPTIONS
       --virtual-interface-id (string)
          The ID of the virtual interface.

       --direct-connect-gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the Direct Connect gateway.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To accept ownership of a transit virtual interface

       The following confirm-transit-virtual-interface accepts ownership of  a
       transit virtual interface created by another customer.

          aws directconnect confirm-transit-virtual-interface \
              --virtual-interface-id dxvif-fEXAMPLE \
              --direct-connect-gateway-id 4112ccf9-25e9-4111-8237-b6c5dEXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "virtualInterfaceState": "pending"
          }

       For  more  information, see Accepting a Hosted Virtual Interface in the
       AWS Direct Connect User Guide.

OUTPUT
       virtualInterfaceState -> (string)
          The state of the virtual interface. The following are  the  possible
          values:

          o confirming : The creation of the virtual interface is pending con-
            firmation from the virtual interface owner. If the  owner  of  the
            virtual interface is different from the owner of the connection on
            which it is provisioned, then the virtual interface will remain in
            this state until it is confirmed by the virtual interface owner.

          o verifying  : This state only applies to public virtual interfaces.
            Each public virtual interface needs validation before the  virtual
            interface can be created.

          o pending  : A virtual interface is in this state from the time that
            it is created until the virtual  interface  is  ready  to  forward
            traffic.

          o available : A virtual interface that is able to forward traffic.

          o down : A virtual interface that is BGP down.

          o deleting  : A virtual interface is in this state immediately after
            calling  DeleteVirtualInterface until it  can  no  longer  forward
            traffic.

          o deleted : A virtual interface that cannot forward traffic.

          o rejected  :  The  virtual interface owner has declined creation of
            the virtual interface. If a virtual interface  in  the  Confirming
            state  is  deleted by the virtual interface owner, the virtual in-
            terface enters the Rejected state.

          o unknown : The state of the virtual interface is not available.
