ASSOCIATE-VIRTUAL-INTERFACE()                    ASSOCIATE-VIRTUAL-INTERFACE()



NAME
       associate-virtual-interface -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  a virtual interface with a specified link aggregation group
       (LAG) or connection. Connectivity to Amazon Web Services is temporarily
       interrupted  as  the virtual interface is being migrated. If the target
       connection or LAG has an associated virtual interface with a  conflict-
       ing VLAN number or a conflicting IP address, the operation fails.

       Virtual  interfaces associated with a hosted connection cannot be asso-
       ciated with a LAG; hosted connections must be migrated along with their
       virtual interfaces using  AssociateHostedConnection .

       To  reassociate a virtual interface to a new connection or LAG, the re-
       quester must own either the virtual interface itself or the  connection
       to  which  the virtual interface is currently associated. Additionally,
       the requester must own the connection or LAG for the association.

OPTIONS
       --virtual-interface-id (string)
          The ID of the virtual interface.

       --connection-id (string)
          The ID of the LAG or connection.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To associate a virtual interface with a connection

       The  following  example associates the specified virtual interface with
       the specified LAG. Alternatively, to associate  the  virtual  interface
       with  a  connection, specify the ID of an AWS Direct Connect connection
       for --connection-id; for example, dxcon-ffnikghc.

       Command:

          aws directconnect associate-virtual-interface --connection-id dxlag-ffjhj9lx --virtual-interface-id dxvif-fgputw0j

          values:

          o confirming : The creation of the virtual interface is pending con-
            firmation from the virtual interface owner. If the  owner  of  the
            virtual interface is different from the owner of the connection on
            which it is provisioned, then the virtual interface will remain in
            this state until it is confirmed by the virtual interface owner.

          o verifying  : This state only applies to public virtual interfaces.
            Each public virtual interface needs validation before the  virtual
            interface can be created.

          o pending  : A virtual interface is in this state from the time that
            it is created until the virtual  interface  is  ready  to  forward
            traffic.

          o available : A virtual interface that is able to forward traffic.

          o down : A virtual interface that is BGP down.

          o deleting  : A virtual interface is in this state immediately after
            calling  DeleteVirtualInterface until it  can  no  longer  forward
            traffic.

          o deleted : A virtual interface that cannot forward traffic.

          o rejected  :  The  virtual interface owner has declined creation of
            the virtual interface. If a virtual interface  in  the  Confirming
            state  is  deleted by the virtual interface owner, the virtual in-
            terface enters the Rejected state.

          o unknown : The state of the virtual interface is not available.

          The customer router configuration.

       mtu -> (integer)

              vertise through Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) over a public vir-
              tual interface.

              cidr -> (string)
                 The  CIDR  block  for the advertised route. Separate multiple
                 routes using commas. An IPv6 CIDR must use /64 or shorter.

                 values:

                 o verifying : The BGP peering addresses or ASN require  vali-
                   dation  before  the BGP peer can be created. This state ap-
