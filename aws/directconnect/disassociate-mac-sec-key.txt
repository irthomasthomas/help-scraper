OPTIONS
       --connection-id (string)
          The ID of the dedicated connection (dxcon-xxxx), or the  ID  of  the
          LAG (dxlag-xxxx).

          You  can  use  DescribeConnections or  DescribeLags to retrieve con-
          nection ID.

       --secret-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the MAC Security  (MACsec)  secret
          key.

          You  can use  DescribeConnections to retrieve the ARN of the MAC Se-
          curity (MACsec) secret key.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       connectionId -> (string)
          The ID of the dedicated connection (dxcon-xxxx), or the  ID  of  the
          LAG (dxlag-xxxx).

       macSecKeys -> (list)
          The  MAC  Security  (MACsec) security keys no longer associated with
          the dedicated connection.

          (structure)
              Information about the MAC Security (MACsec) secret key.

              secretARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the MAC  Security  (MACsec)
                 secret key.

              ckn -> (string)
                 The  Connection  Key  Name  (CKN) for the MAC Security secret
                 key.

              state -> (string)
                 The state of the MAC Security (MACsec) secret key.

                 The possible values are:

                 o associating : The MAC Security (MACsec) secret key is being
                   validated  and  not  yet  associated with the connection or
                   LAG.

                 o associated : The MAC Security (MACsec) secret key is  vali-
                   dated and associated with the connection or LAG.

                 o disassociating  :  The  MAC Security (MACsec) secret key is
                   being disassociated from the connection or LAG

                 o disassociated : The MAC Security (MACsec) secret key is  no
                   longer associated with the connection or LAG.

              startOn -> (string)
                 The  date that the MAC Security (MACsec) secret key takes ef-
                 fect. The value is displayed in UTC format.
