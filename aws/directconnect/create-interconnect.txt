CREATE-INTERCONNECT()                                    CREATE-INTERCONNECT()



NAME
       create-interconnect -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an interconnect between an Direct Connect Partner's network and
       a specific Direct Connect location.

       An interconnect is a connection that is capable of hosting  other  con-
       nections. The Direct Connect Partner can use an interconnect to provide
       Direct Connect hosted connections to customers through their  own  net-
       work  services.  Like  a standard connection, an interconnect links the
       partner's network to an Direct Connect location over a standard  Ether-
       net  fiber-optic  cable.  One end is connected to the partner's router,
       the other to an Direct Connect router.

       You can automatically add the new interconnect to  a  link  aggregation
       group  (LAG)  by  specifying a LAG ID in the request. This ensures that
       the new interconnect is allocated on the same Direct  Connect  endpoint
       that  hosts  the  specified LAG. If there are no available ports on the
       endpoint, the request fails and no interconnect is created.

       For each end customer, the Direct Connect Partner provisions a  connec-
       tion  on  their interconnect by calling  AllocateHostedConnection . The
       end customer can then connect to Amazon Web Services resources by  cre-
       ating  a virtual interface on their connection, using the VLAN assigned
       to them by the Direct Connect Partner.

       NOTE:
          Intended for use by Direct Connect Partners only.

OPTIONS
       --interconnect-name (string)
          The name of the interconnect.

       --bandwidth (string)
          The port bandwidth, in Gbps. The possible values are 1 and 10.

       --location (string)
          The location of the interconnect.

       --lag-id (string)
          The ID of the LAG.

       --tags (list)
          The tags to associate with the interconnect.

          (structure)
              Information about a tag.

              key -> (string)
                 The key.

              value -> (string)
                 The value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --provider-name (string)
          The name of the service provider associated with the interconnect.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
