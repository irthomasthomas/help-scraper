NAME
       update-layout -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the attributes of an existing layout.

       If  the  action  is  successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 re-
       sponse with an empty HTTP body.

       A ValidationException is returned when you add non-existent fieldIds to
       a layout.

       NOTE:
          Title  and  Status fields cannot be part of layouts because they are
          not configurable.
