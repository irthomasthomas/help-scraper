          The unique identifier of the Cases domain.

       --name (string)
          The name of the layout. It must be unique for the Cases domain.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not

       the string will be taken literally.

       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
