SEARCH-RELATED-ITEMS()                                  SEARCH-RELATED-ITEMS()



NAME
       search-related-items -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches for related items that are associated with a case.

       NOTE:
          If  no  filters are provided, this returns all related items associ-
          ated with a case.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       search-related-items is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: relatedItems

OPTIONS
       --case-id (string)
          A unique identifier of the case.

       --domain-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the Cases domain.

       --filters (list)
          The  list  of types of related items and their parameters to use for

          (tagged union structure)
              The list of types of related items and their parameters  to  use
              for filtering.

              NOTE:
                 This  is  a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following
                 top level keys can be set: comment, contact, file.

              comment -> (structure)
                 A filter for related items of type Comment .

              contact -> (structure)
                 A filter for related items of type Contact .

                 channel -> (list)
                     A list of channels to filter on for related items of type
                     Contact .

                     (string)

                 contactArn -> (string)
                     A unique identifier of a contact in Amazon Connect.

              file -> (structure)
                 A filter for related items of this type of File .

                 fileArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the file.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          comment={},contact={channel=[string,string],contactArn=string},file={fileArn=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "comment": {

              },
              "contact": {
                "channel": ["string", ...],
                "contactArn": "string"
              },
              "file": {
                "fileArn": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
