UPDATE-INDEX-TYPE()                                        UPDATE-INDEX-TYPE()



NAME
       update-index-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Changes  the  type  of the index from one of the following types to the
       other. For more information about indexes and the role they perform  in
       Amazon  Web  Services  Resource  Explorer,  see Turning on cross-Region
       search by creating an aggregator index in the Amazon Web  Services  Re-
       source Explorer User Guide .

       o ``AGGREGATOR``  index type   The index contains information about re-
         sources from all Amazon Web Services Regions in the Amazon  Web  Ser-
         vices  account in which you've created a Resource Explorer index. Re-
         source information from all other Regions is replicated to  this  Re-
         gion's index. When you change the index type to AGGREGATOR , Resource
         Explorer turns on replication of all discovered resource  information
         from  the  other  Amazon Web Services Regions in your account to this
         index. You can then, from this Region only, perform  resource  search
         queries  that  span all Amazon Web Services Regions in the Amazon Web
         Services account. Turning on replication from all  other  Regions  is
         performed  by asynchronous background tasks. You can check the status
         of the asynchronous tasks by using the  GetIndex operation. When  the
         asynchronous  tasks  complete,  the Status response of that operation
         changes from UPDATING to ACTIVE . After that, you can  start  to  see
         results from other Amazon Web Services Regions in query results. How-
         ever, it can take several hours for replication from  all  other  Re-
         gions to complete.

       WARNING:
          You  can  have only one aggregator index per Amazon Web Services ac-
          count. Before you can promote a different index to be the aggregator
          index for the account, you must first demote the existing aggregator
          index to type LOCAL .

       o ``LOCAL`` index type   The index contains information about resources
         in  only the Amazon Web Services Region in which the index exists. If
         an aggregator index in another Region  exists,  then  information  in
         this  local  index  is  replicated  to the aggregator index. When you
         change the index type to LOCAL ,  Resource  Explorer  turns  off  the
         replication  of  resource  information from all other Amazon Web Ser-
         vices Regions in the Amazon Web Services account to this Region.  The
         aggregator  index remains in the UPDATING state until all replication
         with other Regions successfully stops. You can check  the  status  of
         the asynchronous task by using the  GetIndex operation. When Resource
         Explorer successfully stops all replication with other  Regions,  the
         Status  response  of that operation changes from UPDATING to ACTIVE .
         Separately, the resource information from other Regions that was pre-
         viously  stored  in  the  index  is deleted within 30 days by another
         background task. Until that asynchronous task completes, some results
         from other Regions can continue to appear in search results.

       WARNING:
          After you demote an aggregator index to a local index, you must wait
          24 hours before you can promote another index to be the new aggrega-
          tor index for the account.

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the index that you want to update.

       --type (string)
          The  type  of  the index. To understand the difference between LOCAL
          and AGGREGATOR , see Turning on cross-Region search  in  the  Amazon
          Web Services Resource Explorer User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o LOCAL

          o AGGREGATOR

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To change the type of a Resource Explorer index

       The  following  update-index-type  example converts the specified index
       from type local to type aggregator to turn on the ability to search for
       resources  across all AWS Regions in the account. You must send the re-
       quest to the AWS Region that contains the index you want to update.

          aws resource-explorer-2 update-index-type \
              --arn arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-east-1:123456789012:index/EXAMPLE8-90ab-cdef-fedc-EXAMPLE11111 \
              --type aggregator \
              --region us-east-1

       Output:

          {
              "Arn":"arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-east-1:123456789012:index/EXAMPLE8-90ab-cdef-fedc-EXAMPLE11111",
              "LastUpdatedAt":"2022-07-13T18:41:58.799Z",
              "State":"updating",
              "Type":"aggregator"
          }

       For more information about changing an index's  type,  see  Turning  on
       cross-Region search by creating an aggregator index in the AWS Resource
       Explorer Users Guide.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the index that you updated.

       LastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The date and timestamp when the index was last updated.

       State -> (string)
          Indicates the state of the request to update the index. This  opera-
          tion  is  asynchronous.  Call  the   GetIndex operation to check for
          changes.

       Type -> (string)
          Specifies the type of the specified index after the  operation  com-
          pletes.
