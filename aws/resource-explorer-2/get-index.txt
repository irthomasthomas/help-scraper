          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]

          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example  1:  To retrieve the details for a Resource Explorer aggregator
       index

       The following get-index example displays the details for  the  Resource
       Explorer  index  in the specified AWS Region. Because the specified Re-
       gion contains the aggregator index for the account,  the  output  lists
       the Regions that replicate data into this Region's index.

          aws resource-explorer-2 get-index \
              --region us-east-1

       Output:

          {
              "Arn": "arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-east-1:123456789012:index/EXAMPLE8-90ab-cdef-fedc-EXAMPLE11111",
              "CreatedAt": "2022-07-12T18:59:10.503000+00:00",
              "LastUpdatedAt": "2022-07-13T18:41:58.799000+00:00",
              "ReplicatingFrom": [
                  "ap-south-1",
                  "us-west-2"
              ],
              "State": "ACTIVE",
              "Tags": {},
              "Type": "AGGREGATOR"
          }

       Example 2: To retrieve the details for a Resource Explorer local index

       The  following  get-index example displays the details for the Resource
       Explorer index in the specified AWS Region. Because the  specified  Re-
       gion  contains  a  local index, the output lists the Region to which it
       replicates data from this Region's index.

          aws resource-explorer-2 get-index \
              --region us-west-2

       Output:

          {
              "Arn": "arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-west-2:123456789012:index/EXAMPLE8-90ab-cdef-fedc-EXAMPLE22222",
              "CreatedAt": "2022-07-12T18:59:10.503000+00:00",
              "LastUpdatedAt": "2022-07-13T18:41:58.799000+00:00",
              "ReplicatingTo": [
                  "us-west-2"
              ],
              "State": "ACTIVE",
              "Tags": {},
              "Type": "LOCAL"
          }

       Resource Explorer turned on in the AWS Resource Explorer Users Guide.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the index.

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The date and time when the index was originally created.

       LastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The date and time when the index was last updated.

       ReplicatingFrom -> (list)
          This response value is present only if this index is Type=AGGREGATOR
          .

          A list of the Amazon Web Services Regions that replicate their  con-
          tent to the index in this Region.

          (string)

       ReplicatingTo -> (list)
          This response value is present only if this index is Type=LOCAL .

          The  Amazon  Web Services Region that contains the aggregator index,
          if one exists. If an aggregator index does exist then the Region  in
          which  you called this operation replicates its index information to
          the Region specified in this response value.

          (string)

       State -> (string)
          The current state of the index in this Amazon Web Services Region.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Type -> (string)
          The type of the index in this Region. For information about the  ag-
          gregator index and how it differs from a local index, see Turning on
          cross-Region search by creating an aggregator index .
