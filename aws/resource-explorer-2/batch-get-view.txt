OPTIONS
       --view-arns (list)
          A  list  of Amazon resource names (ARNs) that identify the views you
          want details for.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Errors -> (list)
          If any of the specified ARNs result in an error, then this structure
          describes the error.

          (structure)
              A collection of error messages for any  views  that  Amazon  Web
              Services Resource Explorer couldn't retrieve details.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The description of the error for the specified view.

              ViewArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the view for which Resource
                 Explorer failed to retrieve details.

       Views -> (list)
          A structure with a list of objects with  details  for  each  of  the
          specified views.

          (structure)
              A view is a structure that defines a set of filters that provide
              a view into the information in the Amazon Web Services  Resource
              Explorer  index.  The filters specify which information from the
              index is visible to the users of the view. For example, you  can
              specify filters that include only resources that are tagged with
              the key "ENV" and the value "DEVELOPMENT"  in  the  results  re-
              turned  by  this  view. You could also create a second view that
              includes only resources that are tagged with "ENV" and  "PRODUC-
              TION".

              Filters -> (structure)
                 An  array  of   SearchFilter  objects  that specify which re-
                 sources can be included in the results of queries made  using
                 this view.

                 FilterString -> (string)
                     The  string  that contains the search keywords, prefixes,
                     and operators to control the results that can be returned
                     by  a   Search  operation.  For  more details, see Search
                     query syntax .

              IncludedProperties -> (list)
                 A structure that contains additional  information  about  the
                 view.

                 (structure)
                     Information about an additional property that describes a
                     resource, that you can optionally include  in  the  view.
                     This  lets  you view that property in search results, and
                     filter your search results based  on  the  value  of  the
                     property.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the  property  that is included in this
                        view.

                        You can specify the following property names for  this
                        field:

                        o Tags

              LastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when this view was last modified.

              Owner -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account that owns this view.

              Scope -> (string)
                 An  Amazon  resource name (ARN) of an Amazon Web Services ac-
                 count, an organization, or an organizational unit  (OU)  that
                 specifies  whether this view includes resources from only the
                 specified Amazon Web Services account, all  accounts  in  the
                 specified organization, or all accounts in the specified OU.

                 If  not  specified, the value defaults to the Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices account used to call this operation.

              ViewArn -> (string)
