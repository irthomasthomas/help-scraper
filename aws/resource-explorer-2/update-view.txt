OPTIONS
       --filters (structure)
          An array of strings that specify which resources are included in the
          results of queries made using this view. When you use this view in a
          Search  operation,  the  filter string is combined with the search's
          QueryString parameter using a logical AND operator.

          For information about the supported syntax, see Search query  refer-
          ence  for  Resource Explorer in the Amazon Web Services Resource Ex-
          plorer User Guide .

          WARNING:
              This query string in the context of this operation supports only
              filter  prefixes  with  optional  operators . It doesn't support
              free-form text. For example, the string  region:us*  service:ec2
              -tag:stage=prod  includes all Amazon EC2 resources in any Amazon
              Web Services Region that begins with the letters us and  is  not
              tagged with a key Stage that has the value prod .

          FilterString -> (string)
              The  string that contains the search keywords, prefixes, and op-
              erators to control the results that can be returned by a  Search
              operation. For more details, see Search query syntax .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FilterString=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FilterString": "string"
          }

       --included-properties (list)
          Specifies  optional  fields that you want included in search results
          from this view. It is a list of objects that each describe  a  field
          to include.

          The  default  is  an empty list, with no optional fields included in
          the results.

          (structure)
              Information about an additional property that  describes  a  re-
              source,  that  you can optionally include in the view. This lets
              you view that property in search results, and filter your search
              results based on the value of the property.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the property that is included in this view.

                 You can specify the following property names for this field:

                 o Tags

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --view-arn (string)
          The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the view that you want to modify.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

              can be included in the results of queries made using this view.

              FilterString -> (string)
                 The  string  that contains the search keywords, prefixes, and
