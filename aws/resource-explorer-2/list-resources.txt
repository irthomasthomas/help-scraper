LIST-RESOURCES()                                              LIST-RESOURCES()



NAME
       list-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of resources and their details that match the specified
       criteria. This query must use a view. If you dont explicitly specify  a
       view,  then  Resource Explorer uses the default view for the Amazon Web
       Services Region in which you call this operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-resources uses document type values.  Document  types  follow  the
       JSON  data  model  where  valid values are: strings, numbers, booleans,
       null, arrays, and objects. For command input, options and nested param-
       eters that are labeled with the type document must be provided as JSON.
       Shorthand syntax does not support document types.

       list-resources is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Resources

OPTIONS
       --filters (structure)
          A  search  filter  defines  which  resources can be part of a search
          query result set.

          FilterString -> (string)
              The string that contains the search keywords, prefixes, and  op-
              erators to control the results that can be returned by a  Search
              operation. For more details, see Search query syntax .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FilterString=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FilterString": "string"
          }

       --view-arn (string)
          Specifies the Amazon resource name (ARN) of the view to use for  the
          query. If you don't specify a value for this parameter, then the op-
          eration automatically uses the default view for the Amazon Web  Ser-
          vices  Region  in which you called this operation. If the Region ei-
          ther doesn't have a default view or if you don't have permission  to
          use  the  default view, then the operation fails with a 401 Unautho-
          rized exception.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If present, indicates that more output is available than is included
          in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken request pa-
          rameter  in  a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part
          of the output. You should repeat this until the  NextToken  response
          element  comes  back as null . The pagination tokens expire after 24
          hours.

       Resources -> (list)
          The list of structures that describe the resources  that  match  the
          query.

          (structure)
              A  resource  in Amazon Web Services that Amazon Web Services Re-
              source Explorer has discovered, and for which it has stored  in-
              formation  in  the  index of the Amazon Web Services Region that
              contains the resource.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the resource.

              LastReportedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that Resource Explorer  last  queried  this
                 resource  and  updated  the index with the latest information
                 about the resource.

              OwningAccountId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account that owns the resource.

              Properties -> (list)
                 A structure with additional type-specific details  about  the
                 resource.  These  properties can be added by turning on inte-
                 gration between Resource Explorer and other Amazon  Web  Ser-
                 vices services.

                 (structure)

                     Data -> (document)
                        Details about this property. The content of this field
                        is a JSON object that varies  based  on  the  resource
                        type.

                     LastReportedAt -> (timestamp)
                        The  date and time that the information about this re-

                 The type of the resource.

              Service -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services service that owns the resource and is
                 responsible for creating and updating it.
