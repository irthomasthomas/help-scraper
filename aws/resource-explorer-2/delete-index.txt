DELETE-INDEX()                                                  DELETE-INDEX()



NAME
       delete-index -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the specified index and turns off Amazon Web Services Resource
       Explorer in the specified Amazon Web Services Region. When  you  delete
       an index, Resource Explorer stops discovering and indexing resources in
       that Region. Resource Explorer also deletes all views in  that  Region.
       These  actions occur as asynchronous background tasks. You can check to
       see when the actions are complete by using the  GetIndex operation  and
       checking the Status response value.

       NOTE:
          If  the  index you delete is the aggregator index for the Amazon Web
          Services account, you must wait 24 hours before you can promote  an-
          other  local index to be the aggregator index for the account. Users
          can't perform account-wide searches using  Resource  Explorer  until
          another aggregator index is configured.

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the index that you want to delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the index  that  you  successfully
          started the deletion process.

          NOTE:
              This  operation  is  asynchronous. To check its status, call the
              GetIndex operation.

       LastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The date and time when you last updated this index.

       State -> (string)
          Indicates the current state of the index.
