CREATE-INDEX()                                                  CREATE-INDEX()



NAME
       create-index -

DESCRIPTION
       Turns  on  Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer in the Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Region in which you called this operation by creating  an  index.
       Resource  Explorer  begins discovering the resources in this Region and
       stores the details about the resources in the index so that they can be
       queried  by  using the  Search operation. You can create only one index
       in a Region.

       NOTE:
          This operation creates only a local index. To promote the local  in-
          dex  in one Amazon Web Services Region into the aggregator index for
          the Amazon Web Services account, use the  UpdateIndexType operation.
          For more information, see Turning on cross-Region search by creating
          an aggregator index in the Amazon  Web  Services  Resource  Explorer
          User Guide .

       For  more details about what happens when you turn on Resource Explorer
       in an Amazon Web Services Region, see Turn on Resource Explorer to  in-
       dex  your  resources in an Amazon Web Services Region in the Amazon Web
       Services Resource Explorer User Guide .

       If this is the first Amazon Web Services Region in which you've created
       an index for Resource Explorer, then this operation also creates a ser-
       vice-linked role in your Amazon Web Services account  that  allows  Re-
       source Explorer to enumerate your resources to populate the index.

       o Action : resource-explorer-2:CreateIndex    Resource : The ARN of the
         index (as it will exist after the operation completes) in the  Amazon
         Web  Services Region and account in which you're trying to create the
         index. Use the wildcard character (* ) at the end of  the  string  to
         match  the eventual UUID. For example, the following Resource element
         restricts the role or user to creating an index in only the us-east-2
         Region  of  the specified account.  "Resource": "arn:aws:resource-ex-
         plorer-2:us-west-2:*<account-id>* :index/*"   Alternatively, you  can
         use  "Resource":  "*" to allow the role or user to create an index in
         any Region.

       o Action : iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole    Resource :  No  specific  re-
         source (*).  This permission is required only the first time you cre-
         ate an index to turn on Resource Explorer in  the  account.  Resource
         Explorer  uses this to create the service-linked role needed to index
         the resources in your account . Resource Explorer uses the same  ser-
         vice-linked role for all additional indexes you create afterwards.

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          This  value  helps  ensure  idempotency. Resource Explorer uses this
          value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate  versions.  We
          recommend  that you generate a UUID-type value to ensure the unique-
          ness of your index.

       --tags (map)
          The specified tags are attached only to the index  created  in  this
          Amazon  Web  Services Region. The tags aren't attached to any of the
          resources listed in the index.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To turn on Resource Explorer in an AWS Region by creating an index

       The following create-index example creates a local index in the AWS Re-
       gion in which the operation is called. The AWS CLI automatically gener-
       ates  a random client-token parameter value and includes it in the call
       to AWS if you don't specify a value.

          aws resource-explorer-2 create-index \
              --region us-east-1

       Output:

          {
              "Arn": "arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-east-1:123456789012:index/EXAMPLE8-90ab-cdef-fedc-EXAMPLE22222c",
              "CreatedAt": "2022-11-01T20:00:59.149Z",
              "State": "CREATING"
          }

       After you create a local index, you can convert it into the  aggregator
       index for the account by running the update-index-type command.

       For more information, see Turning on Resource Explorer in an AWS Region
       to index your resources in the AWS Resource Explorer Users Guide.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The ARN of the new local index for the  Region.  You  can  reference
          this ARN in IAM permission policies to authorize the following oper-
          ations:  DeleteIndex |  GetIndex |  UpdateIndexType |  CreateView

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The date and timestamp when the index was created.

       State -> (string)
          Indicates the current state of the index. You can check for  changes
          to  the  state  for asynchronous operations by calling the  GetIndex
          operation.

          NOTE:
              The state can remain in the CREATING or UPDATING state for  sev-
              eral  hours as Resource Explorer discovers the information about
              your resources and populates the index.
