CREATE-INDEX()                                                  CREATE-INDEX()



NAME
       create-index -

DESCRIPTION
       Turns  on  Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer in the Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Region in which you called this operation by creating  an  index.
       Resource  Explorer  begins discovering the resources in this Region and
       stores the details about the resources in the index so that they can be
       queried  by  using the  Search operation. You can create only one index
       in a Region.

       NOTE:
          This operation creates only a local index. To promote the local  in-
          dex  in one Amazon Web Services Region into the aggregator index for
          the Amazon Web Services account, use the  UpdateIndexType operation.
          For more information, see Turning on cross-Region search by creating
          an aggregator index in the Amazon  Web  Services  Resource  Explorer
          User Guide .

       For  more details about what happens when you turn on Resource Explorer
       in an Amazon Web Services Region, see Turn on Resource Explorer to  in-
       dex  your  resources in an Amazon Web Services Region in the Amazon Web
       Services Resource Explorer User Guide .

       If this is the first Amazon Web Services Region in which you've created
       an index for Resource Explorer, then this operation also creates a ser-
       vice-linked role in your Amazon Web Services account  that  allows  Re-
       source Explorer to enumerate your resources to populate the index.
          <ul>  <li>  <p>  <b>Action</b>:  <code>resource-explorer-2:CreateIn-
          dex</code> </p> <p> <b>Resource</b>: The ARN of  the  index  (as  it
          will exist after the operation completes) in the Amazon Web Services
          Region and account in which you're trying to create the  index.  Use
          the  wildcard character (<code>*</code>) at the end of the string to
          match the  eventual  UUID.  For  example,  the  following  <code>Re-
          source</code>  element restricts the role or user to creating an in-
          dex in only the <code>us-east-2</code> Region of the  specified  ac-
          count.</p>      <p>      <code>"Resource":     "arn:aws:resource-ex-
          plorer-2:us-east-2:<i>&lt;account-id&gt;</i>:index/*"</code>    </p>
          <p>Alternatively,  you can use <code>"Resource": "*"</code> to allow
          the role or user to create an index in any  Region.</p>  </li>  <li>
          <p> <b>Action</b>: <code>iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole</code> </p> <p>
          <b>Resource</b>: No specific resource (*). </p>  <p>This  permission
          is  required  only the first time you create an index to turn on Re-
          source Explorer in the account. Resource Explorer uses this to  cre-
          ate  the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/lat-
          est/userguide/security_iam_service-linked-roles.html">service-linked
          role needed to index the resources in your account</a>. Resource Ex-
          plorer uses the same service-linked role for all additional  indexes
          you create afterwards.</p> </li> </ul>

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          This  value  helps  ensure  idempotency. Resource Explorer uses this
          value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate  versions.  We
          recommend  that you generate a UUID-type value to ensure the unique-
          ness of your views.

       --tags (map)
          The specified tags are attached only to the index  created  in  this
          Amazon  Web  Services Region. The tags aren't attached to any of the
          resources listed in the index.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The  ARN  of  the  new local index for the Region. You can reference
          this ARN in IAM permission policies to authorize the following oper-
          ations:  DeleteIndex |  GetIndex |  UpdateIndexType |  CreateView

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The date and timestamp when the index was created.

       State -> (string)
          Indicates  the current state of the index. You can check for changes
          to the state for asynchronous operations by  calling  the   GetIndex
          operation.

          NOTE:
              The  state can remain in the CREATING or UPDATING state for sev-
              eral hours as Resource Explorer discovers the information  about
              your resources and populates the index.
