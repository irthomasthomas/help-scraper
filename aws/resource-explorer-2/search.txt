SEARCH()                                                              SEARCH()



NAME
       search -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches  for  resources  and displays details about all resources that
       match the specified criteria. You must specify a query string.

       All search queries must use a view. If you don't explicitly  specify  a
       view,  then Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer uses the default view
       for the Amazon Web Services Region in which you  call  this  operation.
       The results are the logical intersection of the results that match both
       the QueryString parameter supplied to this operation and the SearchFil-
       ter parameter attached to the view.

       For  the  complete  syntax  supported by the QueryString parameter, see
       Search query syntax reference for Resource Explorer .

       If your search results are empty, or are missing results that you think
       should be there, see Troubleshooting Resource Explorer search .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       search  uses  document type values. Document types follow the JSON data
       model where valid values are: strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays,
       and  objects. For command input, options and nested parameters that are
       labeled with the type document must be provided as JSON. Shorthand syn-
       tax does not support document types.

       search  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation  by  providing  the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output
       text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query  ar-
       gument  must  extract  data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Resources

OPTIONS
       --query-string (string)
          A string that includes keywords and filters  that  specify  the  re-
          sources that you want to include in the results.

          For  the complete syntax supported by the QueryString parameter, see
          Search query syntax reference for Resource Explorer .

          The search is completely case insensitive. You can specify an  empty
          string to return all results up to the limit of 1,000 total results.

          NOTE:
              The  operation  can  return only the first 1,000 results. If the
              resource you want is not included, then use  a  different  value
              for QueryString to refine the results.

       --view-arn (string)
          Specifies  the Amazon resource name (ARN) of the view to use for the
          query. If you don't specify a value for this parameter, then the op-
          eration  automatically uses the default view for the Amazon Web Ser-
          vices Region in which you called this operation. If the  Region  ei-
          ther  doesn't have a default view or if you don't have permission to
          use the default view, then the operation fails with a  401  Unautho-
          rized exception.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To search using the default view

       The  following  search  example displays all resources in the specified
       that are associated with the  service. The search uses the default view
       for  the Region. The example response includes a NextToken value, which
       indicates that there is more output available to  retrieve  with  addi-
       tional calls.

          aws resource-explorer-2 search \
              --query-string "service:iam"

       Example 2: To search using a specified view

       The following search example search displays all resources ("*") in the
       specified AWS Region that are visible through the specified  view.  The
       results  include  only  resources associated with Amazon EC2 because of
       the filters attached to the view.

OUTPUT
       Count -> (structure)
          The number of resources that match the query.

          Complete -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the TotalResources value represents an exhaus-
              tive count of search results.

              o If True , it indicates that the search was  exhaustive.  Every
                resource that matches the query was counted.

              o If False , then the search reached the limit of 1,000 matching
                results, and stopped counting.

          TotalResources -> (long)
              The number of resources that match the search query. This  value
              can't  exceed 1,000. If there are more than 1,000 resources that
              match the query, then only 1,000 are counted  and  the  Complete
              field  is  set to false. We recommend that you refine your query
              to return a smaller number of results.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If present, indicates that more output is available than is included
          in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken request pa-
          rameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the  next  part
          of  the  output. You should repeat this until the NextToken response
          element comes back as null . The pagination tokens expire  after  24
          hours.

       Resources -> (list)
          The  list  of  structures that describe the resources that match the
          query.

          (structure)
              A resource in Amazon Web Services that Amazon Web  Services  Re-
              source  Explorer has discovered, and for which it has stored in-
              formation in the index of the Amazon Web  Services  Region  that
              contains the resource.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the resource.

              LastReportedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time that Resource Explorer last queried this
                 resource and updated the index with  the  latest  information
                 about the resource.

              OwningAccountId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account that owns the resource.

              Properties -> (list)
                 A  structure  with additional type-specific details about the
                 resource. These properties can be added by turning  on  inte-
                 gration  between  Resource Explorer and other Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices services.

                 (structure)
                     A structure that describes a property of a resource.

                     Data -> (document)
                        Details about this property. The content of this field
                        is  a  JSON  object  that varies based on the resource
                        type.

                     LastReportedAt -> (timestamp)
                        The date and time that the information about this  re-
                        source property was last updated.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of this property of the resource.

              Region -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region in which the resource was cre-
                 ated and exists.

              ResourceType -> (string)
