DESCRIBE-CLUSTER()                                          DESCRIBE-CLUSTER()



NAME
       describe-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns descriptive information about an Amazon EKS cluster.

       The API server endpoint and certificate authority data returned by this
       operation are required for kubelet and kubectl to communicate with your
       Kubernetes  API  server.  For more information, see Create a kubeconfig
       for Amazon EKS .

       NOTE:
          The API server endpoint and certificate authority data aren't avail-
          able until the cluster reaches the ACTIVE state.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the cluster to describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

          The full description of your specified cluster.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the cluster.

          arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for  when  the  cluster  was
              created.

          version -> (string)
              The Kubernetes server version for the cluster.

          endpoint -> (string)
              The endpoint for your Kubernetes API server.

          roleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the IAM role that provides
              permissions for the Kubernetes control plane to  make  calls  to
              Amazon Web Services API operations on your behalf.

          resourcesVpcConfig -> (structure)
              The  VPC configuration used by the cluster control plane. Amazon
              EKS VPC resources have specific requirements  to  work  properly
              with Kubernetes. For more information, see Cluster VPC Consider-
              ations and Cluster Security Group Considerations in  the  Amazon
              EKS User Guide .

              subnetIds -> (list)
                 The subnets associated with your cluster.

                 (string)

              securityGroupIds -> (list)
                 The security groups associated with the cross-account elastic
                 network interfaces that are used to allow  communication  be-
                 tween your nodes and the Kubernetes control plane.

                 (string)

              clusterSecurityGroupId -> (string)
                 The cluster security group that was created by Amazon EKS for
                 the cluster. Managed node groups use this security group  for
                 control-plane-to-data-plane communication.

              vpcId -> (string)
                 The VPC associated with your cluster.

              endpointPublicAccess -> (boolean)
                 This  parameter  indicates  whether the Amazon EKS public API
                 server endpoint is enabled. If  the  Amazon  EKS  public  API
                 server  endpoint  is  disabled, your cluster's Kubernetes API
                 server can only receive requests that originate  from  within
                 the cluster VPC.

              endpointPrivateAccess -> (boolean)
                 This  parameter  indicates whether the Amazon EKS private API
                 server endpoint is enabled. If the  Amazon  EKS  private  API
                 server  endpoint  is  enabled,  Kubernetes  API requests that
                 originate from within your cluster's VPC use the private  VPC
                 endpoint instead of traversing the internet. If this value is
                 disabled and you have nodes or Fargate pods in  the  cluster,
                 then  ensure  that  publicAccessCidrs  includes the necessary
                 CIDR blocks for communication with the nodes or Fargate pods.
                 For  more information, see Amazon EKS cluster endpoint access
                 control in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

              publicAccessCidrs -> (list)
                 The CIDR blocks that are allowed  access  to  your  cluster's
                 public  Kubernetes  API server endpoint. Communication to the
                 endpoint from addresses outside of the listed CIDR blocks  is
                 denied.  The  default value is 0.0.0.0/0 . If you've disabled
                 private endpoint access and you have nodes or Fargate pods in
                 the  cluster,  then ensure that the necessary CIDR blocks are
                 listed. For more information, see Amazon EKS cluster endpoint
                 access control in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

                 (string)

          kubernetesNetworkConfig -> (structure)
              The Kubernetes network configuration for the cluster.

              serviceIpv4Cidr -> (string)
                 The  CIDR  block that Kubernetes pod and service IP addresses
                 are assigned from. Kubernetes assigns addresses from an  IPv4
                 CIDR  block  assigned to a subnet that the node is in. If you
                 didn't specify a CIDR block when  you  created  the  cluster,
                 then   Kubernetes   assigns   addresses   from   either   the
                 10.100.0.0/16 or 172.20.0.0/16 CIDR blocks. If this was spec-
                 ified, then it was specified when the cluster was created and
                 it can't be changed.

              serviceIpv6Cidr -> (string)
                 The CIDR block that Kubernetes pod and service  IP  addresses
                 are assigned from if you created a 1.21 or later cluster with
                 version 1.10.1 or later of the  Amazon  VPC  CNI  add-on  and
                 specified ipv6 for ipFamily when you created the cluster. Ku-
                 bernetes assigns service addresses from the unique local  ad-
                 dress  range  (fc00::/7  ) because you can't specify a custom
                 IPv6 CIDR block when you create the cluster.

              ipFamily -> (string)
                 The IP family used to assign Kubernetes pod  and  service  IP
                 addresses.  The  IP family is always ipv4 , unless you have a
                 1.21 or later cluster running version 1.10.1 or later of  the
                 Amazon VPC CNI add-on and specified ipv6 when you created the
                 cluster.

          logging -> (structure)
              The logging configuration for your cluster.

              clusterLogging -> (list)
                 The cluster control  plane  logging  configuration  for  your
                 cluster.

                 (structure)
                     An object representing the enabled or disabled Kubernetes
                     control plane logs for your cluster.

                     types -> (list)
                        The available cluster control plane log types.

                        (string)

                     enabled -> (boolean)
                        If a log type is enabled, that log  type  exports  its
                        control  plane  logs to CloudWatch Logs. If a log type
                        isn't enabled, that log type doesn't export  its  con-
                        trol  plane  logs. Each individual log type can be en-
                        abled or disabled independently.

          identity -> (structure)

              The certificate-authority-data for your cluster.

              data -> (string)
                 The  Base64-encoded  certificate data required to communicate
                 with your cluster. Add this to the certificate-authority-data
                 section of the kubeconfig file for your cluster.

          clientRequestToken -> (string)
              Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
              idempotency of the request.

          platformVersion -> (string)
              The platform version of your Amazon EKS cluster. For more infor-
              mation, see Platform Versions in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

          tags -> (map)
              The  metadata that you apply to the cluster to assist with cate-
              gorization and organization. Each tag consists of a key  and  an
              optional  value.  You define both. Cluster tags do not propagate
              to any other resources associated with the cluster.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

                 resources -> (list)
                     Specifies the resources to be encrypted.  The  only  sup-
                     ported value is "secrets".

                     (string)

                 provider -> (structure)
                     Key  Management  Service (KMS) key. Either the ARN or the
                     alias can be used.

                     keyArn -> (string)
                        Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or alias of  the  KMS  key.
                        The KMS key must be symmetric, created in the same re-
                        gion as the cluster, and if the KMS key was created in
                        a  different account, the user must have access to the
                        KMS key. For more information, see Allowing  Users  in
                        Other  Accounts to Use a KMS key in the Key Management
