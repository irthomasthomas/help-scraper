CREATE-ACCESS-ENTRY()                                    CREATE-ACCESS-ENTRY()



NAME
       create-access-entry -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an access entry.

       An  access entry allows an IAM principal to access your cluster. Access
       entries can replace the need to maintain entries in the aws-auth   Con-
       figMap for authentication. You have the following options for authoriz-
       ing an IAM principal to access Kubernetes objects on your cluster:  Ku-
       bernetes  role-based access control (RBAC), Amazon EKS, or both. Kuber-
       netes RBAC authorization requires you to create and  manage  Kubernetes
       Role  ,  ClusterRole , RoleBinding , and ClusterRoleBinding objects, in
       addition to managing access entries. If you use Amazon  EKS  authoriza-
       tion exclusively, you don't need to create and manage Kubernetes Role ,
       ClusterRole , RoleBinding , and ClusterRoleBinding objects.

       For more information about access entries, see Access  entries  in  the
       Amazon EKS User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of your cluster.

       --principal-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of the IAM principal for the AccessEntry . You can specify
          one ARN for each access entry. You can't specify  the  same  ARN  in
          more than one access entry. This value can't be changed after access
          entry creation.
              IAM best practices recommend using IAM roles with temporary cre-
              dentials, rather than IAM users with long-term credentials.

       --kubernetes-groups (list)
          The  value  for name that you've specified for kind: Group as a sub-
          ject in a Kubernetes RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding object.  Ama-
          zon  EKS doesn't confirm that the value for name exists in any bind-
          ings on your cluster. You can specify one or more names.

          Kubernetes authorizes the principalArn of the access entry to access
          any  cluster  objects  that you've specified in a Kubernetes Role or
          ClusterRole object that is also specified in a binding's  roleRef  .
          For  more  information about creating Kubernetes RoleBinding , Clus-
          terRoleBinding , Role , or ClusterRole objects, see Using  RBAC  Au-
          thorization in the Kubernetes documentation .

          If you want Amazon EKS to authorize the principalArn (instead of, or
          in addition to Kubernetes authorizing the principalArn  ),  you  can
          associate  one or more access policies to the access entry using As-
          sociateAccessPolicy . If you  associate  any  access  policies,  the
          principalARN  has  all permissions assigned in the associated access
          policies and all permissions in any Kubernetes Role  or  ClusterRole
          objects that the group names are bound to.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (map)
          Metadata that assists with categorization and organization. Each tag
          consists of a key and an optional value. You define both. Tags don't
          propagate to any other cluster or Amazon Web Services resources.

          key -> (string)
              One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a gen-
              eral label that acts like a category for more specific tag  val-
              ues.

          value -> (string)
              The  optional  part  of  a  key-value pair that make up a tag. A
              value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request.

       --username (string)
          The  username  to  authenticate to Kubernetes with. We recommend not
          specifying a username and letting Amazon EKS specify it for you. For
          more  information  about  the value Amazon EKS specifies for you, or
          constraints before specifying your own username, see Creating access
          entries in the Amazon EKS User Guide .

       --type (string)
          If  the principalArn is for an IAM role that's used for self-managed
          Amazon EC2 nodes, specify EC2_LINUX  or  EC2_WINDOWS  .  Amazon  EKS
          grants the necessary permissions to the node for you. If the princi-
          palArn is for any other purpose, specify STANDARD  .  If  you  don't
          specify a value, Amazon EKS sets the value to STANDARD . It's unnec-
          essary to create access entries for IAM roles used with Fargate pro-
          files  or  managed  Amazon EC2 nodes, because Amazon EKS creates en-
          tries in the aws-auth  ConfigMap for the  roles.  You  can't  change
          this value once you've created the access entry.

          If you set the value to EC2_LINUX or EC2_WINDOWS , you can't specify
          values for kubernetesGroups , or associate an  AccessPolicy  to  the
          access entry.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       accessEntry -> (structure)
          An access entry allows an IAM principal (user  or  role)  to  access
          your  cluster.  Access  entries can replace the need to maintain the
          aws-auth  ConfigMap for authentication. For more  information  about
          access entries, see Access entries in the Amazon EKS User Guide .

          clusterName -> (string)
              The name of your cluster.

          principalArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  of the IAM principal for the access entry. If you ever
              delete the IAM principal with this ARN, the access  entry  isn't
              automatically  deleted.  We recommend that you delete the access
              entry with an ARN for an IAM principal that you delete.  If  you
              don't  delete the access entry and ever recreate the IAM princi-
              pal, even if it has the same ARN, the access entry  won't  work.
              This  is  because even though the ARN is the same for the recre-
              ated IAM principal, the roleID or userID (you can see this  with
              the  Security  Token Service GetCallerIdentity API) is different
              for the recreated IAM principal than it was for the original IAM
              principal.  Even though you don't see the IAM principal's roleID
              or userID for an access entry, Amazon EKS stores it with the ac-
              cess entry.

          kubernetesGroups -> (list)
              A  name  that  you've  specified  in a Kubernetes RoleBinding or
              ClusterRoleBinding object  so  that  Kubernetes  authorizes  the
              principalARN access to cluster objects.

              (string)

          accessEntryArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the access entry.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The Unix epoch timestamp at object creation.

          modifiedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  Unix  epoch  timestamp for the last modification to the ob-
              ject.

          tags -> (map)
              Metadata that assists with categorization and organization. Each
              tag  consists  of  a key and an optional value. You define both.
              Tags don't propagate to any other cluster or Amazon Web Services
              resources.

              key -> (string)
                 One  part  of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              value -> (string)
                 The  optional  part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

          username -> (string)
              The name of a user that can authenticate to your cluster.

          type -> (string)
              The type of the access entry.
