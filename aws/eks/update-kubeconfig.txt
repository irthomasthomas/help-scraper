UPDATE-KUBECONFIG()                                        UPDATE-KUBECONFIG()



NAME
       update-kubeconfig -

DESCRIPTION
       Configures kubectl so that you can connect to an Amazon EKS cluster.

       Note:  To  use  the  resulting configuration, you must have kubectl in-
              stalled and in your PATH environment variable.

       This command constructs a configuration with  prepopulated  server  and
       certificate  authority  data  values  for a specified cluster.  You can
       specify an IAM role ARN with the --role-arn option to use for authenti-
       cation  when  you issue kubectl commands.  Otherwise, the IAM entity in
       your default AWS CLI or SDK credential chain is  used.   You  can  view
       your   default  AWS  CLI  or  SDK  identity  by  running  the  aws  sts
       get-caller-identity command.

       The resulting kubeconfig is created as a new file or merged with an ex-
       isting kubeconfig file using the following logic:

       o If  you specify a path with the --kubeconfig option, then the result-
         ing configuration file is created there or merged  with  an  existing
         kubeconfig at that location.

       o Or, if you have the KUBECONFIG environment variable set, then the re-
         sulting configuration file is created at  the  first  entry  in  that
         variable or merged with an existing kubeconfig at that location.

       o Otherwise, by default, the resulting configuration file is created at
         the default kubeconfig path (.kube/config) in your home directory  or
         merged with an existing kubeconfig at that location.

       o If  a previous cluster configuration exists for an Amazon EKS cluster
         with the same name at the specified path, the existing  configuration
         is overwritten with the new configuration.

       o When  update-kubeconfig  writes a configuration to a kubeconfig file,
         the current-context of the kubeconfig file is set to that  configura-
         tion.

       You  can  use the --dry-run option to print the resulting configuration
       to stdout instead of writing it to the specified location.

OPTIONS
       --name (string) The name of the cluster for which to create a  kubecon-
       fig entry. This cluster must exist in your account and in the specified
       or configured default Region for your AWS CLI installation.

       --kubeconfig (string) Optionally specify a kubeconfig  file  to  append
       with  your  configuration.  By default, the configuration is written to
       the first file path in the KUBECONFIG environment variable  (if  it  is
       set)  or the default kubeconfig path (.kube/config) in your home direc-
       tory.

       --role-arn (string) To assume a role for cluster authentication,  spec-
       ify  an  IAM  role  ARN with this option. For example, if you created a
       cluster while assuming an IAM role, then you must also assume that role
       to connect to the cluster the first time.

       --dry-run  (boolean)  Print  the merged kubeconfig to stdout instead of
       writing it to the specified file.

       --verbose (boolean) Print more detailed  output  when  writing  to  the
       kubeconfig file, including the appended entries.

       --alias  (string) Alias for the cluster context name. Defaults to match
       cluster ARN.

       --user-alias (string) Alias for the generated user  name.  Defaults  to
       match cluster ARN.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
