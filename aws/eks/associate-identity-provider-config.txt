NAME
       associate-identity-provider-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates an identity provider configuration to a cluster.

       If  you want to authenticate identities using an identity provider, you
       can create an identity provider configuration and associate it to  your
       cluster.  After configuring authentication to your cluster you can cre-
       ate Kubernetes Role and  ClusterRole  objects,  assign  permissions  to
       them, and then bind them to the identities using Kubernetes RoleBinding
       and ClusterRoleBinding objects. For more information see Using RBAC Au-
       thorization in the Kubernetes documentation.

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of your cluster.

       --oidc (structure)
          An  object  representing  an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider
          configuration.

          identityProviderConfigName -> (string)
              The name of the OIDC provider configuration.

          issuerUrl -> (string)
              The URL of the OIDC identity provider that allows the API server
              to  discover  public  signing keys for verifying tokens. The URL
              must begin with https:// and should correspond to the iss  claim
              in  the  provider's  OIDC ID tokens. Based on the OIDC standard,
              path components are allowed but query parameters are not.  Typi-
              cally    the   URL   consists   of   only   a   hostname,   like
              https://server.example.org or  https://example.com  .  This  URL
              should point to the level below .well-known/openid-configuration
              and must be publicly accessible over the internet.

          clientId -> (string)
              This is also known as audience . The ID for the client  applica-
              tion  that  makes  authentication  requests to the OIDC identity
              provider.

          usernameClaim -> (string)
              The JSON Web Token (JWT) claim to use as the username.  The  de-
              fault  is  sub  , which is expected to be a unique identifier of
              the end user. You can choose other claims, such as email or name
              ,  depending  on  the  OIDC identity provider. Claims other than
              email are prefixed with the issuer URL to prevent naming clashes
              with other plug-ins.

          usernamePrefix -> (string)
              The  prefix  that  is  prepended  to  username claims to prevent
              clashes with existing names. If you do not provide  this  field,
              and  username  is a value other than email , the prefix defaults
              to issuerurl# . You can use the value - to disable  all  prefix-
              ing.

          groupsClaim -> (string)
              The JWT claim that the provider uses to return your groups.

          groupsPrefix -> (string)
              The  prefix that is prepended to group claims to prevent clashes
              with existing names (such as system: groups). For  example,  the
              value``oidc:`` will create group names like oidc:engineering and
              oidc:infra .

          requiredClaims -> (map)
              The key value pairs that describe required claims in  the  iden-
              tity  token. If set, each claim is verified to be present in the
              token with a matching value. For the maximum  number  of  claims
              that  you can require, see Amazon EKS service quotas in the Ama-
              zon EKS User Guide .

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          identityProviderConfigName=string,issuerUrl=string,clientId=string,usernameClaim=string,usernamePrefix=string,groupsClaim=string,groupsPrefix=string,requiredClaims={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "identityProviderConfigName": "string",
            "issuerUrl": "string",
            "clientId": "string",
            "usernameClaim": "string",
            "usernamePrefix": "string",
            "groupsClaim": "string",
            "groupsPrefix": "string",
            "requiredClaims": {"string": "string"
              ...}
          }

       --tags (map)
          Metadata that assists with categorization and organization. Each tag
          consists of a key and an optional value. You define both. Tags don't
          propagate to any other cluster or Amazon Web Services resources.

          key -> (string)
              One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a gen-
              eral  label that acts like a category for more specific tag val-
              ues.

          value -> (string)
              The optional part of a key-value pair that  make  up  a  tag.  A
              value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --client-request-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
