NAME
       create-addon -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an Amazon EKS add-on.

       Amazon EKS add-ons help to automate the provisioning and lifecycle man-
       agement of common operational software for  Amazon  EKS  clusters.  For
       more information, see Amazon EKS add-ons in the Amazon EKS User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the cluster to create the add-on for.

       --addon-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  add-on. The name must match one of the names re-
          turned            by             `             DescribeAddonVersions
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAddonVersions.html`__
          .

       --addon-version (string)
          The version of the add-on. The version must match one  of  the  ver-
          sions        returned        by        `       DescribeAddonVersions
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAddonVersions.html`__
          .

       --service-account-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of an existing IAM role to bind to
          the add-on's service account. The role must be assigned the IAM per-
          missions  required  by  the add-on. If you don't specify an existing
          IAM role, then the add-on uses the permissions assigned to the  node
          IAM  role. For more information, see Amazon EKS node IAM role in the
          Amazon EKS User Guide .

          NOTE:
              To specify an existing IAM role, you must  have  an  IAM  OpenID
              Connect  (OIDC)  provider created for your cluster. For more in-
              formation, see Enabling IAM roles for service accounts  on  your
              cluster in the Amazon EKS User Guide .

       --resolve-conflicts (string)
          How  to resolve field value conflicts for an Amazon EKS add-on. Con-
          flicts are handled based on the value you choose:

          o None  If the self-managed version of the add-on  is  installed  on
            your cluster, Amazon EKS doesn't change the value. Creation of the
            add-on might fail.

          o Overwrite  If the self-managed version of the add-on is  installed
            on your cluster and the Amazon EKS default value is different than
            the existing value, Amazon EKS changes the value to the Amazon EKS
            default value.

          o Preserve   Not  supported. You can set this value when updating an
            add-on though. For more information, see UpdateAddon .

          If you don't currently have the self-managed version of  the  add-on
          installed  on your cluster, the Amazon EKS add-on is installed. Ama-
          zon EKS sets all values to default values, regardless of the  option
          that you specify.

          Possible values:

          o OVERWRITE

          o NONE

          o PRESERVE

       --client-request-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request.

       --tags (map)
          The metadata to apply to the cluster to assist  with  categorization
          and  organization. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value.
          You define both.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --configuration-values (string)
          The set of configuration values for the add-on being created.  What-
          ever  values  provided  here are validated against the schema from `
          DescribeAddonConfiguration
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAddonConfiguration.html`__
          .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
