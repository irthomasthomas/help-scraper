CREATE-CLUSTER()                                              CREATE-CLUSTER()



NAME
       create-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an Amazon EKS control plane.

       The  Amazon  EKS control plane consists of control plane instances that
       run the Kubernetes software, such as etcd and the API server. The  con-
       trol  plane  runs in an account managed by Amazon Web Services, and the
       Kubernetes API is exposed by the Amazon EKS API server  endpoint.  Each
       Amazon  EKS  cluster control plane is single tenant and unique. It runs
       on its own set of Amazon EC2 instances.

       The cluster control plane is provisioned across  multiple  Availability
       Zones  and  fronted by an Elastic Load Balancing Network Load Balancer.
       Amazon EKS also provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC  sub-
       nets  to  provide  connectivity from the control plane instances to the
       nodes (for example, to support kubectl exec , logs  ,  and  proxy  data
       flows).

       Amazon EKS nodes run in your Amazon Web Services account and connect to
       your cluster's control plane over the Kubernetes  API  server  endpoint
       and a certificate file that is created for your cluster.

       You  can use the endpointPublicAccess and endpointPrivateAccess parame-
       ters to enable or disable public and private access to  your  cluster's
       Kubernetes  API  server endpoint. By default, public access is enabled,
       and private access is disabled. For more information,  see  Amazon  EKS
       Cluster Endpoint Access Control in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

       You  can  use  the logging parameter to enable or disable exporting the
       Kubernetes control plane logs for your cluster to CloudWatch  Logs.  By
       default, cluster control plane logs aren't exported to CloudWatch Logs.
       For more information, see Amazon EKS Cluster Control Plane Logs in  the
       * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

       NOTE:
          CloudWatch  Logs ingestion, archive storage, and data scanning rates
          apply to exported control plane  logs.  For  more  information,  see
          CloudWatch Pricing .

       In  most cases, it takes several minutes to create a cluster. After you
       create an Amazon EKS cluster, you must configure your Kubernetes  tool-
       ing to communicate with the API server and launch nodes into your clus-
       ter. For more information, see Allowing users to  access  your  cluster
       and Launching Amazon EKS nodes in the Amazon EKS User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The unique name to give to your cluster.

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that provides permis-
          sions for the Kubernetes control plane to make calls to  Amazon  Web
          Services  API  operations  on your behalf. For more information, see
          Amazon EKS Service IAM Role in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

       --resources-vpc-config (structure)
          The VPC configuration that's used by the cluster control plane. Ama-
          zon  EKS  VPC  resources have specific requirements to work properly
          with Kubernetes. For more information, see  Cluster  VPC  Considera-
          tions  and  Cluster  Security Group Considerations in the Amazon EKS
          User Guide . You must specify at least two subnets. You can  specify
          up  to  five  security  groups. However, we recommend that you use a
          dedicated security group for your cluster control plane.

          subnetIds -> (list)
              Specify subnets for your Amazon EKS nodes.  Amazon  EKS  creates
              cross-account elastic network interfaces in these subnets to al-
              low communication between your nodes and the Kubernetes  control
              plane.

              (string)

          securityGroupIds -> (list)
              Specify  one or more security groups for the cross-account elas-
              tic network interfaces that Amazon EKS creates to use that allow
              communication  between  your  nodes  and  the Kubernetes control
              plane. If you don't specify any security groups, then  familiar-
              ize yourself with the difference between Amazon EKS defaults for
              clusters deployed with Kubernetes.  For  more  information,  see
              Amazon  EKS  security  group  considerations in the * Amazon EKS
              User Guide * .

              (string)

          endpointPublicAccess -> (boolean)
              Set this value to false to disable public access to  your  clus-
              ter's  Kubernetes API server endpoint. If you disable public ac-
              cess, your cluster's Kubernetes API server can only receive  re-
              quests  from  within the cluster VPC. The default value for this
              parameter is true , which enables public access for your  Kuber-
              netes  API  server. For more information, see Amazon EKS cluster
              endpoint access control in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

          endpointPrivateAccess -> (boolean)
              Set this value to true to enable private access for  your  clus-
              ter's  Kubernetes API server endpoint. If you enable private ac-
              cess, Kubernetes API requests from within your cluster's VPC use
              the  private  VPC endpoint. The default value for this parameter
              is false , which disables private access for your Kubernetes API
              server. If you disable private access and you have nodes or Far-
              gate pods in the cluster, then ensure that publicAccessCidrs in-
              cludes  the  necessary  CIDR  blocks  for communication with the
              nodes or Fargate pods. For  more  information,  see  Amazon  EKS
              cluster endpoint access control in the * Amazon EKS User Guide *
              .

          publicAccessCidrs -> (list)
              The CIDR blocks that are allowed access to your cluster's public
              Kubernetes  API  server  endpoint. Communication to the endpoint
              from addresses outside of the CIDR blocks that  you  specify  is
              denied. The default value is 0.0.0.0/0 . If you've disabled pri-
              vate endpoint access, make sure that you specify  the  necessary
              CIDR  blocks  for every node and Fargate Pod in the cluster. For
              more information, see Amazon EKS cluster endpoint access control
              in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          subnetIds=string,string,securityGroupIds=string,string,endpointPublicAccess=boolean,endpointPrivateAccess=boolean,publicAccessCidrs=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "subnetIds": ["string", ...],
            "securityGroupIds": ["string", ...],
            "endpointPublicAccess": true|false,
            "endpointPrivateAccess": true|false,
            "publicAccessCidrs": ["string", ...]
          }

       --kubernetes-network-config (structure)
          The Kubernetes network configuration for the cluster.

          serviceIpv4Cidr -> (string)
              Don't specify a value if you select ipv6 for ipFamily . The CIDR
              block to assign Kubernetes service IP  addresses  from.  If  you
              don't  specify a block, Kubernetes assigns addresses from either
              the 10.100.0.0/16 or 172.20.0.0/16  CIDR  blocks.  We  recommend
              that you specify a block that does not overlap with resources in
              other networks that are peered or connected  to  your  VPC.  The
              block must meet the following requirements:

              o Within  one  of  the  following  private  IP  address  blocks:
                10.0.0.0/8 , 172.16.0.0/12 , or 192.168.0.0/16 .

              o Doesn't overlap with any CIDR block assigned to the  VPC  that
                you selected for VPC.

              o Between /24 and /12 .

              WARNING:
                 You  can  only  specify a custom CIDR block when you create a
                 cluster. You can't change this value  after  the  cluster  is
                 created.

          ipFamily -> (string)
              Specify  which  IP  family  is used to assign Kubernetes pod and
              service IP addresses. If you don't specify a value, ipv4 is used
              by  default. You can only specify an IP family when you create a
              cluster and can't change this value once the cluster is created.
              If  you  specify ipv6 , the VPC and subnets that you specify for
              cluster creation must have both IPv4 and IPv6  CIDR  blocks  as-
              signed to them. You can't specify ipv6 for clusters in China Re-
              gions.

              You can only specify ipv6 for 1.21 and later clusters  that  use
              version  1.10.1  or  later  of the Amazon VPC CNI add-on. If you
              specify ipv6 , then ensure that your VPC meets the  requirements
              listed  in the considerations listed in Assigning IPv6 addresses
              to pods and services in the Amazon EKS  User  Guide.  Kubernetes
              assigns  services  IPv6  addresses from the unique local address
              range (fc00::/7) . You can't specify a custom IPv6  CIDR  block.
              Pod addresses are assigned from the subnet's IPv6 CIDR.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          serviceIpv4Cidr=string,ipFamily=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "serviceIpv4Cidr": "string",
            "ipFamily": "ipv4"|"ipv6"
          }

       --logging (structure)
          Enable  or  disable  exporting the Kubernetes control plane logs for
          your cluster to CloudWatch Logs. By default, cluster  control  plane
          logs  aren't  exported to CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see
          Amazon EKS Cluster control plane logs in the * Amazon EKS User Guide
          * .

          NOTE:
              CloudWatch  Logs  ingestion,  archive storage, and data scanning
              rates apply to exported control plane logs.  For  more  informa-
              tion, see CloudWatch Pricing .

          clusterLogging -> (list)
              The  cluster  control plane logging configuration for your clus-
              ter.

              (structure)
                 An object representing the  enabled  or  disabled  Kubernetes
                 control plane logs for your cluster.

                 types -> (list)
                     The available cluster control plane log types.

                     (string)

                 enabled -> (boolean)
                     If  a log type is enabled, that log type exports its con-
                     trol plane logs to CloudWatch Logs. If a log  type  isn't
                     enabled,  that  log type doesn't export its control plane
                     logs. Each individual log type can be enabled or disabled
                     independently.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "clusterLogging": [

          idempotency of the request.

       --tags (map)
          Metadata that assists with categorization and organization. Each tag
          consists of a key and an optional value. You define both. Tags don't
          propagate to any other cluster or Amazon Web Services resources.

          key -> (string)
              One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a gen-
              eral  label that acts like a category for more specific tag val-
              ues.

          value -> (string)
              The optional part of a key-value pair that  make  up  a  tag.  A
              value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

              provider -> (structure)
                 Key Management Service (KMS) key. Either the ARN or the alias
                 can be used.

                 keyArn -> (string)
                     Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) or alias of the KMS key. The
                     KMS key must be symmetric and created in the same  Amazon
                     Web  Services  Region  as the cluster. If the KMS key was
                     created in a different account, the  IAM  principal  must
                     have  access  to  the  KMS key. For more information, see
                     Allowing users in other accounts to use a KMS key in  the

          ]

       --outpost-config (structure)
          An  object  representing  the configuration of your local Amazon EKS
          cluster on an Amazon Web Services Outpost. Before creating  a  local
          cluster  on an Outpost, review Local clusters for Amazon EKS on Ama-
          zon Web Services Outposts in the Amazon EKS User Guide . This object
          isn't  available  for creating Amazon EKS clusters on the Amazon Web
          Services cloud.

          outpostArns -> (list)
              The ARN of the Outpost that you want to use for your local  Ama-
              zon  EKS  cluster on Outposts. Only a single Outpost ARN is sup-
              ported.

              (string)

          controlPlaneInstanceType -> (string)
              The Amazon EC2 instance type that you want to use for your local
              Amazon EKS cluster on Outposts. Choose an instance type based on
              the number of nodes that your cluster will have. For more infor-
              mation, see Capacity considerations in the Amazon EKS User Guide
              .

              The instance type that you specify is used  for  all  Kubernetes
              control  plane instances. The instance type can't be changed af-
              ter cluster creation. The control  plane  is  not  automatically
              scaled by Amazon EKS.

          }

       --access-config (structure)
          The access configuration for the cluster.

          bootstrapClusterCreatorAdminPermissions -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether or not the cluster creator IAM  principal  was
              set  as  a  cluster  admin  access entry during cluster creation
              time. The default value is true .

          authenticationMode -> (string)
              The desired authentication mode for the cluster. If you create a
              cluster  by  using  the  EKS  API,  Amazon Web Services SDKs, or
              CloudFormation, the default is CONFIG_MAP . If  you  create  the

          }

       --bootstrap-self-managed-addons  |   --no-bootstrap-self-managed-addons
       (boolean)
          If  you set this value to False when creating a cluster, the default
          networking add-ons will not be installed.

          The  default  networking  addons  include  vpc-cni,   coredns,   and
          kube-proxy.

          Use  this  option  when  you plan to install third-party alternative
          add-ons or self-manage the default networking add-ons.

       --upgrade-policy (structure)
          New clusters, by default, have extended  support  enabled.  You  can
          disable  extended  support  when  creating a cluster by setting this
          value to STANDARD .

          supportType -> (string)
              If the cluster is set to EXTENDED , it will enter extended  sup-
              port  at  the  end of standard support. If the cluster is set to
              STANDARD , it will be automatically upgraded at the end of stan-
              dard support.

          }

       --kubernetes-version (string)
          The  desired Kubernetes version for your cluster. If you don't spec-
          ify a value here, the default version available  in  Amazon  EKS  is
          used.

          NOTE:
              The default version might not be the latest version available.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

          arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The Unix epoch timestamp at object creation.

          version -> (string)
              The Kubernetes server version for the cluster.

          roleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the IAM role that provides
              permissions for the Kubernetes control plane to  make  calls  to
              Amazon Web Services API operations on your behalf.

          resourcesVpcConfig -> (structure)
              The  VPC configuration used by the cluster control plane. Amazon
              EKS VPC resources have specific requirements  to  work  properly
              with Kubernetes. For more information, see Cluster VPC consider-
              ations and Cluster security group considerations in  the  Amazon
              EKS User Guide .

              subnetIds -> (list)
                 The subnets associated with your cluster.

                 (string)

              securityGroupIds -> (list)
                 The security groups associated with the cross-account elastic
                 network interfaces that are used to allow  communication  be-
                 tween your nodes and the Kubernetes control plane.

                 (string)

              clusterSecurityGroupId -> (string)
                 The cluster security group that was created by Amazon EKS for
                 the cluster. Managed node groups use this security group  for
                 control-plane-to-data-plane communication.

              vpcId -> (string)
                 The VPC associated with your cluster.

              endpointPublicAccess -> (boolean)
                 Whether the public API server endpoint is enabled.

              endpointPrivateAccess -> (boolean)
                 This  parameter  indicates whether the Amazon EKS private API
                 server endpoint is enabled. If the  Amazon  EKS  private  API
                 server  endpoint  is  enabled,  Kubernetes  API requests that
                 originate from within your cluster's VPC use the private  VPC
                 endpoint instead of traversing the internet. If this value is
                 disabled and you have nodes or Fargate pods in  the  cluster,
                 then  ensure  that  publicAccessCidrs  includes the necessary
                 CIDR blocks for communication with the nodes or Fargate pods.
                 For  more information, see Amazon EKS cluster endpoint access
                 control in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

              publicAccessCidrs -> (list)
                 The CIDR blocks that are allowed  access  to  your  cluster's
                 public Kubernetes API server endpoint.

                 (string)

          kubernetesNetworkConfig -> (structure)
              The Kubernetes network configuration for the cluster.

              serviceIpv4Cidr -> (string)
                 The  CIDR block that Kubernetes Pod and Service object IP ad-
                 dresses are assigned from. Kubernetes assigns addresses  from
                 an  IPv4 CIDR block assigned to a subnet that the node is in.
                 If you didn't specify a CIDR block when you created the clus-
                 ter,  then  Kubernetes  assigns  addresses  from  either  the
                 10.100.0.0/16 or 172.20.0.0/16 CIDR blocks. If this was spec-
                 ified, then it was specified when the cluster was created and
                 it can't be changed.

              serviceIpv6Cidr -> (string)
                 The CIDR block that Kubernetes pod and service  IP  addresses
                 are assigned from if you created a 1.21 or later cluster with
                 version 1.10.1 or later of the  Amazon  VPC  CNI  add-on  and
                 specified ipv6 for ipFamily when you created the cluster. Ku-
                 bernetes assigns service addresses from the unique local  ad-
                 dress  range  (fc00::/7  ) because you can't specify a custom
                 IPv6 CIDR block when you create the cluster.

              ipFamily -> (string)
                 The IP family used to assign Kubernetes Pod and  Service  ob-
                 jects IP addresses. The IP family is always ipv4 , unless you
                 have a 1.21 or later cluster running version 1.10.1 or  later
                 of  the  Amazon  VPC  CNI plugin for Kubernetes and specified
                 ipv6 when you created the cluster.

          logging -> (structure)
              The logging configuration for your cluster.

              clusterLogging -> (list)
                 The cluster control  plane  logging  configuration  for  your
                 cluster.

                 (structure)

                        The available cluster control plane log types.

                        (string)

                     enabled -> (boolean)
                        If a log type is enabled, that log  type  exports  its
                        control  plane  logs to CloudWatch Logs. If a log type
                        isn't enabled, that log type doesn't export  its  con-
                        trol  plane  logs. Each individual log type can be en-
                        abled or disabled independently.

                 The  Base64-encoded  certificate data required to communicate
                 with your cluster. Add this to the certificate-authority-data
                 section of the kubeconfig file for your cluster.

          clientRequestToken -> (string)
              A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure
              the idempotency of the request.

          platformVersion -> (string)
              The platform version of your Amazon EKS cluster. For more infor-
              mation about clusters deployed on the Amazon Web Services Cloud,
              see Platform versions in the * Amazon EKS User  Guide  *  .  For

              tag consists of a key and an optional value.  You  define  both.
              Tags don't propagate to any other cluster or Amazon Web Services
              resources.

              key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key  is  a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a  tag.  A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

              The encryption configuration for the cluster.

              (structure)
                 The encryption configuration for the cluster.

                 resources -> (list)
                     Specifies  the  resources  to be encrypted. The only sup-
                     ported value is secrets .

                 provider -> (structure)
                     Key Management Service (KMS) key. Either the ARN  or  the
                     alias can be used.

                     keyArn -> (string)
                        Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) or alias of the KMS key.
                        The KMS key must be symmetric and created in the  same
                        Amazon  Web Services Region as the cluster. If the KMS
                        key was created in a different account, the IAM  prin-
                        cipal must have access to the KMS key. For more infor-
                        mation, see Allowing users in other accounts to use  a
                        KMS  key in the Key Management Service Developer Guide
