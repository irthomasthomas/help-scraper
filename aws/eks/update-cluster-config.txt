UPDATE-CLUSTER-CONFIG()                                UPDATE-CLUSTER-CONFIG()



NAME
       update-cluster-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  an Amazon EKS cluster configuration. Your cluster continues to
       function during the update. The response output includes an  update  ID
       that  you  can  use to track the status of your cluster update with the
       DescribeUpdate API operation.

       You can use this API operation to enable or disable exporting  the  Ku-
       bernetes control plane logs for your cluster to CloudWatch Logs. By de-
       fault, cluster control plane logs aren't exported to  CloudWatch  Logs.
       For  more information, see Amazon EKS Cluster Control Plane Logs in the
       * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

       NOTE:
          CloudWatch Logs ingestion, archive storage, and data scanning  rates
          apply  to  exported  control  plane  logs. For more information, see
          CloudWatch Pricing .

       You can also use this API operation to enable  or  disable  public  and
       private access to your cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint. By de-
       fault, public access is enabled, and private access  is  disabled.  For
       more information, see Amazon EKS cluster endpoint access control in the
       * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

       WARNING:
          You can't update the subnets or security group IDs for  an  existing
          cluster.

       Cluster  updates  are asynchronous, and they should finish within a few
       minutes. During an update, the cluster status moves to  UPDATING  (this
       status  transition  is  eventually consistent). When the update is com-
       plete (either Failed or Successful ), the cluster status moves  to  Ac-
       tive .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the Amazon EKS cluster to update.

       --resources-vpc-config (structure)
          An  object  representing  the VPC configuration to use for an Amazon
          EKS cluster.

          subnetIds -> (list)
              Specify subnets for your Amazon EKS nodes.  Amazon  EKS  creates
              cross-account elastic network interfaces in these subnets to al-
              low communication between your nodes and the Kubernetes  control
              plane.

              (string)

          securityGroupIds -> (list)
              Specify  one or more security groups for the cross-account elas-
              tic network interfaces that Amazon EKS creates to use that allow
              communication  between  your  nodes  and  the Kubernetes control
              plane. If you don't specify any security groups, then  familiar-
              ize yourself with the difference between Amazon EKS defaults for
              clusters deployed with Kubernetes.  For  more  information,  see
              Amazon  EKS  security  group  considerations in the * Amazon EKS
              User Guide * .

              (string)

          endpointPublicAccess -> (boolean)
              Set this value to false to disable public access to  your  clus-
              ter's  Kubernetes API server endpoint. If you disable public ac-
              cess, your cluster's Kubernetes API server can only receive  re-
              quests  from  within the cluster VPC. The default value for this
              parameter is true , which enables public access for your  Kuber-
              netes  API  server. For more information, see Amazon EKS cluster
              endpoint access control in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

          endpointPrivateAccess -> (boolean)
              Set this value to true to enable private access for  your  clus-
              ter's  Kubernetes API server endpoint. If you enable private ac-
              cess, Kubernetes API requests from within your cluster's VPC use
              the  private  VPC endpoint. The default value for this parameter
              is false , which disables private access for your Kubernetes API
              server. If you disable private access and you have nodes or Far-
              gate pods in the cluster, then ensure that publicAccessCidrs in-
              cludes  the  necessary  CIDR  blocks  for communication with the
              nodes or Fargate pods. For  more  information,  see  Amazon  EKS
              cluster endpoint access control in the * Amazon EKS User Guide *
              .

          publicAccessCidrs -> (list)
              The CIDR blocks that are allowed access to your cluster's public
              Kubernetes  API  server  endpoint. Communication to the endpoint
              from addresses outside of the CIDR blocks that  you  specify  is
              denied. The default value is 0.0.0.0/0 . If you've disabled pri-
              vate endpoint access and you have nodes or Fargate pods  in  the
              cluster, then ensure that you specify the necessary CIDR blocks.
              For more information, see Amazon  EKS  cluster  endpoint  access
              control in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          subnetIds=string,string,securityGroupIds=string,string,endpointPublicAccess=boolean,endpointPrivateAccess=boolean,publicAccessCidrs=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "subnetIds": ["string", ...],
            "securityGroupIds": ["string", ...],
            "endpointPublicAccess": true|false,
            "endpointPrivateAccess": true|false,
            "publicAccessCidrs": ["string", ...]
          }

       --logging (structure)
          Enable  or  disable  exporting the Kubernetes control plane logs for
          your cluster to CloudWatch Logs. By default, cluster  control  plane
          logs  aren't  exported to CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see
          Amazon EKS cluster control plane logs in the * Amazon EKS User Guide
          * .

          NOTE:
              CloudWatch  Logs  ingestion,  archive storage, and data scanning
              rates apply to exported control plane logs.  For  more  informa-
              tion, see CloudWatch Pricing .

          clusterLogging -> (list)
              The  cluster  control plane logging configuration for your clus-
              ter.

              (structure)
                 An object representing the  enabled  or  disabled  Kubernetes
                 control plane logs for your cluster.

                 types -> (list)
                     The available cluster control plane log types.

                     (string)

                 enabled -> (boolean)
                     If  a log type is enabled, that log type exports its con-
                     trol plane logs to CloudWatch Logs. If a log  type  isn't
                     enabled,  that  log type doesn't export its control plane
                     logs. Each individual log type can be enabled or disabled
                     independently.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "clusterLogging": [
              {
                "types": ["api"|"audit"|"authenticator"|"controllerManager"|"scheduler", ...],
                "enabled": true|false
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
