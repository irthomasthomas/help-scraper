OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of your cluster.

       --principal-arn (string)
          The ARN of the IAM principal for the AccessEntry .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       accessEntry -> (structure)
          Information about the access entry.

          clusterName -> (string)
              The name of your cluster.

          principalArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the IAM principal for the access entry. If  you  ever
              delete  the  IAM principal with this ARN, the access entry isn't
              automatically deleted. We recommend that you delete  the  access
              entry  with  an ARN for an IAM principal that you delete. If you
              don't delete the access entry and ever recreate the IAM  princi-
              pal,  even  if it has the same ARN, the access entry won't work.
              This is because even though the ARN is the same for  the  recre-
              ated  IAM principal, the roleID or userID (you can see this with
              the Security Token Service GetCallerIdentity API)  is  different
              for the recreated IAM principal than it was for the original IAM
              principal. Even though you don't see the IAM principal's  roleID
              or userID for an access entry, Amazon EKS stores it with the ac-
              cess entry.

          kubernetesGroups -> (list)
              A name that you've specified  in  a  Kubernetes  RoleBinding  or
              ClusterRoleBinding  object  so  that  Kubernetes  authorizes the
              principalARN access to cluster objects.

              (string)

          accessEntryArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the access entry.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The Unix epoch timestamp at object creation.

          modifiedAt -> (timestamp)
              The Unix epoch timestamp for the last modification  to  the  ob-
              ject.

          tags -> (map)
              Metadata that assists with categorization and organization. Each
              tag consists of a key and an optional value.  You  define  both.
              Tags don't propagate to any other cluster or Amazon Web Services
              resources.

              key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key  is  a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a  tag.  A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

          username -> (string)
              The name of a user that can authenticate to your cluster.

          type -> (string)
              The type of the access entry.
