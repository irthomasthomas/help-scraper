OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number of cluster results returned by ListEksAnywhere-
          Subscriptions in paginated output. When you use this parameter, Lis-
          tEksAnywhereSubscriptions  returns only maxResults results in a sin-
          gle page along with a nextToken response element. You  can  see  the
          remaining  results of the initial request by sending another ListEk-
          sAnywhereSubscriptions request with the  returned  nextToken  value.
          This  value  can be between 1 and 100. If you don't use this parame-
          ter, ListEksAnywhereSubscriptions returns up to  10  results  and  a
          nextToken value if applicable.

       --next-token (string)
          The  nextToken value to include in a future ListEksAnywhereSubscrip-
          tions request. When the results  of  a  ListEksAnywhereSubscriptions
          request  exceed  maxResults,  you can use this value to retrieve the
          next page of results. This value is null when there are no more  re-
          sults to return.

       --include-status (list)
          An array of subscription statuses to filter on.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CREATING
            ACTIVE
            UPDATING
            EXPIRING
            EXPIRED
            DELETING

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
