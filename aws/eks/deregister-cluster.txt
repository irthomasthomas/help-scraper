NAME
       deregister-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Deregisters  a  connected cluster to remove it from the Amazon EKS con-
       trol plane.

       A connected cluster is a Kubernetes cluster that  you've  connected  to
       your control plane using the Amazon EKS Connector .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the connected cluster to deregister.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              permissions for the Kubernetes control plane to  make  calls  to
              Amazon Web Services API operations on your behalf.

          resourcesVpcConfig -> (structure)
              The  VPC configuration used by the cluster control plane. Amazon
              EKS VPC resources have specific requirements  to  work  properly
              with Kubernetes. For more information, see Cluster VPC consider-
              ations and Cluster security group considerations in  the  Amazon
              EKS User Guide .

              subnetIds -> (list)
                 The subnets associated with your cluster.

                 (string)

              securityGroupIds -> (list)
                 The security groups associated with the cross-account elastic
                 network interfaces that are used to allow  communication  be-
                 tween your nodes and the Kubernetes control plane.

                 (string)

              clusterSecurityGroupId -> (string)
                 The cluster security group that was created by Amazon EKS for
                 the cluster. Managed node groups use this security group  for
                 control-plane-to-data-plane communication.

              vpcId -> (string)
                 The VPC associated with your cluster.

              endpointPublicAccess -> (boolean)
                 Whether the public API server endpoint is enabled.

              endpointPrivateAccess -> (boolean)
                 This  parameter  indicates whether the Amazon EKS private API
                 server endpoint is enabled. If the  Amazon  EKS  private  API
                 server  endpoint  is  enabled,  Kubernetes  API requests that
                 originate from within your cluster's VPC use the private  VPC
                 endpoint instead of traversing the internet. If this value is
                 disabled and you have nodes or Fargate pods in  the  cluster,
                 then  ensure  that  publicAccessCidrs  includes the necessary
                 CIDR blocks for communication with the nodes or Fargate pods.
                 For  more information, see Amazon EKS cluster endpoint access
                 control in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

              publicAccessCidrs -> (list)
                 The CIDR blocks that are allowed  access  to  your  cluster's
                 public Kubernetes API server endpoint.

                 (string)

          kubernetesNetworkConfig -> (structure)
              The Kubernetes network configuration for the cluster.

              serviceIpv4Cidr -> (string)
                 The  CIDR block that Kubernetes Pod and Service object IP ad-
                 dresses are assigned from. Kubernetes assigns addresses  from
                 an  IPv4 CIDR block assigned to a subnet that the node is in.
                 If you didn't specify a CIDR block when you created the clus-
                 ter,  then  Kubernetes  assigns  addresses  from  either  the
                 10.100.0.0/16 or 172.20.0.0/16 CIDR blocks. If this was spec-
                 ified, then it was specified when the cluster was created and
                 it can't be changed.

              serviceIpv6Cidr -> (string)
                 The CIDR block that Kubernetes pod and service  IP  addresses
                 are assigned from if you created a 1.21 or later cluster with
                 version 1.10.1 or later of the  Amazon  VPC  CNI  add-on  and
                 specified ipv6 for ipFamily when you created the cluster. Ku-
                 bernetes assigns service addresses from the unique local  ad-
                 dress  range  (fc00::/7  ) because you can't specify a custom
                 IPv6 CIDR block when you create the cluster.

              ipFamily -> (string)
                 The IP family used to assign Kubernetes Pod and  Service  ob-
                 jects IP addresses. The IP family is always ipv4 , unless you
                 have a 1.21 or later cluster running version 1.10.1 or  later
                 of  the  Amazon  VPC  CNI plugin for Kubernetes and specified
                 ipv6 when you created the cluster.

              elasticLoadBalancing -> (structure)
                 Indicates the current configuration of the load balancing ca-
                 pability  on  your EKS Auto Mode cluster. For example, if the
                 capability is enabled or disabled.

                 enabled -> (boolean)
                     Indicates if the load balancing capability is enabled  on
                     your  EKS  Auto Mode cluster. If the load balancing capa-
                     bility is enabled, EKS Auto Mode will create  and  delete
                     load balancers in your Amazon Web Services account.

          logging -> (structure)
              The logging configuration for your cluster.

                 The  cluster  control  plane  logging  configuration for your
                 cluster.

                 (structure)
                     An object representing the enabled or disabled Kubernetes

                     types -> (list)
                        The available cluster control plane log types.

                        (string)

                     enabled -> (boolean)
                        If  a  log  type is enabled, that log type exports its
                        control plane logs to CloudWatch Logs. If a  log  type
                        isn't  enabled,  that log type doesn't export its con-
                        trol plane logs. Each individual log type can  be  en-
                        abled or disabled independently.

          identity -> (structure)
              The identity provider information for the cluster.

                 with your cluster. Add this to the certificate-authority-data
                 section of the kubeconfig file for your cluster.

          clientRequestToken -> (string)
              A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide  to  ensure
              the idempotency of the request.

          platformVersion -> (string)
              The platform version of your Amazon EKS cluster. For more infor-
              mation about clusters deployed on the Amazon Web Services Cloud,
              see  Platform  versions  in  the * Amazon EKS User Guide * . For
              more information about local clusters deployed  on  an  Outpost,
              see  Amazon  EKS local cluster platform versions in the * Amazon
              EKS User Guide * .

          tags -> (map)
              Metadata that assists with categorization and organization. Each
              tag  consists  of  a key and an optional value. You define both.
              Tags don't propagate to any other cluster or Amazon Web Services
              resources.

              key -> (string)
                 One  part  of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              value -> (string)
                 The  optional  part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

          encryptionConfig -> (list)
              The encryption configuration for the cluster.

              (structure)
                 The encryption configuration for the cluster.

                 resources -> (list)
                     Specifies the resources to be encrypted.  The  only  sup-
                     ported value is secrets .

                     (string)

                 provider -> (structure)
                     Key  Management  Service (KMS) key. Either the ARN or the
                     alias can be used.

                     keyArn -> (string)
                        Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or alias of  the  KMS  key.
                        The  KMS key must be symmetric and created in the same
                        Amazon Web Services Region as the cluster. If the  KMS
                        key  was created in a different account, the IAM prin-
                        cipal must have access to the KMS key. For more infor-
                        mation,  see Allowing users in other accounts to use a
                        KMS key in the Key Management Service Developer  Guide
