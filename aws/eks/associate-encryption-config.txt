ASSOCIATE-ENCRYPTION-CONFIG()                    ASSOCIATE-ENCRYPTION-CONFIG()



NAME
       associate-encryption-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates an encryption configuration to an existing cluster.

       Use  this  API to enable encryption on existing clusters that don't al-
       ready have encryption enabled. This  allows  you  to  implement  a  de-
       fense-in-depth  security strategy without migrating applications to new
       Amazon EKS clusters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of your cluster.

       --encryption-config (list)
          The configuration you are using for encryption.

          (structure)
              The encryption configuration for the cluster.

              resources -> (list)
                 Specifies the resources to be encrypted. The  only  supported
                 value is secrets .

                 (string)

              provider -> (structure)
                 Key Management Service (KMS) key. Either the ARN or the alias
                 can be used.

                 keyArn -> (string)
                     Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or alias of the KMS  key.  The
                     KMS  key must be symmetric and created in the same Amazon
                     Web Services Region as the cluster. If the  KMS  key  was
                     created  in  a  different account, the IAM principal must
                     have access to the KMS key.  For  more  information,  see
                     Allowing  users in other accounts to use a KMS key in the
                     Key Management Service Developer Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          resources=string,string,provider={keyArn=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "resources": ["string", ...],
              "provider": {
                "keyArn": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
