OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the cluster.

       --addon-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  add-on. The name must match one of the names re-
          turned                by                `                 ListAddons
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_ListAddons.html`__
          .

       --addon-version (string)
          The version of the add-on. The version must match one  of  the  ver-
          sions        returned        by        `       DescribeAddonVersions
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAddonVersions.html`__
          .

       --service-account-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of an existing IAM role to bind to
          the add-on's service account. The role must be assigned the IAM per-
          missions  required  by  the add-on. If you don't specify an existing
          IAM role, then the add-on uses the permissions assigned to the  node
          IAM  role. For more information, see Amazon EKS node IAM role in the
          Amazon EKS User Guide .

          NOTE:
              To specify an existing IAM role, you must  have  an  IAM  OpenID
              Connect  (OIDC)  provider created for your cluster. For more in-
              formation, see Enabling IAM roles for service accounts  on  your
              cluster in the Amazon EKS User Guide .

       --resolve-conflicts (string)
          How  to  resolve  field  value conflicts for an Amazon EKS add-on if
          you've changed a value from the Amazon EKS default value.  Conflicts
          are handled based on the option you choose:

          o None  Amazon EKS doesn't change the value. The update might fail.

          o Overwrite   Amazon  EKS  overwrites  the changed value back to the
            Amazon EKS default value.

          o Preserve  Amazon EKS preserves the value. If you choose  this  op-
            tion,  we recommend that you test any field and value changes on a
            non-production cluster before updating the add-on on your  produc-
            tion cluster.

          Possible values:

          o OVERWRITE

          o NONE

          o PRESERVE

       --client-request-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request.

       --configuration-values (string)
          The set of configuration values for the add-on being created.  What-
          ever  values  provided  here  are  validated against the schema from
          DescribeAddonConfiguration

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
