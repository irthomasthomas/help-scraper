LIST-POD-IDENTITY-ASSOCIATIONS()              LIST-POD-IDENTITY-ASSOCIATIONS()



NAME
       list-pod-identity-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       List the EKS Pod Identity associations in a cluster. You can filter the
       list by the namespace that the association is in or the service account
       that the association uses.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-pod-identity-associations  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: associations

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the cluster that the associations are in.

       --namespace (string)
          The name of the Kubernetes namespace inside the cluster that the as-
          sociations are in.

       --service-account (string)
          The  name  of  the  Kubernetes service account that the associations
          use.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       associations -> (list)
          The list of summarized descriptions of the associations that are  in
          the cluster and match any filters that you provided.

          Each  summary is simplified by removing these fields compared to the
          full ``  PodIdentityAssociation `` :

          o The IAM role: roleArn

          o The timestamp that the association was created at: createdAt

          o The most recent timestamp that the association was  modified  at:.
            modifiedAt

          o The tags on the association: tags

          (structure)
              The summarized description of the association.

              o The IAM role: roleArn

              o The timestamp that the association was created at: createdAt

              o The most recent timestamp that the  association  was  modified
                at:. modifiedAt

              o The tags on the association: tags

              clusterName -> (string)
                 The name of the cluster that the association is in.

              namespace -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the Kubernetes namespace inside the cluster to
                 create the association in. The service account and  the  pods
                 that use the service account must be in this namespace.

              serviceAccount -> (string)
                 The name of the Kubernetes service account inside the cluster
                 to associate the IAM credentials with.

              associationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the association.

              associationId -> (string)
                 The ID of the association.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken value to include in a  future  ListPodIdentityAssocia-
          tions request. When the results of a ListPodIdentityAssociations re-
          quest exceed maxResults , you can use this  value  to  retrieve  the
          next  page of results. This value is null when there are no more re-
          sults to return.

          NOTE:
              This token should be treated as an  opaque  identifier  that  is
              used only to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other
              programmatic purposes.
