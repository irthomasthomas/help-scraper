NAME
       create-eks-anywhere-subscription -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  EKS Anywhere subscription. When a subscription is created,
       it is a contract agreement for the length of the term specified in  the
       request.  Licenses that are used to validate support are provisioned in
       Amazon Web Services License Manager and the caller account  is  granted
       access to EKS Anywhere Curated Packages.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The  unique  name  for  your subscription. It must be unique in your
          Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon Web Services Region you're

          characters (case-sensitive), hyphens, and underscores. It must start
          with  an  alphabetic  character and can't be longer than 100 charac-
          ters.

       --term (structure)
          An object representing the term duration and term unit type of  your
          subscription.  This determines the term length of your subscription.
          Valid values are MONTHS for term unit and 12 or 36  for  term  dura-
          tion,  indicating  a  12  month or 36 month subscription. This value
          cannot be changed after creating the subscription.

          duration -> (integer)
              The duration of the subscription term. Valid values are  12  and
              36, indicating a 12 month or 36 month subscription.

          unit -> (string)
              The term unit of the subscription. Valid value is MONTHS .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          duration=integer,unit=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "duration": integer,
            "unit": "MONTHS"
          }

       --license-quantity (integer)
          The number of licenses to purchase with the subscription. Valid val-
          ues are between 1 and 100. This value can't be changed after  creat-
          ing the subscription.

       --license-type (string)
          The  license  type for all licenses in the subscription. Valid value
          is CLUSTER. With the CLUSTER license type, each license covers  sup-
          port for a single EKS Anywhere cluster.

          Possible values:

          o Cluster

       --auto-renew | --no-auto-renew (boolean)
          A boolean indicating whether the subscription auto renews at the end
          of the term.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request.

       --tags (map)
          The  metadata  for  a subscription to assist with categorization and
          organization. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. Sub-
          scription  tags  don't  propagate  to any other resources associated
          with the subscription.

          key -> (string)
              One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a gen-
              eral  label that acts like a category for more specific tag val-
              ues.

          value -> (string)
              The optional part of a key-value pair that  make  up  a  tag.  A
              value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.
