NAME
       delete-pod-identity-association -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a EKS Pod Identity association.

       The  temporary  Amazon  Web  Services credentials from the previous IAM
       role session might still be valid until the session expiry. If you need
       to immediately revoke the temporary session credentials, then go to the
       role in the IAM console.

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The cluster name that

       --association-id (string)
          The ID of the association to be deleted.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       association -> (structure)
          The  full  description  of the EKS Pod Identity association that was
          deleted.

          clusterName -> (string)
              The name of the cluster that the association is in.

          namespace -> (string)
              The name of the Kubernetes namespace inside the cluster to  cre-
              ate  the  association  in. The service account and the pods that
              use the service account must be in this namespace.

          serviceAccount -> (string)
              The name of the Kubernetes service account inside the cluster to
              associate the IAM credentials with.

          roleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to associate with
              the service account. The EKS Pod Identity agent manages  creden-
              tials  to assume this role for applications in the containers in
              the pods that use this service account.

          associationArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the association.

          associationId -> (string)
              The ID of the association.

          tags -> (map)
              The metadata that you apply to a resource to assist with catego-
              rization and organization. Each tag consists of a key and an op-
              tional value. You define both.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource  50

              o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and  each  tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length  128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o Maximum value length  256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and
                resources, remember that other services may have  restrictions
                on  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of such as a prefix for either keys or values  as  it  is  re-
                served  for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete
                tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix  do
                not count against your tags per resource limit.

              key -> (string)
                 One  part  of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              value -> (string)
                 The  optional  part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp that the association was created at.

          modifiedAt -> (timestamp)
              The most recent timestamp that the association was modified at
