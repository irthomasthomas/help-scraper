NAME
       disassociate-identity-provider-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociates an identity provider configuration from a cluster. If you
       disassociate an identity provider from your cluster, users included  in
       the  provider  can no longer access the cluster. However, you can still
       access the cluster with Amazon Web Services IAM users.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the cluster to disassociate an identity provider from.

       --identity-provider-config (structure)
          An object representing an identity provider configuration.

          type -> (string)
              The type of the identity provider configuration. The  only  type
              available is oidc .

          name -> (string)
              The name of the identity provider configuration.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          type=string,name=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "type": "string",
            "name": "string"
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
