DELETE-CANARY()                                                DELETE-CANARY()



NAME
       delete-canary -

DESCRIPTION
       Permanently deletes the specified canary.

       If  you  specify  DeleteLambda  to  true  ,  CloudWatch Synthetics also
       deletes the Lambda functions and layers that are used by the canary.

       Other resources used and created by the canary  are  not  automatically
       deleted. After you delete a canary that you do not intend to use again,
       you should also delete the following:

       o The CloudWatch alarms created for this canary. These  alarms  have  a
         name of
         ``
         Synthetics-Alarm-first-198-characters-of-canary-name -canaryId -alarm
         number ``

       System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 31)
         Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       o Amazon S3 objects and buckets, such as the  canary's  artifact  loca-
         tion.

       o IAM  roles  created  for the canary. If they were created in the con-
         sole, these roles have the name
         ``
         role/service-role/CloudWatchSyntheticsRole-First-21-Characters-of-Ca-
         naryName ``

       System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 35)
         Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       o CloudWatch  Logs log groups created for the canary. These logs groups
         have the name
         ``
         /aws/lambda/cwsyn-First-21-Characters-of-CanaryName ``

       System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 37)
         Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       Before you delete a canary, you might want to use GetCanary to  display
       the  information  about  this  canary. Make note of the information re-
       turned by this operation so that you can delete these  resources  after
       you delete the canary.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the canary that you want to delete. To find the names of
          your canaries, use DescribeCanaries .

       --delete-lambda | --no-delete-lambda (boolean)
          Specifies whether to also delete the  Lambda  functions  and  layers
          used by this canary. The default is false.

          Type: Boolean

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
