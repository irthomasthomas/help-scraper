DELETE-CANARY()                                                DELETE-CANARY()



NAME
       delete-canary -

DESCRIPTION
       Permanently deletes the specified canary.

       If  you  specify  DeleteLambda  to  true  ,  CloudWatch Synthetics also
       deletes the Lambda functions and layers that are used by the canary.

       Other resources used and created by the canary  are  not  automatically
       deleted. After you delete a canary that you do not intend to use again,
       you should also delete the following:

       o The CloudWatch alarms created for this canary. These  alarms  have  a
         name of
         ``
         Synthetics-SharpDrop-Alarm-MyCanaryName `` .

       System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 31)
         Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       o Amazon  S3  objects  and buckets, such as the canary's artifact loca-
         tion.

       o IAM roles created for the canary. If they were created  in  the  con-
         sole, these roles have the name
         ``
         role/service-role/CloudWatchSyntheticsRole-MyCanaryName `` .

       System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 35)
         Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       o CloudWatch  Logs log groups created for the canary. These logs groups
         have the name
         ``
         /aws/lambda/cwsyn-MyCanaryName `` .

       System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 37)
         Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       Before you delete a canary, you might want to use GetCanary to  display
       the  information  about  this  canary. Make note of the information re-
       turned by this operation so that you can delete these  resources  after
       you delete the canary.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-canary
          --name <value>
          [--delete-lambda | --no-delete-lambda]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the canary that you want to delete. To find the names of
          your canaries, use DescribeCanaries .

       --delete-lambda | --no-delete-lambda (boolean)
          Specifies whether to also delete the  Lambda  functions  and  layers
          used by this canary. The default is false.

          Type: Boolean

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
