TAG-RESOURCE()                                                  TAG-RESOURCE()



NAME
       tag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Assigns  one  or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified canary or
       group.

       Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can  also
       use  them  to  scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to
       access or change only resources with certain tag values.

       Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are in-
       terpreted strictly as strings of characters.

       You  can  use  the  TagResource action with a resource that already has
       tags. If you specify a new tag key for the resource, this  tag  is  ap-
       pended to the list of tags associated with the resource. If you specify
       a tag key that is already associated with the  resource,  the  new  tag
       value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag.

       You can associate as many as 50 tags with a canary or group.

SYNOPSIS
            tag-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          --tags <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The ARN of the canary or group that you're adding tags to.

          The ARN format of a canary is
          ``
          arn:aws:synthetics:Region :account-id :canary:canary-name `` .

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 69)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                 The ARN format of a group is
                 ``
                 arn:aws:synthetics:Region :account-id :group:group-name ``

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 73)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       --tags (map)
          The list of key-value pairs to associate with the resource.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
