DESCRIBE-CANARIES-LAST-RUN()                      DESCRIBE-CANARIES-LAST-RUN()



NAME
       describe-canaries-last-run -

DESCRIPTION
       Use  this operation to see information from the most recent run of each
       canary that you have created.

       This operation supports resource-level authorization using an IAM  pol-
       icy  and  the  Names parameter. If you specify the Names parameter, the
       operation is successful only if you have authorization to view all  the
       canaries  that  you specify in your request. If you do not have permis-
       sion to view any of the canaries, the request  fails  with  a  403  re-
       sponse.

       You  are  required to use the Names parameter if you are logged on to a
       user or role that has an IAM policy that restricts which canaries  that
       you  are  allowed to view. For more information, see Limiting a user to
       viewing specific canaries .

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A token that indicates that there is more data  available.  You  can
          use  this token in a subsequent DescribeCanariesLastRun operation to
          retrieve the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specify this parameter to limit how many runs are returned each time
          you  use  the DescribeLastRun operation. If you omit this parameter,
          the default of 100 is used.

       --names (list)
          Use this parameter to return only canaries that match the names that
          you specify here. You can specify as many as five canary names.

          If  you  specify this parameter, the operation is successful only if
          you have authorization to view all the canaries that you specify  in
          your  request.  If you do not have permission to view any of the ca-
          naries, the request fails with a 403 response.

          You are required to use the Names parameter if you are logged on  to
          a  user or role that has an IAM policy that restricts which canaries
          that you are allowed to view. For more information, see  Limiting  a
          user to viewing specific canaries .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
