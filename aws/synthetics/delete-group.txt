DELETE-GROUP()                                                  DELETE-GROUP()



NAME
       delete-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  group. The group doesn't need to be empty to be deleted. If
       there are canaries in the group, they are not deleted when  you  delete
       the group.

       Groups  are  a  global resource that appear in all Regions, but the re-
       quest to delete a group must be made from its home Region. You can find
       the home Region of a group within its ARN.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-group
          --group-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group-identifier (string)
          Specifies which group to delete. You can specify the group name, the
          ARN, or the group ID as the GroupIdentifier .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
