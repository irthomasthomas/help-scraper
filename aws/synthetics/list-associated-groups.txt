NAME
       list-associated-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of the groups that the specified canary is associated
       with. The canary that you specify must be in the current Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-associated-groups
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A token that indicates that there is more data  available.  You  can
          use this token in a subsequent operation to retrieve the next set of
          results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specify this parameter to limit how many groups  are  returned  each
          time  you  use  the ListAssociatedGroups operation. If you omit this
          parameter, the default of 20 is used.

       --resource-arn (string)
          The ARN of the canary that you want to view groups for.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Groups -> (list)
          An  array  of  structures  that contain information about the groups
          that this canary is associated with.

          (structure)
              A structure containing some information about a group.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique ID of the group.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the group.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the group.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates that there is more data  available.  You  can
          use this token in a subsequent ListAssociatedGroups operation to re-
          trieve the next set of results.
