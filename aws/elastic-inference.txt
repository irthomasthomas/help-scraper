DESCRIPTION
       Elastic Inference public APIs.

       February  15,  2023:  Starting April 15, 2023, AWS will not onboard new
       customers to Amazon Elastic Inference (EI), and will help current  cus-
       tomers  migrate  their workloads to options that offer better price and
       performance. After April 15, 2023, new customers will not  be  able  to
       launch  instances with Amazon EI accelerators in Amazon SageMaker, Ama-
       zon ECS, or Amazon EC2. However, customers who have used Amazon  EI  at
       least  once  during  the past 30-day period are considered current cus-
       tomers and will be able to continue using the service.
