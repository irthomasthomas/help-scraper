DISCOVERY()                                                        DISCOVERY()



NAME
       discovery -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service helps you plan appli-
       cation migration projects. It automatically identifies servers, virtual
       machines  (VMs), and network dependencies in your on-premises data cen-
       ters. For more information, see the  Amazon  Web  Services  Application
       Discovery Service FAQ . Application Discovery Service offers three ways
       of performing discovery and  collecting  data  about  your  on-premises
       servers:

       o Agentless  discovery  is recommended for environments that use VMware
         vCenter Server. This mode doesn't require you to install an agent  on
         each host. It does not work in non-VMware environments.

         o Agentless  discovery  gathers  server information regardless of the
           operating systems, which minimizes the time  required  for  initial
           on-premises infrastructure assessment.

         o Agentless  discovery  doesn't collect information about network de-
           pendencies, only agent-based discovery collects that information.

       o Agent-based discovery collects a richer set of  data  than  agentless
         discovery  by  using  the  Amazon  Web Services Application Discovery
         Agent, which you install on one or more hosts in your data center.

         o The agent captures infrastructure and application information,  in-
           cluding  an  inventory of running processes, system performance in-
           formation, resource utilization, and network dependencies.

         o The information collected by agents is secured at rest and in tran-
           sit to the Application Discovery Service database in the cloud.

       o Amazon  Web  Services  Partner Network (APN) solutions integrate with
         Application Discovery Service, enabling you to import details of your
         on-premises environment directly into Migration Hub without using the
         discovery connector or discovery agent.

         o Third-party application discovery tools can query Amazon  Web  Ser-
           vices  Application Discovery Service, and they can write to the Ap-
           plication Discovery Service database using the public API.

         o In this way, you can import data into Migration Hub and view it, so
           that  you  can associate applications with servers and track migra-
           tions.
          Recommendations

       We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environ-
       ments,  and  whenever you want to collect information about network de-
       pendencies. You can run agent-based and agentless discovery  simultane-
       ously.  Use  agentless discovery to complete the initial infrastructure
       assessment quickly, and then install agents on select hosts to  collect
       additional information.
          Working With This Guide

       This  API  reference  provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples
       for each of the actions and data types for Application  Discovery  Ser-
       vice.  The  topic  for each action shows the API request parameters and
       the response. Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services
       SDKs  to  access an API that is tailored to the programming language or
       platform that you're using. For more information, see Amazon  Web  Ser-
       vices SDKs .

       NOTE:

          o Remember  that  you must set your Migration Hub home region before
            you call any of these APIs.

          o You must make API calls for write actions (create,  notify,  asso-
            ciate, disassociate, import, or put) while in your home region, or
            a HomeRegionNotSetException error is returned.

          o API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete)  are
            permitted outside of your home region.

          o Although  it  is  unlikely,  the  Migration  Hub home region could
            change. If you call APIs outside the home region, an  InvalidInpu-
            tException is returned.

          o You  must  call  GetHomeRegion  to obtain the latest Migration Hub
            home region.

       WARNING:
          All  data  is  handled  according to the Amazon Web Services Privacy
          Policy . You can operate Application Discovery  Service  offline  to
          inspect collected data before it is shared with the service.
