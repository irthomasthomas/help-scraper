DISCOVERY()                                                        DISCOVERY()



NAME
       discovery -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Web Services Application Discovery Service (Application Discov-
       ery Service) helps you plan application migration projects. It automat-
       ically  identifies  servers, virtual machines (VMs), and network depen-
       dencies in your on-premises data centers. For more information, see the
       Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service FAQ .

       Application Discovery Service offers three ways of performing discovery
       and collecting data about your on-premises servers:

       o Agentless discovery using Amazon Web Services  Application  Discovery
         Service  Agentless Collector (Agentless Collector), which doesn't re-
         quire you to install an agent on each host.

         o Agentless Collector gathers server information  regardless  of  the
           operating  systems,  which  minimizes the time required for initial
           on-premises infrastructure assessment.

         o Agentless Collector doesn't collect information about  network  de-
           pendencies, only agent-based discovery collects that information.

       o Agent-based  discovery using the Amazon Web Services Application Dis-
         covery Agent (Application Discovery Agent) collects a richer  set  of
         data than agentless discovery, which you install on one or more hosts
         in your data center.

         o The agent captures infrastructure and application information,  in-
           cluding  an  inventory of running processes, system performance in-
           formation, resource utilization, and network dependencies.

         o The information collected by agents is secured at rest and in tran-
           sit to the Application Discovery Service database in the Amazon Web
           Services cloud. For more information, see Amazon Web  Services  Ap-
           plication Discovery Agent .

       o Amazon  Web  Services  Partner Network (APN) solutions integrate with
         Application Discovery Service, enabling you to import details of your
         on-premises  environment  directly into Amazon Web Services Migration
         Hub (Migration Hub) without using Agentless Collector or  Application
         Discovery Agent.

         o Third-party  application  discovery tools can query Amazon Web Ser-
           vices Application Discovery Service, and they can write to the  Ap-
           plication Discovery Service database using the public API.

         o In this way, you can import data into Migration Hub and view it, so
           that you can associate applications with servers and  track  migra-
           tions.
          Working With This Guide

       This  API  reference  provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples
       for each of the actions and data types for Application  Discovery  Ser-
       vice.  The  topic  for each action shows the API request parameters and
       the response. Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services
       SDKs  to  access an API that is tailored to the programming language or
       platform that you're using. For more information, see Amazon  Web  Ser-
       vices SDKs .

       NOTE:

          o Remember  that  you must set your Migration Hub home Region before
            you call any of these APIs.

          o You must make API calls for write actions (create,  notify,  asso-
            ciate, disassociate, import, or put) while in your home Region, or
            a HomeRegionNotSetException error is returned.

          o API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete)  are
            permitted outside of your home Region.

          o Although  it  is  unlikely,  the  Migration  Hub home Region could
            change. If you call APIs outside the home Region, an  InvalidInpu-
            tException is returned.

          o You  must  call  GetHomeRegion  to obtain the latest Migration Hub
            home Region.

       WARNING:
          All  data  is  handled  according to the Amazon Web Services Privacy
          Policy . You can operate Application Discovery  Service  offline  to
          inspect collected data before it is shared with the service.
