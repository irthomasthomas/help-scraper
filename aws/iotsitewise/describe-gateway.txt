SYNOPSIS
            describe-gateway
          --gateway-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the gateway device.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe a gateway

       The following describe-gateway example describes a gateway.

          aws iotsitewise describe-gateway \
              --gateway-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-1a1a1EXAMPLE

OUTPUT
       gatewayId -> (string)
          The ID of the gateway device.

       gatewayName -> (string)
          The name of the gateway.

       gatewayArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the gateway, which has the following format.
              arn:${Partition}:iotsitewise:${Region}:${Account}:gate-
              way/${GatewayId}

       gatewayPlatform -> (structure)
          The gateway's platform.

          greengrass -> (structure)
              A gateway that runs on IoT Greengrass.

              groupArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the Greengrass group. For more  information  about
                 how to find a group's ARN, see ListGroups and GetGroup in the
                 IoT Greengrass V1 API Reference .

          greengrassV2 -> (structure)
              A gateway that runs on IoT Greengrass V2.

              coreDeviceThingName -> (string)
                 The name of the IoT thing for your IoT Greengrass V2 core de-
                 vice.

          siemensIE -> (structure)
              A  SiteWise  Edge gateway that runs on a Siemens Industrial Edge
              Device.

              iotCoreThingName -> (string)
                 The name of the IoT Thing for your SiteWise Edge gateway.

       gatewayCapabilitySummaries -> (list)
          A list of gateway capability summaries that each contain a namespace
          and  status.  Each  gateway  capability defines data sources for the
          gateway. To retrieve a capability  configuration's  definition,  use
          DescribeGatewayCapabilityConfiguration .

          (structure)
              Contains a summary of a gateway capability configuration.

              capabilityNamespace -> (string)
                 The  namespace  of the capability configuration. For example,
                 if you configure OPC-UA sources from the  IoT  SiteWise  con-
                 sole,  your OPC-UA capability configuration has the namespace
                 iotsitewise:opcuacollector:version , where version is a  num-
                 ber such as 1 .

              capabilitySyncStatus -> (string)
                 The  synchronization  status of the capability configuration.
                 The sync status can be one of the following:

                 o IN_SYNC  The gateway is running the  capability  configura-
                   tion.

                 o NOT_APPLICABLE   Synchronization  is  not required for this
                   capability configuration. This is most  common  when  inte-
                   grating  partner data sources, because the data integration
                   is handled externally by the partner.

                 o OUT_OF_SYNC  The gateway  hasn't  received  the  capability
                   configuration.

                 o SYNC_FAILED  The gateway rejected the capability configura-
                   tion.

                 o UNKNOWN  The synchronization status  is  currently  unknown
                   due to an undetermined or temporary error.

       creationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the gateway was created, in Unix epoch time.

       lastUpdateDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the gateway was last updated, in Unix epoch time.
