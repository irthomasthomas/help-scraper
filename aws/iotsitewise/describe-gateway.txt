DESCRIBE-GATEWAY()                                          DESCRIBE-GATEWAY()



NAME
       describe-gateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about a gateway.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-gateway
          --gateway-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the gateway device.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe a gateway

       The following describe-gateway example describes a gateway.

          aws iotsitewise describe-gateway \
              --gateway-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-1a1a1EXAMPLE

                      "capabilitySyncStatus": "IN_SYNC"
                  }
              ],

          }

OUTPUT
       gatewayId -> (string)
          The ID of the gateway device.

       gatewayName -> (string)
          The name of the gateway.

       gatewayArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the gateway, which has the following format.
              arn:${Partition}:iotsitewise:${Region}:${Account}:gate-
              way/${GatewayId}

       gatewayPlatform -> (structure)
          The gateway's platform.

          greengrass -> (structure)
              A gateway that runs on IoT Greengrass.

              groupArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of the Greengrass group. For more information about
                 how to find a group's ARN, see ListGroups and GetGroup in the
                 IoT Greengrass API Reference .

          greengrassV2 -> (structure)
              A gateway that runs on IoT Greengrass V2.

              coreDeviceThingName -> (string)
                 The name of the IoT thing for your IoT Greengrass V2 core de-
                 vice.

       gatewayCapabilitySummaries -> (list)
          A list of gateway capability summaries that each contain a namespace
          and  status.  Each  gateway  capability defines data sources for the
          gateway. To retrieve a capability  configuration's  definition,  use
          DescribeGatewayCapabilityConfiguration .

          (structure)
              Contains a summary of a gateway capability configuration.

              capabilityNamespace -> (string)
                 The  namespace  of the capability configuration. For example,
                 if you configure OPC-UA sources from the  IoT  SiteWise  con-
                 sole,  your OPC-UA capability configuration has the namespace
                 iotsitewise:opcuacollector:version , where version is a  num-
                 ber such as 1 .

              capabilitySyncStatus -> (string)
                 The  synchronization  status of the capability configuration.
                 The sync status can be one of the following:

                 o IN_SYNC  The gateway is running the  capability  configura-
                   tion.

                 o OUT_OF_SYNC   The  gateway  hasn't  received the capability
                   configuration.

                 o SYNC_FAILED  The gateway rejected the capability configura-
                   tion.

       creationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the gateway was created, in Unix epoch time.

       lastUpdateDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the gateway was last updated, in Unix epoch time.
