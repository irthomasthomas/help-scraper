CREATE-GATEWAY()                                              CREATE-GATEWAY()



NAME
       create-gateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a gateway, which is a virtual or edge device that delivers in-
       dustrial data streams from local servers to IoT SiteWise. For more  in-
       formation,  see Ingesting data using a gateway in the IoT SiteWise User
       Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-gateway
          --gateway-name <value>
          --gateway-platform <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-name (string)
          A unique, friendly name for the gateway.

       --gateway-platform (structure)
          The gateway's platform. You can only specify one platform in a gate-
          way.

          greengrass -> (structure)
              A gateway that runs on IoT Greengrass.

              groupArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of the Greengrass group. For more information about
                 how to find a group's ARN, see ListGroups and GetGroup in the
                 IoT Greengrass API Reference .

          greengrassV2 -> (structure)
              A gateway that runs on IoT Greengrass V2.

              coreDeviceThingName -> (string)
                 The name of the IoT thing for your IoT Greengrass V2 core de-
                 vice.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          greengrass={groupArn=string},greengrassV2={coreDeviceThingName=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "greengrass": {
              "groupArn": "string"
            },
            "greengrassV2": {
              "coreDeviceThingName": "string"
            }
          }

       --tags (map)
          A list of key-value pairs that contain metadata for the gateway. For
          more information, see Tagging your IoT SiteWise resources in the IoT
          SiteWise User Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a gateway

       The following create-gateway example creates a gateway that runs on AWS
       IoT Greengrass.

          aws iotsitewise create-gateway \
              --gateway-name ExampleCorpGateway \
              --gateway-platform greengrass={groupArn=arn:aws:greengrass:us-west-2:123456789012:/greengrass/groups/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-1b1b1EXAMPLE}

       Output:

          {
              "gatewayId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-1a1a1EXAMPLE",
              "gatewayArn": "arn:aws:iotsitewise:us-west-2:123456789012:gateway/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-1a1a1EXAMPLE"
          }

       For more information, see Configuring a gateway in the AWS IoT SiteWise
       User Guide.

OUTPUT
       gatewayId -> (string)
          The ID of the gateway device. You can use  this  ID  when  you  call
          other IoT SiteWise APIs.

       gatewayArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the gateway, which has the following format.
              arn:${Partition}:iotsitewise:${Region}:${Account}:gate-
              way/${GatewayId}



                                                              CREATE-GATEWAY()
