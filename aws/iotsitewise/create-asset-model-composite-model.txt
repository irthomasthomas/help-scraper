NAME
       create-asset-model-composite-model -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a custom composite model from specified property and hierarchy
       definitions. There are two types of custom composite models, inline and
       component-model-based .

       Use  component-model-based  custom composite models to define standard,
       reusable components. A  component-model-based  custom  composite  model
       consists of a name, a description, and the ID of the component model it
       references. A component-model-based custom composite model has no prop-
       erties  of its own; its referenced component model provides its associ-
       ated properties to any created assets. For more information, see Custom
       composite models (Components) in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       Use inline custom composite models to organize the properties of an as-
       set model. The properties of inline custom composite models  are  local
       to  the asset model where they are included and can't be used to create
       multiple assets.

       To create a component-model-based model, specify the  composedAssetMod-
       elId  of an existing asset model with assetModelType of COMPONENT_MODEL
       .

       To create an inline model, specify the  assetModelCompositeModelProper-
       ties and don't include an composedAssetModelId .

OPTIONS
       --asset-model-id (string)
          The ID of the asset model this composite model is a part of.

       --parent-asset-model-composite-model-id (string)
          The  ID  of the parent composite model in this asset model relation-
          ship.

       --asset-model-composite-model-external-id (string)
          An external ID to assign to the composite model.

          If the composite model is a derived composite model, or  one  nested
          inside a component model, you can only set the external ID using Up-
          dateAssetModelCompositeModel and specifying the derived  ID  of  the
          model or property from the created model it's a part of.

       --asset-model-composite-model-id (string)
          The  ID of the composite model. IoT SiteWise automatically generates
          a unique ID for you, so this parameter is never  required.  However,
          if you prefer to supply your own ID instead, you can specify it here
          in UUID format. If you specify your own  ID,  it  must  be  globally
          unique.

       --asset-model-composite-model-description (string)
          A description for the composite model.

       --asset-model-composite-model-name (string)
          A unique, friendly name for the composite model.

       --asset-model-composite-model-type (string)
          The  composite  model type. Valid values are AWS/ALARM , CUSTOM , or
          AWS/L4E_ANOMALY .

       --client-token (string)
          A unique case-sensitive identifier that you can  provide  to  ensure
          the  idempotency  of the request. Don't reuse this client token if a
          new idempotent request is required.

       --composed-asset-model-id (string)
          The ID of a composite model on this asset.

       --asset-model-composite-model-properties (list)
          The property definitions of the composite model. For  more  informa-
          tion, see <LINK>.

          You  can  specify up to 200 properties per composite model. For more
          information, see Quotas in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

          (structure)
              Contains an asset model property definition. This property defi-
              nition is applied to all assets created from the asset model.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the property definition.

              dataType -> (string)
                 The data type of the property definition.

                 If you specify STRUCT , you must also specify dataTypeSpec to
                 identify the type of the structure for this property.

              dataTypeSpec -> (string)
                 The data type of the structure for this property. This param-
                 eter  is  required  on  properties  that have the STRUCT data
                 type.

                 The options for this parameter depend on the type of the com-
                 posite   model   in  which  you  define  this  property.  Use
                 AWS/ALARM_STATE for alarm state in alarm composite models.

              unit -> (string)
                 The unit of the property definition, such as Newtons or RPM .

              type -> (structure)
                 The property definition type (see  PropertyType  ).  You  can
                 only specify one type in a property definition.

                 attribute -> (structure)
                     Specifies  an asset attribute property. An attribute gen-
                     erally contains static information, such  as  the  serial
                     number of an IIoT wind turbine.

                     defaultValue -> (string)
                        The  default  value of the asset model property attri-
                        bute. All assets that you create from the asset  model
                        contain this attribute value. You can update an attri-
                        bute's value after you create an asset. For  more  in-
                        formation,  see  Updating  attribute values in the IoT
                        SiteWise User Guide .

                 measurement -> (structure)
                     Specifies an asset measurement  property.  A  measurement
                     represents  a  device's  raw  sensor data stream, such as
                     timestamped temperature values or timestamped power  val-
                     ues.

                     processingConfig -> (structure)
                        The processing configuration for the given measurement
                        property. You can configure measurements to be kept at
                        the  edge  or  forwarded  to  the  Amazon Web Services
                        Cloud. By default, measurements are forwarded  to  the

                            surement property.

                            state -> (string)
                               The forwarding state for the given property.

                 transform -> (structure)
                     Specifies an asset transform property. A  transform  con-
                     tains  a  mathematical  expression that maps a property's
                     data points from one form to another, such as a unit con-
                     version from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

                     expression -> (string)
                        The mathematical expression that defines the transfor-
                        mation function. You can specify up  to  10  variables
                        per expression. You can specify up to 10 functions per
                        expression.

                            name -> (string)
                               The friendly name of the variable to be used in
                               the expression.

                            value -> (structure)
                               The variable that identifies an asset  property
                               from which to use values.

                               propertyId -> (string)
                                   The  ID of the property to use as the vari-
                                   able. You can use the property name if it's
                                   from  the same asset model. If the property
                                   has an external ID, you can specify  exter-
                                   nalId:  followed  by  the  external ID. For
                                   more information, see Using external IDs in
                                   the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                               hierarchyId -> (string)
                                   The  ID  of  the hierarchy to query for the
                                   property ID. You can  use  the  hierarchy's
                                   name  instead of the hierarchy's ID. If the
                                   hierarchy has an external ID, you can spec-
                                   ify  externalId:  followed  by the external
                                   ID. For more information, see Using  exter-
                                   nal IDs in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                                   You  use  a hierarchy ID instead of a model
                                   ID because you can have several hierarchies
                                   using the same model and therefore the same
                                   propertyId . For example,  you  might  have
                                   separately  grouped  assets  that come from
                                   the same asset model. For more information,
                                   see  Asset  hierarchies in the IoT SiteWise

                     process all input data points over a  time  interval  and
                     output  a single data point, such as to calculate the av-
                     erage hourly temperature.

                     expression -> (string)
                        The mathematical expression that  defines  the  metric
                        aggregation  function.  You can specify up to 10 vari-

                               from which to use values.

                               propertyId -> (string)
                                   The ID of the property to use as the  vari-
                                   able. You can use the property name if it's
                                   from the same asset model. If the  property
                                   has  an external ID, you can specify exter-
                                   nalId: followed by  the  external  ID.  For

                                   name instead of the hierarchy's ID. If  the
                                   hierarchy has an external ID, you can spec-
                                   ify externalId: followed  by  the  external
                                   ID.  For more information, see Using exter-
                                   nal IDs in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                                   You use a hierarchy ID instead of  a  model
                                   ID because you can have several hierarchies
                                   using the same model and therefore the same
                                   propertyId  .  For  example, you might have

                                          The name of the path segment.

                     window -> (structure)
                        The window (time interval)  over  which  IoT  SiteWise
                        computes  the  metric's  aggregation  expression.  IoT
                        SiteWise computes one data point per window .

                        tumbling -> (structure)
                            The tumbling time interval window.

                            interval -> (string)
                               The time interval for the tumbling window.  The
                               interval  time  must  be between 1 minute and 1
                               week.

                               IoT SiteWise computes the 1w interval  the  end
                               of  Sunday  at midnight each week (UTC), the 1d
                               interval at the end of  each  day  at  midnight
                               (UTC), the 1h interval at the end of each hour,
                               and so on.

                               When IoT SiteWise aggregates  data  points  for
                               metric computations, the start of each interval
                               is exclusive and the end of  each  interval  is
                               inclusive.  IoT  SiteWise  places  the computed
                               data point at the end of the interval.

                            offset -> (string)
                               The offset for the tumbling window. The  offset
                               parameter accepts the following:

                               o The  offset time. For example, if you specify
                                 18h for offset and  1d  for  interval  ,  IoT
                                 SiteWise  aggregates  data in one of the fol-
                                 lowing ways:

                                 o If you create the metric before or at 6  PM
                                   (UTC), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at 6 PM (UTC) on the day  when  you  create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If  you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC),
                                   you get the first aggregation result  at  6
                                   PM (UTC) the next day.

                               o The  ISO  8601  format.  For  example, if you
                                 specify PT18H for offset and 1d for  interval
                                 ,  IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the
                                 following ways:

                                 o If you create the metric before or at 6  PM
                                   (UTC), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at 6 PM (UTC) on the day  when  you  create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If  you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC),
                                   you get the first aggregation result  at  6
                                   PM (UTC) the next day.

                               o The  24-hour clock. For example, if you spec-
                                 ify 00:03:00 for offset , 5m for  interval  ,
                                 and  you create the metric at 2 PM (UTC), you
                                 get the first aggregation result at  2:03  PM
                                 (UTC).  You get the second aggregation result
                                 at 2:08 PM (UTC).

                               o The offset time zone.  For  example,  if  you
                                 specify 2021-07-23T18:00-08 for offset and 1d
                                 for interval , IoT SiteWise  aggregates  data
                                 in one of the following ways:

                                 o If  you create the metric before or at 6 PM
                                   (PST), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at  6  PM  (PST) on the day when you create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If you create the metric after 6 PM  (PST),
                                   you  get  the first aggregation result at 6
                                   PM (PST) the next day.

                     processingConfig -> (structure)
                        The processing  configuration  for  the  given  metric
                        property.  You can configure metrics to be computed at
                        the edge or in the Amazon Web Services Cloud.  By  de-
                        fault, metrics are forwarded to the cloud.

                        computeLocation -> (string)
                            The  compute  location  for the given metric prop-
                            erty.

              id -> (string)
                 The ID to assign to the asset model property, if desired. IoT
                 SiteWise automatically generates a unique ID for you, so this
                 parameter is never required. However, if you prefer to supply
                 your  own ID instead, you can specify it here in UUID format.
                 If you specify your own ID, it must be globally unique.

              externalId -> (string)
                 An external ID to assign to the property definition. The  ex-
                 ternal  ID  must  be unique among property definitions within
                 this asset model. For more information,  see  Using  external
                 IDs in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
