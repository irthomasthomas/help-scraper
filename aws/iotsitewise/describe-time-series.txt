NAME
       describe-time-series -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about a time series (data stream).

       To identify a time series, do one of the following:

       o If  the  time series isn't associated with an asset property, specify
         the alias of the time series.

       o If the time series is associated with an asset property, specify  one
         of the following:

         o The alias of the time series.

         o The assetId and propertyId that identifies the asset property.

OPTIONS
       --alias (string)
          The alias that identifies the time series.

       --asset-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the asset in which the asset property was created. This
          can be either the actual ID in UUID format, or else externalId: fol-
          lowed  by  the external ID, if it has one. For more information, see
          Referencing objects with external IDs in the IoT SiteWise User Guide
          .

       --property-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the asset property. This can be either the actual ID in
          UUID format, or else externalId: followed by the external ID, if  it
          has one. For more information, see Referencing objects with external
          IDs in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       assetId -> (string)
          The ID of the asset in which the asset property was created.

       propertyId -> (string)
          The ID of the asset property, in UUID format.

       alias -> (string)
          The alias that identifies the time series.

       timeSeriesId -> (string)
          The ID of the time series.

       dataType -> (string)
          The data type of the time series.

          If you specify STRUCT , you must also specify dataTypeSpec to  iden-
          tify the type of the structure for this time series.

       dataTypeSpec -> (string)
          The  data type of the structure for this time series. This parameter
          is required for time series that have the STRUCT data type.

          The options for this parameter depend on the type of  the  composite
          model  in  which  you  created the asset property that is associated
          with your time series. Use AWS/ALARM_STATE for alarm state in  alarm
          composite models.

       timeSeriesCreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date that the time series was created, in Unix epoch time.

       timeSeriesLastUpdateDate -> (timestamp)
          The date that the time series was last updated, in Unix epoch time.

       timeSeriesArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the time series, which has the following format.
              arn:${Partition}:iotsitewise:${Region}:${Account}:time-se-
              ries/${TimeSeriesId}
