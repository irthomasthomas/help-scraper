       --job-name (string)
          The unique name that helps identify the job request.

       --job-role-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of the IAM role that allows IoT SiteWise to read Amazon S3
          data.

       --files (list)
          The files in the specified Amazon S3 bucket that contain your data.

          (structure)
              The file in Amazon S3 where your data is saved.

              bucket -> (string)
                 The name of the Amazon S3 bucket from which data is imported.

              key -> (string)
                 The key of the Amazon S3 object that contains your data. Each
                 object has a key that is a unique identifier. Each object has
                 exactly one key.

              versionId -> (string)
                 The version ID to identify a specific version of  the  Amazon
                 S3 object that contains your data.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bucket=string,key=string,versionId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "bucket": "string",
              "key": "string",
              "versionId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --error-report-location (structure)
          The  Amazon S3 destination where errors associated with the job cre-
          ation request are saved.

          bucket -> (string)
              The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to which errors associated with
              the bulk import job are sent.

          prefix -> (string)
              Amazon  S3  uses the prefix as a folder name to organize data in
              the bucket. Each Amazon S3 object has a key that is  its  unique
              identifier  in  the  bucket. Each object in a bucket has exactly
              one key. The prefix must end with a forward slash (/). For  more
              information, see Organizing objects using prefixes in the Amazon
              Simple Storage Service User Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bucket=string,prefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "bucket": "string",
            "prefix": "string"
          }

       --job-configuration (structure)

          format used to save data in Amazon S3.

          fileFormat -> (structure)

                     (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "fileFormat": {
              "csv": {
                "columnNames": ["ALIAS"|"ASSET_ID"|"PROPERTY_ID"|"DATA_TYPE"|"TIMESTAMP_SECONDS"|"TIMESTAMP_NANO_OFFSET"|"QUALITY"|"VALUE", ...]
              }
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
