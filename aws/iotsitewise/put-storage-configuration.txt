OPTIONS
       --storage-type (string)
          The  storage  tier that you specified for your data. The storageType
          parameter can be one of the following values:

          o SITEWISE_DEFAULT_STORAGE  IoT SiteWise saves your  data  into  the
            hot tier. The hot tier is a service-managed database.

          o MULTI_LAYER_STORAGE  IoT SiteWise saves your data in both the cold
            tier and the hot tier. The cold tier is a customer-managed  Amazon
            S3 bucket.

          Possible values:

          o SITEWISE_DEFAULT_STORAGE

          o MULTI_LAYER_STORAGE

       --multi-layer-storage (structure)
          Identifies a storage destination. If you specified MULTI_LAYER_STOR-
          AGE for the storage type, you must specify a  MultiLayerStorage  ob-
          ject.

          customerManagedS3Storage -> (structure)
              Contains information about a customer managed Amazon S3 bucket.

              s3ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of the Amazon S3 object. For more information about
                 how to find the ARN for an Amazon S3 object,  see  Amazon  S3
                 resources in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide .

              roleArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of the Identity and Access Management role that al-
                 lows IoT SiteWise to send data to Amazon S3.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          customerManagedS3Storage={s3ResourceArn=string,roleArn=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "customerManagedS3Storage": {
              "s3ResourceArn": "string",
              "roleArn": "string"
            }
          }

       --disassociated-data-storage (string)
          Contains the storage configuration for time  series  (data  streams)
          that  aren't  associated  with  asset properties. The disassociated-
          DataStorage can be one of the following values:

          o ENABLED  IoT SiteWise accepts time series that  aren't  associated
            with asset properties.

          WARNING:
              After the disassociatedDataStorage is enabled, you can't disable
              it.

          o DISABLED  IoT SiteWise doesn't accept time series  (data  streams)
            that aren't associated with asset properties.

          For  more  information,  see  Data  streams in the IoT SiteWise User
          Guide .

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DISABLED

       --retention-period (structure)
          The number of days your data is kept in the hot  tier.  By  default,
          your data is kept indefinitely in the hot tier.

          numberOfDays -> (integer)
              The number of days that your data is kept.

              NOTE:
                 If  you  specified  a value for this parameter, the unlimited
                 parameter must be false .

          unlimited -> (boolean)
              If true, your data is kept indefinitely.

              NOTE:
                 If configured to true , you must not specify a value for  the
                 numberOfDays parameter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          numberOfDays=integer,unlimited=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "numberOfDays": integer,
            "unlimited": true|false
          }

       --warm-tier (string)
          A  service managed storage tier optimized for analytical queries. It
          stores periodically uploaded, buffered and historical data  ingested
          with the CreaeBulkImportJob API.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DISABLED

       --warm-tier-retention-period (structure)
          Set  this period to specify how long your data is stored in the warm
          tier before it is deleted. You can set this only if cold tier is en-
          abled.

          numberOfDays -> (integer)
              The number of days the data is stored in the warm tier.

          unlimited -> (boolean)
              If  set  to  true,  the  data is stored indefinitely in the warm
              tier.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          numberOfDays=integer,unlimited=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "numberOfDays": integer,
            "unlimited": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
