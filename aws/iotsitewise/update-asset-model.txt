UPDATE-ASSET-MODEL()                                      UPDATE-ASSET-MODEL()



NAME
       update-asset-model -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates an asset model and all of the assets that were created from the
       model. Each asset created from the model  inherits  the  updated  asset
       model's  property  and hierarchy definitions. For more information, see
       Updating assets and models in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       WARNING:
          If you remove a property from an asset model, IoT  SiteWise  deletes
          all  previous  data  for  that property. You cant change the type or
          data type of an existing property.

          To replace an existing asset model property with a new one with  the
          same name , do the following:

          o Submit  an UpdateAssetModel request with the entire existing prop-
            erty removed.

          o Submit a second UpdateAssetModel request  that  includes  the  new
            property.  The  new  asset property will have the same name as the
            previous one and IoT SiteWise will generate a new unique id .

OPTIONS
       --asset-model-id (string)
          The ID of the asset model to update. This can be either  the  actual
          ID  in UUID format, or else externalId: followed by the external ID,
          if it has one. For more information, see  Referencing  objects  with
          external IDs in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       --asset-model-name (string)
          A unique name for the asset model.

       --asset-model-description (string)
          A description for the asset model.

       --asset-model-properties (list)
          The updated property definitions of the asset model. For more infor-
          mation, see Asset properties in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

          You can specify up to 200 properties per asset model. For  more  in-
          formation, see Quotas in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

          (structure)
              Contains information about an asset model property.

              id -> (string)
                 The ID of the asset model property.

                 o If  you are callling UpdateAssetModel to create a new prop-
                   erty: You can specify its ID here, if desired. IoT SiteWise
                   automatically generates a unique ID for you, so this param-
                   eter is never required. However, if you  prefer  to  supply
                   your  own  ID instead, you can specify it here in UUID for-
                   mat. If you specify  your  own  ID,  it  must  be  globally
                   unique.

                 o If  you  are calling UpdateAssetModel to modify an existing
                   property: This can be either the actual ID in UUID  format,
                   or  else externalId: followed by the external ID, if it has
                   one. For more information, see Referencing objects with ex-
                   ternal IDs in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                 The data type of the asset model property.

              dataTypeSpec -> (string)
                 The data type of the structure for this property. This param-
                 eter exists on properties that have the STRUCT data type.

              unit -> (string)
                 The unit of the asset model property, such as Newtons or  RPM
                 .

              type -> (structure)
                 The property type (see PropertyType ).

                 attribute -> (structure)
                     Specifies  an asset attribute property. An attribute gen-
                     erally contains static information, such  as  the  serial
                     number of an IIoT wind turbine.

                     defaultValue -> (string)
                        The  default  value of the asset model property attri-
                        bute. All assets that you create from the asset  model
                        contain this attribute value. You can update an attri-
                        bute's value after you create an asset. For  more  in-
                        formation,  see  Updating  attribute values in the IoT
                        SiteWise User Guide .

                 measurement -> (structure)
                     Specifies an asset measurement  property.  A  measurement
                     represents  a  device's  raw  sensor data stream, such as
                     timestamped temperature values or timestamped power  val-
                     ues.

                     processingConfig -> (structure)
                        The processing configuration for the given measurement
                        property. You can configure measurements to be kept at
                        the  edge  or  forwarded  to  the  Amazon Web Services
                        Cloud. By default, measurements are forwarded  to  the
                        cloud.

                        forwardingConfig -> (structure)

                               The forwarding state for the given property.

                 transform -> (structure)
                     Specifies an asset transform property. A  transform  con-
                     tains  a  mathematical  expression that maps a property's
                     data points from one form to another, such as a unit con-
                     version from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

                     expression -> (string)
                        The mathematical expression that defines the transfor-
                        mation function. You can specify up  to  10  variables
                        per expression. You can specify up to 10 functions per
                        expression.

                        For more information, see Quotas in the  IoT  SiteWise

                               The friendly name of the variable to be used in
                               the expression.

                            value -> (structure)
                               The variable that identifies an asset  property
                               from which to use values.

                               propertyId -> (string)
                                   The  ID of the property to use as the vari-
                                   able. You can use the property name if it's
                                   from  the same asset model. If the property
                                   has an external ID, you can specify  exter-
                                   nalId:  followed  by  the  external ID. For
                                   more information, see Using external IDs in
                                   the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                               hierarchyId -> (string)
                                   The  ID  of  the hierarchy to query for the
                                   property ID. You can  use  the  hierarchy's
                                   name  instead of the hierarchy's ID. If the
                                   hierarchy has an external ID, you can spec-
                                   ify  externalId:  followed  by the external
                                   ID. For more information, see Using  exter-
                                   nal IDs in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                                   You  use  a hierarchy ID instead of a model
                                   ID because you can have several hierarchies
                                   using the same model and therefore the same
                                   propertyId . For example,  you  might  have
                                   separately  grouped  assets  that come from
                                   the same asset model. For more information,
                                   see  Asset  hierarchies in the IoT SiteWise

                     process all input data points over a  time  interval  and
                     output  a single data point, such as to calculate the av-
                     erage hourly temperature.

                     expression -> (string)
                        The mathematical expression that  defines  the  metric
                        aggregation  function.  You can specify up to 10 vari-
                        ables per expression. You can specify up to  10  func-
                        tions per expression.

                                   able. You can use the property name if it's
                                   from the same asset model. If the  property
                                   has  an external ID, you can specify exter-
                                   nalId: followed by  the  external  ID.  For

                                   ID.  For more information, see Using exter-
                                   nal IDs in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                                   You use a hierarchy ID instead of  a  model
                                   ID because you can have several hierarchies
                                   using the same model and therefore the same

                               week.

                               IoT SiteWise computes the 1w interval  the  end
                               of  Sunday  at midnight each week (UTC), the 1d
                               interval at the end of  each  day  at  midnight
                               (UTC), the 1h interval at the end of each hour,
                               and so on.

                               When IoT SiteWise aggregates  data  points  for
                               metric computations, the start of each interval
                               is exclusive and the end of  each  interval  is
                               inclusive.  IoT  SiteWise  places  the computed
                               data point at the end of the interval.

                            offset -> (string)
                               The offset for the tumbling window. The  offset
                               parameter accepts the following:

                               o The  offset time. For example, if you specify
                                 18h for offset and  1d  for  interval  ,  IoT
                                 SiteWise  aggregates  data in one of the fol-
                                 lowing ways:

                                 o If you create the metric before or at 6  PM
                                   (UTC), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at 6 PM (UTC) on the day  when  you  create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If  you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC),
                                   you get the first aggregation result  at  6
                                   PM (UTC) the next day.

                               o The  ISO  8601  format.  For  example, if you
                                 specify PT18H for offset and 1d for  interval
                                 ,  IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the
                                 following ways:

                                 o If you create the metric before or at 6  PM
                                   (UTC), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at 6 PM (UTC) on the day  when  you  create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If  you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC),
                                   you get the first aggregation result  at  6
                                   PM (UTC) the next day.

                               o The  24-hour clock. For example, if you spec-
                                 ify 00:03:00 for offset , 5m for  interval  ,
                                 and  you create the metric at 2 PM (UTC), you
                                 get the first aggregation result at  2:03  PM
                                 (UTC).  You get the second aggregation result
                                 at 2:08 PM (UTC).

                               o The offset time zone.  For  example,  if  you
                                 specify 2021-07-23T18:00-08 for offset and 1d
                                 for interval , IoT SiteWise  aggregates  data
                                 in one of the following ways:

                                 o If  you create the metric before or at 6 PM
                                   (PST), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at  6  PM  (PST) on the day when you create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If you create the metric after 6 PM  (PST),
                                   you  get  the first aggregation result at 6
                                   PM (PST) the next day.

                     processingConfig -> (structure)
                        The processing  configuration  for  the  given  metric
                        property.  You can configure metrics to be computed at
                        the edge or in the Amazon Web Services Cloud.  By  de-
                        fault, metrics are forwarded to the cloud.

                        computeLocation -> (string)
                            The  compute  location  for the given metric prop-
                            erty.

              path -> (list)
                 The structured path to the property from the root of the  as-
                 set model.

                 (structure)
                     Represents  one  level between a property and the root of
                     the asset model.

                     id -> (string)
                        The ID of the path segment.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the path segment.

              externalId -> (string)
                 The external ID (if any) provided in the CreateAssetModel  or
                 UpdateAssetModel  operation. You can assign an external ID by
                 specifying this value as part of a call to UpdateAssetModel .
                 However,  you  can't change the external ID if one is already
                 assigned. For more information, see Using external IDs in the
                 IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       --asset-model-hierarchies (list)
          The updated hierarchy definitions of the asset model. Each hierarchy
          specifies an asset model whose assets can be children of  any  other
          assets  created  from  this  asset  model. For more information, see
          Asset hierarchies in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

          You can specify up to 10 hierarchies per asset model. For  more  in-
          formation, see Quotas in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

          (structure)
              Describes  an  asset hierarchy that contains a hierarchy's name,
              ID, and child asset model ID that specifies the  type  of  asset
              that can be in this hierarchy.

              id -> (string)
                 The ID of the asset model hierarchy. This ID is a hierarchyId
                 .

                 o If you are callling UpdateAssetModel to create a new  hier-
                   archy:  You  can specify its ID here, if desired. IoT Site-
                   Wise automatically generates a unique ID for you,  so  this
                   parameter is never required. However, if you prefer to sup-
                   ply your own ID instead, you can specify it  here  in  UUID
                   format.  If  you  specify  your own ID, it must be globally
                   unique.

                 o If you are calling UpdateAssetModel to modify  an  existing
                   hierarchy: This can be either the actual ID in UUID format,
                   or else externalId: followed by the external ID, if it  has
                   one. For more information, see Referencing objects with ex-
                   ternal IDs in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the asset model hierarchy that you specify by us-
                 ing the CreateAssetModel or UpdateAssetModel API operation.

              childAssetModelId -> (string)
                 The ID of the asset model, in UUID format. All assets in this
                 hierarchy must be instances of  the  childAssetModelId  asset
                 model. IoT SiteWise will always return the actual asset model
                 ID for this value. However,  when  you  are  specifying  this
                 value as part of a call to UpdateAssetModel , you may provide
                 either the asset model ID or else externalId: followed by the
                 asset  model's  external  ID. For more information, see Using
                 external IDs in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

              externalId -> (string)
                 The external ID (if any) provided in the CreateAssetModel  or
                 UpdateAssetModel  operation. You can assign an external ID by
                 specifying this value as part of a call to UpdateAssetModel .
                 However,  you  can't change the external ID if one is already
                 assigned. For more information, see Using external IDs in the
                 IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       --asset-model-composite-models (list)
          The  composite  models  that are part of this asset model. It groups
          properties (such as attributes, measurements, transforms,  and  met-
          rics) and child composite models that model parts of your industrial
          equipment. Each composite model has a type that defines the  proper-
          ties  that the composite model supports. Use composite models to de-
          fine alarms on this asset model.

          NOTE:
              When  creating  custom  composite  models,  you  need   to   use
              CreateAssetModelCompositeModel   .  For  more  information,  see
              Creating custom composite models (Components) in the  IoT  Site-
              Wise User Guide .

          (structure)
              Contains  information about a composite model in an asset model.
              This object contains the asset property definitions that you de-
              fine in the composite model.

                 The name of the composite model.

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the composite model.

              type -> (string)
                 The  type of the composite model. For alarm composite models,
                 this type is AWS/ALARM .

              properties -> (list)
                 The asset property definitions for this composite model.

                 (structure)
                     Contains information about an asset model property.

                     id -> (string)
                        The ID of the asset model property.

                        o If you are callling UpdateAssetModel to create a new
                          property:  You  can specify its ID here, if desired.
                          IoT SiteWise automatically generates a unique ID for
                          you,  so  this parameter is never required. However,

                          specify  it here in UUID format. If you specify your
                          own ID, it must be globally unique.

                        o If you are calling UpdateAssetModel to modify an ex-
                          isting property: This can be either the actual ID in
                          UUID format, or else externalId: followed by the ex-
                          ternal  ID, if it has one. For more information, see

                               The default value of the asset  model  property
                               attribute.  All assets that you create from the
                               asset model contain this attribute  value.  You
                               can  update an attribute's value after you cre-
                               ate  an  asset.  For  more   information,   see

                                          model and therefore the same proper-
                                          tyId . For example, you  might  have
                                          separately  grouped assets that come
                                          from the same asset model. For  more

                                   interval -> (string)
                                      The  time interval for the tumbling win-
                                      dow. The interval time must be between 1
                                      minute and 1 week.

                                      IoT  SiteWise  computes  the 1w interval
                                      the end of Sunday at midnight each  week
                                      (UTC),  the  1d  interval  at the end of
                                      each day at midnight (UTC), the  1h  in-
                                      terval  at  the end of each hour, and so
                                      on.

                                      When IoT SiteWise aggregates data points
                                      for  metric  computations,  the start of
                                      each interval is exclusive and  the  end
                                      of each interval is inclusive. IoT Site-
                                      Wise places the computed data  point  at
                                      the end of the interval.

                                   offset -> (string)
                                      The  offset for the tumbling window. The
                                      offset parameter accepts the following:

                                      o The offset time. For example,  if  you
                                        specify  18h for offset and 1d for in-
                                        terval , IoT SiteWise aggregates  data
                                        in one of the following ways:

                                        o If  you  create the metric before or
                                          at 6 PM (UTC), you get the first ag-
                                          gregation  result  at  6 PM (UTC) on
                                          the day when you create the metric.

                                        o If you create the metric after 6  PM
                                          (UTC), you get the first aggregation
                                          result at 6 PM (UTC) the next day.

                                      o The ISO 8601 format. For  example,  if
                                        you  specify  PT18H  for offset and 1d
                                        for interval , IoT SiteWise aggregates
                                        data in one of the following ways:

                                        o If  you  create the metric before or

                                          the day when you create the metric.

                                        o If you create the metric after 6  PM
                                          (UTC), you get the first aggregation
                                          result at 6 PM (UTC) the next day.

                                      o The 24-hour clock. For example, if you
                                        specify  00:03:00  for offset , 5m for
                                        interval , and you create  the  metric
                                        at  2  PM (UTC), you get the first ag-
                                        gregation result at 2:03 PM (UTC). You
                                        get  the  second aggregation result at
                                        2:08 PM (UTC).

                                      o The offset time zone. For example,  if
                                        you  specify  2021-07-23T18:00-08  for
                                        offset and 1d for interval , IoT Site-
                                        Wise  aggregates  data  in  one of the
                                        following ways:

                                        o If you create the metric  before  or
                                          at 6 PM (PST), you get the first ag-

       --client-token (string)
          A unique case-sensitive identifier that you can  provide  to  ensure
          the  idempotency  of the request. Don't reuse this client token if a
          new idempotent request is required.

       --asset-model-external-id (string)
          An external ID to assign to the asset model. The  asset  model  must
          not  already  have  an  external  ID. The external ID must be unique
          within your Amazon Web Services account. For more  information,  see
          Using external IDs in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       To update an asset model

       The  following  update-asset-model  example  updates  a wind farm asset
       model's description. This example includes the model's existing IDs and
       definitions,  because  update-asset-model overwrites the existing model
       with the new model.
