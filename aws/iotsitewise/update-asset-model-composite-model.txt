NAME
       update-asset-model-composite-model -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  a composite model and all of the assets that were created from
       the model. Each asset created from the model inherits the updated asset
       model's  property  and hierarchy definitions. For more information, see
       Updating assets and models in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       WARNING:
          If you remove a property from a composite asset model, IoT  SiteWise
          deletes  all  previous  data  for that property. You cant change the
          type or data type of an existing property.

          To replace an existing composite asset model property with a new one
          with the same name , do the following:

          o Submit  an  UpdateAssetModelCompositeModel request with the entire
            existing property removed.

          o Submit a second UpdateAssetModelCompositeModel  request  that  in-
            cludes the new property. The new asset property will have the same
            name as the previous one and IoT  SiteWise  will  generate  a  new
            unique id .

OPTIONS
       --asset-model-id (string)
          The ID of the asset model, in UUID format.

       --asset-model-composite-model-id (string)
          The ID of a composite model on this asset model.

       --asset-model-composite-model-external-id (string)
          An  external  ID  to assign to the asset model. You can only set the
          external ID of the asset model if it wasn't set when it was created,
          or you're setting it to the exact same thing as when it was created.

       --asset-model-composite-model-description (string)
          A description for the composite model.

       --asset-model-composite-model-name (string)
          A unique name for the composite model.

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique  case-sensitive  identifier that you can provide to ensure
          the idempotency of the request. Don't reuse this client token  if  a
          new idempotent request is required.

       --asset-model-composite-model-properties (list)
          The  property  definitions of the composite model. For more informa-
          tion, see Inline custom composite models in the  IoT  SiteWise  User
          Guide .

          You  can  specify up to 200 properties per composite model. For more
          information, see Quotas in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

          (structure)
              Contains information about an asset model property.

              id -> (string)
                 The ID of the asset model property.

                 o If you are callling UpdateAssetModel to create a new  prop-
                   erty: You can specify its ID here, if desired. IoT SiteWise
                   automatically generates a unique ID for you, so this param-
                   eter  is  never  required. However, if you prefer to supply
                   your own ID instead, you can specify it here in  UUID  for-
                   mat.  If  you  specify  your  own  ID,  it must be globally
                   unique.

                 o If you are calling UpdateAssetModel to modify  an  existing
                   property:  This can be either the actual ID in UUID format,
                   or else externalId: followed by the external ID, if it  has
                   one. For more information, see Referencing objects with ex-
                   ternal IDs in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

              externalId -> (string)
                 The external ID (if any) provided in the CreateAssetModel  or
                 UpdateAssetModel  operation. You can assign an external ID by
                 specifying this value as part of a call to UpdateAssetModel .
                 However,  you  can't change the external ID if one is already
                 assigned. For more information, see Using external IDs in the
                 IoT SiteWise User Guide .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the asset model property.

              dataType -> (string)
                 The data type of the asset model property.

              dataTypeSpec -> (string)
                 The data type of the structure for this property. This param-
                 eter exists on properties that have the STRUCT data type.

              unit -> (string)
                 The unit of the asset model property, such as Newtons or  RPM
                 .

              type -> (structure)
                 The property type (see PropertyType ).

                 attribute -> (structure)
                     Specifies  an asset attribute property. An attribute gen-
                     erally contains static information, such  as  the  serial
                     number of an IIoT wind turbine.

                     defaultValue -> (string)
                        The  default  value of the asset model property attri-
                        bute. All assets that you create from the asset  model
                        contain this attribute value. You can update an attri-
                        bute's value after you create an asset. For  more  in-
                        formation,  see  Updating  attribute values in the IoT
                        SiteWise User Guide .

                 measurement -> (structure)
                     Specifies an asset measurement  property.  A  measurement
                     represents  a  device's  raw  sensor data stream, such as
                     timestamped temperature values or timestamped power  val-
                     ues.

                     processingConfig -> (structure)
                        The processing configuration for the given measurement
                        property. You can configure measurements to be kept at
                        the  edge  or  forwarded  to  the  Amazon Web Services
                        Cloud. By default, measurements are forwarded  to  the

                            surement property.

                            state -> (string)
                               The forwarding state for the given property.

                 transform -> (structure)
                     Specifies an asset transform property. A  transform  con-
                     tains  a  mathematical  expression that maps a property's
                     data points from one form to another, such as a unit con-
                     version from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

                     expression -> (string)
                        The mathematical expression that defines the transfor-
                        mation function. You can specify up  to  10  variables
                        per expression. You can specify up to 10 functions per
                        expression.

                        For more information, see Quotas in the  IoT  SiteWise
                        User Guide .

                               The friendly name of the variable to be used in
                               the expression.

                            value -> (structure)
                               The variable that identifies an asset  property
                               from which to use values.

                               propertyId -> (string)
                                   The  ID of the property to use as the vari-
                                   able. You can use the property name if it's
                                   from  the same asset model. If the property
                                   has an external ID, you can specify  exter-
                                   nalId:  followed  by  the  external ID. For
                                   more information, see Using external IDs in
                                   the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                               hierarchyId -> (string)
                                   The  ID  of  the hierarchy to query for the
                                   property ID. You can  use  the  hierarchy's
                                   name  instead of the hierarchy's ID. If the
                                   hierarchy has an external ID, you can spec-
                                   ify  externalId:  followed  by the external
                                   ID. For more information, see Using  exter-
                                   nal IDs in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                                   You  use  a hierarchy ID instead of a model
                                   ID because you can have several hierarchies
                                   using the same model and therefore the same
                                   propertyId . For example,  you  might  have
                                   separately  grouped  assets  that come from
                                   the same asset model. For more information,
                                   see  Asset  hierarchies in the IoT SiteWise

                 metric -> (structure)
                     Specifies an asset metric property. A metric  contains  a
                     mathematical  expression that uses aggregate functions to
                     process all input data points over a  time  interval  and
                     output  a single data point, such as to calculate the av-
                     erage hourly temperature.

                     expression -> (string)
                        The mathematical expression that  defines  the  metric
                        aggregation  function.  You can specify up to 10 vari-
                        ables per expression. You can specify up to  10  func-
                        tions per expression.

                               from which to use values.

                               propertyId -> (string)
                                   The ID of the property to use as the  vari-
                                   able. You can use the property name if it's
                                   from the same asset model. If the  property
                                   has  an external ID, you can specify exter-
                                   nalId: followed by  the  external  ID.  For
                                   more information, see Using external IDs in
                                   the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                               hierarchyId -> (string)
                                   The ID of the hierarchy to  query  for  the
                                   property  ID.  You  can use the hierarchy's
                                   name instead of the hierarchy's ID. If  the
                                   hierarchy has an external ID, you can spec-
                                   ify externalId: followed  by  the  external
                                   ID.  For more information, see Using exter-
                                   nal IDs in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                                   You use a hierarchy ID instead of  a  model
                                   ID because you can have several hierarchies
                                   using the same model and therefore the same
                                   propertyId  .  For  example, you might have
                                   separately grouped assets  that  come  from

                                          The ID of the path segment.

                                      name -> (string)
                                          The name of the path segment.

                     window -> (structure)
                        The window (time interval)  over  which  IoT  SiteWise
                        computes  the  metric's  aggregation  expression.  IoT
                        SiteWise computes one data point per window .

                        tumbling -> (structure)
                            The tumbling time interval window.

                            interval -> (string)
                               The time interval for the tumbling window.  The
                               interval  time  must  be between 1 minute and 1
                               week.

                               IoT SiteWise computes the 1w interval  the  end
                               of  Sunday  at midnight each week (UTC), the 1d
                               interval at the end of  each  day  at  midnight
                               (UTC), the 1h interval at the end of each hour,
                               and so on.

                               When IoT SiteWise aggregates  data  points  for
                               metric computations, the start of each interval
                               is exclusive and the end of  each  interval  is
                               inclusive.  IoT  SiteWise  places  the computed
                               data point at the end of the interval.

                            offset -> (string)
                               The offset for the tumbling window. The  offset
                               parameter accepts the following:

                               o The  offset time. For example, if you specify
                                 18h for offset and  1d  for  interval  ,  IoT
                                 SiteWise  aggregates  data in one of the fol-
                                 lowing ways:

                                 o If you create the metric before or at 6  PM
                                   (UTC), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at 6 PM (UTC) on the day  when  you  create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If  you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC),
                                   you get the first aggregation result  at  6
                                   PM (UTC) the next day.

                               o The  ISO  8601  format.  For  example, if you
                                 specify PT18H for offset and 1d for  interval
                                 ,  IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the
                                 following ways:

                                 o If you create the metric before or at 6  PM
                                   (UTC), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at 6 PM (UTC) on the day  when  you  create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If  you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC),
                                   you get the first aggregation result  at  6
                                   PM (UTC) the next day.

                               o The  24-hour clock. For example, if you spec-
                                 ify 00:03:00 for offset , 5m for  interval  ,
                                 and  you create the metric at 2 PM (UTC), you
                                 get the first aggregation result at  2:03  PM
                                 (UTC).  You get the second aggregation result
                                 at 2:08 PM (UTC).

                               o The offset time zone.  For  example,  if  you
                                 specify 2021-07-23T18:00-08 for offset and 1d
                                 for interval , IoT SiteWise  aggregates  data
                                 in one of the following ways:

                                 o If  you create the metric before or at 6 PM
                                   (PST), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at  6  PM  (PST) on the day when you create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If you create the metric after 6 PM  (PST),
                                   you  get  the first aggregation result at 6
                                   PM (PST) the next day.

                     processingConfig -> (structure)
                        The processing  configuration  for  the  given  metric
                        property.  You can configure metrics to be computed at
                        the edge or in the Amazon Web Services Cloud.  By  de-
                        fault, metrics are forwarded to the cloud.

                        computeLocation -> (string)
                            The  compute  location  for the given metric prop-
                            erty.

              path -> (list)
                 The structured path to the property from the root of the  as-
                 set model.

                 (structure)
                     Represents  one  level between a property and the root of
                     the asset model.

                     id -> (string)
                        The ID of the path segment.

                     name -> (string)

       --if-match (string)
          The expected current entity tag (ETag) for the asset  models  latest
          or active version (specified using matchForVersionType ). The update
          request is rejected if the tag does not match the latest  or  active
          version's current entity tag. See Optimistic locking for asset model
          writes in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       --if-none-match (string)
          Accepts * to reject the update request if an active version  (speci-
          fied  using  matchForVersionType  as ACTIVE ) already exists for the
          asset model.

       --match-for-version-type (string)
          Specifies the asset model version type (LATEST or ACTIVE )  used  in
          conjunction  with If-Match or If-None-Match headers to determine the
          target ETag for the update operation.

          Possible values:

          o LATEST

          o ACTIVE

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
