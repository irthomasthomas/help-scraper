OPTIONS
       --asset-model-id (string)
          The  ID of the asset model. This can be either the actual ID in UUID
          format, or else externalId: followed by the external ID, if  it  has
          one. For more information, see Referencing objects with external IDs
          in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       --asset-model-composite-model-id (string)
          The ID of a composite model on this asset model. This can be  either
          the  actual  ID  in UUID format, or else externalId: followed by the
          external ID, if it has one. For more  information,  see  Referencing
          objects with external IDs in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       --asset-model-version (string)
          The version alias that specifies the latest or active version of the
          asset model. The details are returned in the response.  The  default
          value  is LATEST . See Asset model versions in the IoT SiteWise User
          Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

                 o If  you are callling UpdateAssetModel to create a new prop-
                   erty: You can specify its ID here, if desired. IoT SiteWise
                   automatically generates a unique ID for you, so this param-
                   eter is never required. However, if you  prefer  to  supply
                   your  own  ID instead, you can specify it here in UUID for-
                   mat. If you specify  your  own  ID,  it  must  be  globally
                   unique.

                 o If  you  are calling UpdateAssetModel to modify an existing
                   property: This can be either the actual ID in UUID  format,
                   or  else externalId: followed by the external ID, if it has
                   one. For more information, see Referencing objects with ex-
                   ternal IDs in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                 specifying this value as part of a call to UpdateAssetModel .
                 However, you can't change the external ID if one  is  already
                 assigned. For more information, see Using external IDs in the
                 IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                     erally  contains  static  information, such as the serial
                     number of an IIoT wind turbine.

                     defaultValue -> (string)
                        The default value of the asset model  property  attri-
                        bute.  All assets that you create from the asset model
                        contain this attribute value. You can update an attri-
                        bute's  value  after you create an asset. For more in-
                        formation, see Updating attribute values  in  the  IoT
                        SiteWise User Guide .

                 measurement -> (structure)
                     Specifies  an  asset  measurement property. A measurement
                     represents a device's raw sensor  data  stream,  such  as
                     timestamped  temperature values or timestamped power val-
                     ues.

                     processingConfig -> (structure)
                        The processing configuration for the given measurement
                        property. You can configure measurements to be kept at
                        the edge or  forwarded  to  the  Amazon  Web  Services

                 transform -> (structure)
                     Specifies  an  asset transform property. A transform con-
                     tains a mathematical expression that  maps  a  property's
                     data points from one form to another, such as a unit con-
                     version from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

                     expression -> (string)
                        The mathematical expression that defines the transfor-
                        mation  function.  You  can specify up to 10 variables
                        per expression. You can specify up to 10 functions per
                        expression.

                            name -> (string)
                               The friendly name of the variable to be used in
                               the expression.

                            value -> (structure)
                               The  variable that identifies an asset property
                               from which to use values.

                               propertyId -> (string)
                                   The ID of the property to use as the  vari-
                                   able. You can use the property name if it's
                                   from the same asset model. If the  property
                                   has  an external ID, you can specify exter-
                                   nalId: followed by  the  external  ID.  For
                                   more information, see Using external IDs in
                                   the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                               hierarchyId -> (string)
                                   The ID of the hierarchy to  query  for  the
                                   property  ID.  You  can use the hierarchy's
                                   name instead of the hierarchy's ID. If  the
                                   hierarchy has an external ID, you can spec-
                                   ify externalId: followed  by  the  external
                                   ID.  For more information, see Using exter-
                                   nal IDs in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                                   You use a hierarchy ID instead of  a  model
                                   ID because you can have several hierarchies
                                   using the same model and therefore the same
                                   propertyId  .  For  example, you might have
                                   separately grouped assets  that  come  from
                                   the same asset model. For more information,
                                   see Asset hierarchies in the  IoT  SiteWise

                 metric -> (structure)
                     Specifies  an  asset metric property. A metric contains a
                     mathematical expression that uses aggregate functions  to
                     process  all  input  data points over a time interval and
                     output a single data point, such as to calculate the  av-
                     erage hourly temperature.

                     expression -> (string)
                        The  mathematical  expression  that defines the metric
                        aggregation function. You can specify up to  10  vari-
                        ables  per  expression. You can specify up to 10 func-
                        tions per expression.

                                   name  instead of the hierarchy's ID. If the
                                   hierarchy has an external ID, you can spec-
                                   ify  externalId:  followed  by the external
                                   ID. For more information, see Using  exter-
                                   nal IDs in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                                   You  use  a hierarchy ID instead of a model
                                   ID because you can have several hierarchies
                                   using the same model and therefore the same
                                   propertyId . For example,  you  might  have
                                   separately  grouped  assets  that come from
                                   the same asset model. For more information,
                                   see  Asset  hierarchies in the IoT SiteWise

                               propertyPath -> (list)
                                   The path of the property.

                                   (structure)
                                      Represents one level between a  property
                                      and the root of the asset model.

                                      id -> (string)
                                          The ID of the path segment.

                                      name -> (string)
                                          The name of the path segment.

                     window -> (structure)
                        The  window  (time  interval)  over which IoT SiteWise
                        computes  the  metric's  aggregation  expression.  IoT
                        SiteWise computes one data point per window .

                        tumbling -> (structure)
                            The tumbling time interval window.

                            interval -> (string)
                               The  time interval for the tumbling window. The
                               interval time must be between 1  minute  and  1
                               week.

                               IoT  SiteWise  computes the 1w interval the end
                               of Sunday at midnight each week (UTC),  the  1d
                               interval  at  the  end  of each day at midnight
                               (UTC), the 1h interval at the end of each hour,
                               and so on.

                               When  IoT  SiteWise  aggregates data points for
                               metric computations, the start of each interval
                               is  exclusive  and  the end of each interval is
                               inclusive. IoT  SiteWise  places  the  computed
                               data point at the end of the interval.

                            offset -> (string)
                               The  offset for the tumbling window. The offset
                               parameter accepts the following:

                               o The offset time. For example, if you  specify
                                 18h  for  offset  and  1d  for interval , IoT
                                 SiteWise aggregates data in one of  the  fol-
                                 lowing ways:

                                 o If  you create the metric before or at 6 PM
                                   (UTC), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at  6  PM  (UTC) on the day when you create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If you create the metric after 6 PM  (UTC),
                                   you  get  the first aggregation result at 6
                                   PM (UTC) the next day.

                               o The ISO 8601  format.  For  example,  if  you
                                 specify  PT18H for offset and 1d for interval
                                 , IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of  the
                                 following ways:

                                 o If  you create the metric before or at 6 PM
                                   (UTC), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at  6  PM  (UTC) on the day when you create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If you create the metric after 6 PM  (UTC),
                                   you  get  the first aggregation result at 6
                                   PM (UTC) the next day.

                               o The 24-hour clock. For example, if you  spec-
                                 ify  00:03:00  for offset , 5m for interval ,
                                 and you create the metric at 2 PM (UTC),  you
                                 get  the  first aggregation result at 2:03 PM
                                 (UTC). You get the second aggregation  result
                                 at 2:08 PM (UTC).

                               o The  offset  time  zone.  For example, if you
                                 specify 2021-07-23T18:00-08 for offset and 1d
                                 for  interval  , IoT SiteWise aggregates data
                                 in one of the following ways:

                                 o If you create the metric before or at 6  PM
                                   (PST), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at 6 PM (PST) on the day  when  you  create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If  you create the metric after 6 PM (PST),
                                   you get the first aggregation result  at  6
                                   PM (PST) the next day.
