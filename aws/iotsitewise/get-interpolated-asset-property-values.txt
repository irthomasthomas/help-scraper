NAME
       get-interpolated-asset-property-values -

DESCRIPTION
       Get  interpolated values for an asset property for a specified time in-
       terval, during a period of time. If your time series  is  missing  data
       points during the specified time interval, you can use interpolation to
       estimate the missing data.

       For example, you can use this operation to return the interpolated tem-
       perature  values for a wind turbine every 24 hours over a duration of 7
       days.

       To identify an asset property, you must specify one of the following:

       o The assetId and propertyId of an asset property.

       o A propertyAlias , which is a data stream alias  (for  example,  /com-
         pany/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature  ).  To  define  an asset prop-
         erty's alias, see UpdateAssetProperty .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-interpolated-asset-property-values is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  ar-
       gument.   When  using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: interpolatedAssetPropertyValues

OPTIONS
       --asset-id (string)
          The ID of the asset, in UUID format.

       --property-id (string)
          The ID of the asset property, in UUID format.

       --property-alias (string)
          The  alias  that  identifies  the property, such as an OPC-UA server
          data stream path (for example, /company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temper-
          ature  ).  For more information, see Mapping industrial data streams
          to asset properties in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       --start-time-in-seconds (long)
          The exclusive start of the range from which to interpolate data, ex-
          pressed in seconds in Unix epoch time.

       --start-time-offset-in-nanos (integer)
          The nanosecond offset converted from startTimeInSeconds .

       --end-time-in-seconds (long)
          The  inclusive  end of the range from which to interpolate data, ex-
          pressed in seconds in Unix epoch time.

       --end-time-offset-in-nanos (integer)
          The nanosecond offset converted from endTimeInSeconds .

       --quality (string)
          The quality of the asset property value. You can use this  parameter
          as  a  filter  to  choose only the asset property values that have a
          specific quality.

          Possible values:

          o GOOD

          o BAD

          o UNCERTAIN

       --interval-in-seconds (long)
          The time interval in seconds over which to  interpolate  data.  Each
          interval starts when the previous one ends.

       --type (string)
          The interpolation type.

          Valid values: LINEAR_INTERPOLATION | LOCF_INTERPOLATION

          o LINEAR_INTERPOLATION  Estimates missing data using linear interpo-
            lation . For example, you can use this operation to return the in-
            terpolated  temperature  values  for a wind turbine every 24 hours
            over a duration of 7 days. If the  interpolation  starts  July  1,
            2021,  at  9 AM, IoT SiteWise returns the first interpolated value
            on July 2, 2021, at 9 AM, the second interpolated value on July 3,
            2021, at 9 AM, and so on.

          o LOCF_INTERPOLATION   Estimates missing data using last observation
            carried forward interpolation If no data point is found for an in-
            terval,  IoT SiteWise returns the last observed data point for the
            previous interval and carries forward this interpolated value  un-
            til  a new data point is found. For example, you can get the state
            of an on-off valve every 24 hours over a duration of  7  days.  If
            the  interpolation  starts July 1, 2021, at 9 AM, IoT SiteWise re-
            turns the last observed data point between July 1, 2021, at  9  AM
            and  July  2,  2021, at 9 AM as the first interpolated value. If a
            data point isn't found after 9 AM on July 2,  2021,  IoT  SiteWise
            uses the same interpolated value for the rest of the days.

       --interval-window-in-seconds (long)
          The query interval for the window, in seconds. IoT SiteWise computes
          each interpolated value by using data points from the  timestamp  of
          each  interval,  minus  the window to the timestamp of each interval
          plus the window. If not specified, the  window  ranges  between  the
          start time minus the interval and the end time plus the interval.

          NOTE:

              o If you specify a value for the intervalWindowInSeconds parame-
                ter, the value for the type parameter must be  LINEAR_INTERPO-
                LATION .

              o If a data point isn't found during the specified query window,
                IoT SiteWise won't return an interpolated value for the inter-
                val.  This  indicates  that there's a gap in the ingested data
                points.

          For example, you can get the interpolated temperature values  for  a
          wind turbine every 24 hours over a duration of 7 days. If the inter-
          polation starts on July 1, 2021, at 9 AM with a window of  2  hours,
          IoT  SiteWise uses the data points from 7 AM (9 AM minus 2 hours) to
          11 AM (9 AM plus 2 hours) on July 2, 2021 to compute the  first  in-
          terpolated  value. Next, IoT SiteWise uses the data points from 7 AM
          (9 AM minus 2 hours) to 11 AM (9 AM plus 2 hours) on July 3, 2021 to
          compute the second interpolated value, and so on.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
