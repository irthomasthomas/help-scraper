SYNOPSIS
            batch-get-asset-property-aggregates
          --entries <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]

OPTIONS
       --entries (list)
          The  list  of asset property aggregate entries for the batch get re-
          quest. You can specify up to 16 entries per request.

          (structure)
              Contains information for an asset property aggregate entry  that
              is associated with the BatchGetAssetPropertyAggregates API.

              To  identify an asset property, you must specify one of the fol-
              lowing:

              o The assetId and propertyId of an asset property.

              o A propertyAlias , which is a data stream alias  (for  example,
                /company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature  ). To define an as-
                set property's alias, see UpdateAssetProperty .

              entryId -> (string)
                 The ID of the entry.

              assetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the asset in which the asset property was created.

              propertyId -> (string)
                 The ID of the asset property.

              propertyAlias -> (string)
                 The alias that identifies the property,  such  as  an  OPC-UA
                 server   data   stream   path  (for  example,  /company/wind-
                 farm/3/turbine/7/temperature ).  For  more  information,  see
                 Mapping  industrial  data  streams to asset properties in the
                 IoT SiteWise User Guide .

              aggregateTypes -> (list)
                 The data aggregating function.

                 (string)

              resolution -> (string)
                 The time interval over which to aggregate data.

              startDate -> (timestamp)
                 The exclusive start of the range from which to query histori-
                 cal data, expressed in seconds in Unix epoch time.

              endDate -> (timestamp)
                 The inclusive end of the range from which to query historical
                 data, expressed in seconds in Unix epoch time.

              qualities -> (list)
                 The quality by which to filter asset data.

                 (string)

              timeOrdering -> (string)
                 The chronological sorting order of the requested information.

                 Default: ASCENDING

       Shorthand Syntax:

          entryId=string,assetId=string,propertyId=string,propertyAlias=string,aggregateTypes=string,string,resolution=string,startDate=timestamp,endDate=timestamp,qualities=string,string,timeOrdering=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "entryId": "string",
              "assetId": "string",
              "propertyId": "string",
              "propertyAlias": "string",
              "aggregateTypes": ["AVERAGE"|"COUNT"|"MAXIMUM"|"MINIMUM"|"SUM"|"STANDARD_DEVIATION", ...],
              "resolution": "string",
              "startDate": timestamp,
              "endDate": timestamp,
              "qualities": ["GOOD"|"BAD"|"UNCERTAIN", ...],
              "timeOrdering": "ASCENDING"|"DESCENDING"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --next-token (string)
          The token to be used for the next set of paginated results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return for each paginated  request.
          A result set is returned in the two cases, whichever occurs first.

          o The size of the result set is less than 1 MB.

          o The number of data points in the result set is less than the value
            of maxResults . The maximum value of maxResults is 4000.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
