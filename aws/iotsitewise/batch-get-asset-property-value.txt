SYNOPSIS
            batch-get-asset-property-value
          --entries <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --entries (list)
          The list of asset property value entries for the batch get  request.
          You can specify up to 16 entries per request.

          (structure)
              Contains  information  for an asset property value entry that is
              associated with the BatchGetAssetPropertyValue API.

              To identify an asset property, you must specify one of the  fol-
              lowing:

              o The assetId and propertyId of an asset property.

              o A  propertyAlias  , which is a data stream alias (for example,
                /company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature ). To define an  as-
                set property's alias, see UpdateAssetProperty .

              entryId -> (string)
                 The ID of the entry.

              assetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the asset in which the asset property was created.

              propertyId -> (string)
                 The ID of the asset property.

              propertyAlias -> (string)
                 The  alias  that  identifies  the property, such as an OPC-UA
                 server  data  stream  path   (for   example,   /company/wind-
                 farm/3/turbine/7/temperature  ).  For  more  information, see
                 Mapping industrial data streams to asset  properties  in  the
                 IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          entryId=string,assetId=string,propertyId=string,propertyAlias=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "entryId": "string",
              "assetId": "string",
              "propertyId": "string",
              "propertyAlias": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --next-token (string)
          The token to be used for the next set of paginated results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
