CREATE-PORTAL()                                                CREATE-PORTAL()



NAME
       create-portal -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a portal, which can contain projects and dashboards. IoT Site-
       Wise Monitor uses IAM Identity Center or  IAM  to  authenticate  portal
       users and manage user permissions.

       NOTE:
          Before  you  can  sign in to a new portal, you must add at least one
          identity to that portal. For more information, see Adding or  remov-
          ing portal administrators in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

          A logo image to display in the portal. Upload a square, high-resolu-
          tion image. The image is displayed on a dark background.

          data -> (blob)
              The image file contents, represented as a base64-encoded string.
              The file size must be less than 1 MB.

          type -> (string)
              The file type of the image.

          User Guide .

       --portal-auth-mode (string)
          The service to use to authenticate users to the portal. Choose  from
          the following options:

          o SSO  The portal uses IAM Identity Center to authenticate users and
            manage user permissions. Before you can create a portal that  uses
            IAM Identity Center, you must enable IAM Identity Center. For more
            information, see Enabling IAM Identity Center in the IoT  SiteWise
            User  Guide . This option is only available in Amazon Web Services
            Regions other than the China Regions.

          o IAM  The portal uses Identity and Access Management  to  authenti-
            cate users and manage user permissions.

          You can't change this value after you create a portal.

          Default: SSO

          Possible values:

          o IAM

          o SSO

       --notification-sender-email (string)
          The email address that sends alarm notifications.

          WARNING:
              If you use the IoT Events managed Lambda function to manage your
              emails, you must verify the sender email address in Amazon SES .

       --alarms (structure)
          Contains the configuration information of an alarm created in an IoT
          SiteWise  Monitor  portal. You can use the alarm to monitor an asset
          property and get notified when the asset property value is outside a
          specified range. For more information, see Monitoring with alarms in
          the IoT SiteWise Application Guide .

          alarmRoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the IAM role that allows the alarm to perform actions
              and  access  Amazon Web Services resources and services, such as
              IoT Events.

          notificationLambdaArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the Lambda function that manages alarm notifications.
              For  more  information,  see Managing alarm notifications in the
              IoT Events Developer Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          alarmRoleArn=string,notificationLambdaArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "alarmRoleArn": "string",

          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a portal

       The following create-portal example creates a web  portal  for  a  wind
       farm  company. You can create portals only in the same Region where you
       enabled AWS Single Sign-On.

          aws iotsitewise create-portal \
              --portal-name WindFarmPortal \
              --portal-description "A portal that contains wind farm projects for Example Corp." \
              --portal-contact-email support@example.com \
              --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/MySiteWiseMonitorServiceRole

       Output:

          {
              "portalId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-aaaaaEXAMPLE",
              "portalArn": "arn:aws:iotsitewise:us-west-2:123456789012:portal/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-aaaaaEXAMPLE",
              "portalStartUrl": "https://a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-aaaaaEXAMPLE.app.iotsitewise.aws",
              "portalStatus": {
                  "state": "CREATING"
              },
              "ssoApplicationId": "ins-a1b2c3d4-EXAMPLE"
          }
