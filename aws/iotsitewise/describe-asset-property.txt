NAME
       describe-asset-property -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about an asset property.

       NOTE:
          When  you  call  this  operation for an attribute property, this re-
          sponse includes the default attribute value that you define  in  the
          asset  model. If you update the default value in the model, this op-
          eration's response includes the new default value.

       This operation doesn't return the value of the asset property.  To  get
       the value of an asset property, use GetAssetPropertyValue .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

SYNOPSIS

          --asset-id <value>
          --property-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]

          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --asset-id (string)
          The ID of the asset.

       --property-id (string)
          The ID of the asset property.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

          The name of the asset.

       assetModelId -> (string)
          The ID of the asset model.

       assetProperty -> (structure)
          The asset property's definition, alias, and notification state.

          This  response  includes this object for normal asset properties. If
          you describe an asset property in a composite model,  this  response
          includes the asset property information in compositeModel .

          id -> (string)
              The ID of the asset property.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the property.

          alias -> (string)
              The alias that identifies the property, such as an OPC-UA server
              data  stream   path   (for   example,   /company/windfarm/3/tur-
              bine/7/temperature  ).  For more information, see Mapping indus-
              trial data streams to asset properties in the IoT SiteWise  User
              Guide .

          notification -> (structure)
              The  asset property's notification topic and state. For more in-
              formation, see UpdateAssetProperty .

              topic -> (string)
                 The MQTT topic to which IoT SiteWise publishes property value
                 update notifications.

              state -> (string)
                 The current notification state.

          dataType -> (string)
              The property data type.

          unit -> (string)
              The unit (such as Newtons or RPM ) of the asset property.

          type -> (structure)
              The  property  type (see PropertyType ). A property contains one
              type.

              attribute -> (structure)
                 Specifies an asset attribute property. An attribute generally
                 contains  static information, such as the serial number of an
                 IIoT wind turbine.

                 defaultValue -> (string)
                     The default value of the asset model property  attribute.
                     All  assets  that you create from the asset model contain
                     this attribute value. You can update an attribute's value
                     after  you  create  an  asset.  For more information, see
                     Updating attribute values in the IoT SiteWise User  Guide
                     .

              measurement -> (structure)
                 Specifies an asset measurement property. A measurement repre-
                 sents a device's raw sensor data stream, such as  timestamped
                 temperature values or timestamped power values.

                 processingConfig -> (structure)
                     The  processing  configuration  for the given measurement
                     property. You can configure measurements to  be  kept  at
                     the  edge  or forwarded to the Amazon Web Services Cloud.
                     By default, measurements are forwarded to the cloud.

                     forwardingConfig -> (structure)
                        The forwarding configuration for the given measurement

                            The forwarding state for the given property.

              transform -> (structure)
                 Specifies an asset transform property. A transform contains a
                 mathematical expression that maps a  property's  data  points
                 from one form to another, such as a unit conversion from Cel-
                 sius to Fahrenheit.

                 expression -> (string)
                     The mathematical expression that defines the  transforma-
                     tion function. You can specify up to 10 variables per ex-
                     pression. You can specify up to 10 functions per  expres-
                     sion.

                     Guide .

                 variables -> (list)
                     The list of variables used in the expression.

                     (structure)
                        Contains expression variable information.

                        name -> (string)
                            The friendly name of the variable to  be  used  in
                            the expression.

                        value -> (structure)
                            The  variable  that  identifies  an asset property
                            from which to use values.

                            propertyId -> (string)
                               The ID of the property to use as the  variable.
                               You  can use the property name if it's from the
                               same asset model.

                            hierarchyId -> (string)
                               The ID of the hierarchy to query for the  prop-
                               erty  ID.  You can use the hierarchy's name in-
                               stead of the hierarchy's ID.

                               You use a hierarchy ID instead of  a  model  ID
                               because  you can have several hierarchies using
                               the same model and therefore the  same  proper-
                               tyId  .  For example, you might have separately
                               grouped assets that come from  the  same  asset
                               model.  For more information, see Asset hierar-
                               chies in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                 processingConfig -> (structure)
                     The processing  configuration  for  the  given  transform
                     property.  You can configure transforms to be kept at the
                     edge or forwarded to the Amazon Web Services  Cloud.  You
                     can  also configure transforms to be computed at the edge
                     or in the cloud.

                     computeLocation -> (string)
                        The compute location for the given transform property.

                     forwardingConfig -> (structure)
                        The forwarding configuration for a given property.

                        state -> (string)
                            The forwarding state for the given property.

              metric -> (structure)
                 Specifies an asset metric property. A metric contains a math-
                 ematical  expression that uses aggregate functions to process
                 all input data points over a time interval and output a  sin-
                 gle  data point, such as to calculate the average hourly tem-
                 perature.

                 expression -> (string)
                     The mathematical expression that defines the  metric  ag-
                     gregation  function.  You  can specify up to 10 variables
                     per expression. You can specify up to  10  functions  per
                     expression.

                     For more information, see Quotas in the IoT SiteWise User
                     Guide .

                 variables -> (list)
                     The list of variables used in the expression.

                     (structure)
                        Contains expression variable information.

                        name -> (string)
                            The friendly name of the variable to  be  used  in
                            the expression.

                        value -> (structure)
                            The  variable  that  identifies  an asset property
                            from which to use values.

                            propertyId -> (string)
                               The ID of the property to use as the  variable.
                               You  can use the property name if it's from the
                               same asset model.

                            hierarchyId -> (string)
                               The ID of the hierarchy to query for the  prop-
                               erty  ID.  You can use the hierarchy's name in-
                               stead of the hierarchy's ID.

                               You use a hierarchy ID instead of  a  model  ID
                               because  you can have several hierarchies using
                               the same model and therefore the  same  proper-
                               tyId  .  For example, you might have separately
                               grouped assets that come from  the  same  asset
                               model.  For more information, see Asset hierar-
                               chies in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                 window -> (structure)
                     The window (time interval) over which IoT  SiteWise  com-
                     putes  the  metric's aggregation expression. IoT SiteWise
                     computes one data point per window .

                     tumbling -> (structure)
                        The tumbling time interval window.

                        interval -> (string)
                            The time interval for the tumbling window. The in-
                            terval time must be between 1 minute and 1 week.

                            IoT  SiteWise  computes the 1w interval the end of
                            Sunday at midnight each week (UTC), the 1d  inter-
                            val  at the end of each day at midnight (UTC), the
                            1h interval at the end of each hour, and so on.

                            When IoT SiteWise aggregates data points for  met-
                            ric  computations,  the  start of each interval is
                            exclusive and the end of each interval  is  inclu-
                            sive.  IoT SiteWise places the computed data point
                            at the end of the interval.

                        offset -> (string)
                            The offset for the tumbling window. The offset pa-
                            rameter accepts the following:

                            o The offset time. For example, if you specify 18h
                              for offset and 1d for interval  ,  IoT  SiteWise
                              aggregates data in one of the following ways:

                              o If  you  create  the  metric before or at 6 PM
                                (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at
                                6 PM (UTC) on the day when you create the met-
                                ric.

                              o If you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC), you
                                get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC)
                                the next day.

                            o The ISO 8601 format. For example, if you specify
                              PT18H for offset and 1d for interval , IoT Site-
                              Wise aggregates data in  one  of  the  following
                              ways:

                              o If  you  create  the  metric before or at 6 PM
                                (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at
                                6 PM (UTC) on the day when you create the met-
                                ric.

                              o If you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC), you
                                get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC)
                                the next day.

                            o The 24-hour clock. For example, if  you  specify
                              00:03:00  for offset , 5m for interval , and you
                              create the metric at 2 PM  (UTC),  you  get  the
                              first  aggregation  result at 2:03 PM (UTC). You
                              get the second aggregation  result  at  2:08  PM
                              (UTC).

                            o The  offset time zone. For example, if you spec-
                              ify 2021-07-23T18:00-08 for offset  and  1d  for
                              interval  ,  IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one
                              of the following ways:

                              o If you create the metric before  or  at  6  PM
                                (PST), you get the first aggregation result at
                                6 PM (PST) on the day when you create the met-
                                ric.

                              o If you create the metric after 6 PM (PST), you
                                get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (PST)
                                the next day.

                                   able. You can use the property name if it's
                                   from the same asset model.

                               hierarchyId -> (string)
                                   The ID of the hierarchy to  query  for  the
                                   property  ID.  You  can use the hierarchy's
                                   name instead of the hierarchy's ID.

                                   You use a hierarchy ID instead of  a  model
                                   ID because you can have several hierarchies
                                   using the same model and therefore the same
                                   propertyId  .  For  example, you might have
                                   separately grouped assets  that  come  from
                                   the same asset model. For more information,

                     Specifies an asset metric property. A metric  contains  a
                     mathematical  expression that uses aggregate functions to
                     process all input data points over a  time  interval  and
                     output  a single data point, such as to calculate the av-
                     erage hourly temperature.

                     expression -> (string)
                        The mathematical expression that  defines  the  metric
                        aggregation  function.  You can specify up to 10 vari-
                        ables per expression. You can specify up to  10  func-
                        tions per expression.

                                   name instead of the hierarchy's ID.

                                   You use a hierarchy ID instead of  a  model
                                   ID because you can have several hierarchies
                                   using the same model and therefore the same
                                   propertyId  .  For  example, you might have
                                   separately grouped assets  that  come  from
                                   the same asset model. For more information,

                               The  time interval for the tumbling window. The
                               interval time must be between 1  minute  and  1
                               week.

                               IoT  SiteWise  computes the 1w interval the end
                               of Sunday at midnight each week (UTC),  the  1d
                               interval  at  the  end  of each day at midnight
                               (UTC), the 1h interval at the end of each hour,
                               and so on.

                               When  IoT  SiteWise  aggregates data points for
                               metric computations, the start of each interval
                               is  exclusive  and  the end of each interval is
                               inclusive. IoT  SiteWise  places  the  computed
                               data point at the end of the interval.

                               The  offset for the tumbling window. The offset
                               parameter accepts the following:

                               o The offset time. For example, if you  specify
                                 18h  for  offset  and  1d  for interval , IoT
                                 SiteWise aggregates data in one of  the  fol-
                                 lowing ways:

                                 o If  you create the metric before or at 6 PM
                                   (UTC), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at  6  PM  (UTC) on the day when you create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If you create the metric after 6 PM  (UTC),
                                   you  get  the first aggregation result at 6
                                   PM (UTC) the next day.

                               o The ISO 8601  format.  For  example,  if  you
                                 specify  PT18H for offset and 1d for interval
                                 , IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of  the
                                 following ways:

                                 o If  you create the metric before or at 6 PM
                                   (UTC), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at  6  PM  (UTC) on the day when you create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If you create the metric after 6 PM  (UTC),
                                   you  get  the first aggregation result at 6
                                   PM (UTC) the next day.

                               o The 24-hour clock. For example, if you  spec-
                                 ify  00:03:00  for offset , 5m for interval ,
                                 and you create the metric at 2 PM (UTC),  you
                                 get  the  first aggregation result at 2:03 PM
                                 (UTC). You get the second aggregation  result
                                 at 2:08 PM (UTC).

                               o The  offset  time  zone.  For example, if you
                                 specify 2021-07-23T18:00-08 for offset and 1d
                                 for  interval  , IoT SiteWise aggregates data
                                 in one of the following ways:

                                 o If you create the metric before or at 6  PM
                                   (PST), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at 6 PM (PST) on the day  when  you  create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If  you create the metric after 6 PM (PST),
                                   you get the first aggregation result  at  6
                                   PM (PST) the next day.

                     processingConfig -> (structure)
                        The  processing  configuration  for  the  given metric
                        property. You can configure metrics to be computed  at
                        the  edge  or in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. By de-
                        fault, metrics are forwarded to the cloud.

                        computeLocation -> (string)
                            The compute location for the  given  metric  prop-
                            erty.

          id -> (string)
              The ID of the composite model that contains the property.
