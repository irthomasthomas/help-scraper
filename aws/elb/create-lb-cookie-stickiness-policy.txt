CREATE-LB-COOKIE-STICKINESS-POLICY()      CREATE-LB-COOKIE-STICKINESS-POLICY()



NAME
       create-lb-cookie-stickiness-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  a stickiness policy with sticky session lifetimes controlled
       by the lifetime of the browser (user-agent) or a  specified  expiration
       period. This policy can be associated only with HTTP/HTTPS listeners.

       When  a  load balancer implements this policy, the load balancer uses a
       special cookie to track the instance for each request.  When  the  load
       balancer  receives  a request, it first checks to see if this cookie is
       present in the request. If so, the load balancer sends the  request  to
       the  application  server specified in the cookie. If not, the load bal-
       ancer sends the request to a server that is chosen based on the  exist-
       ing load-balancing algorithm.

       A  cookie is inserted into the response for binding subsequent requests
       from the same user to that server. The validity of the cookie is  based
       on the cookie expiration time, which is specified in the policy config-
       uration.

       For more information, see  Duration-Based  Session  Stickiness  in  the
       Classic Load Balancers Guide .

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-name (string)
          The name of the load balancer.

       --policy-name (string)
          The  name  of the policy being created. Policy names must consist of
          alphanumeric characters and dashes (-). This  name  must  be  unique
          within the set of policies for this load balancer.

       --cookie-expiration-period (long)
          The  time  period, in seconds, after which the cookie should be con-
          sidered stale. If you do not specify  this  parameter,  the  default
          value  is 0, which indicates that the sticky session should last for
          the duration of the browser session.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To generate a duration-based stickiness policy for your HTTPS load bal-
       ancer

       times controlled by the specified expiration period.

       Command:

          aws elb create-lb-cookie-stickiness-policy --load-balancer-name my-load-balancer --policy-name my-duration-cookie-policy --cookie-expiration-period 60

       None
