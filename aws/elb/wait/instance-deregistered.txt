NAME
       instance-deregistered -

DESCRIPTION
       Wait  until  JMESPath query InstanceStates[].State returns OutOfService
       for all elements when polling with  describe-instance-health.  It  will
       poll  every  15 seconds until a successful state has been reached. This
       will exit with a return code of 255 after 40 failed checks.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            instance-deregistered
          --load-balancer-name <value>
          [--instances <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-name (string)
          The name of the load balancer.

       --instances (list)
          The IDs of the instances.

          (structure)
              The ID of an EC2 instance.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The instance ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InstanceId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "InstanceId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To pause running until an instance is deregistered

       The following wait instance-deregistered command pauses  and  continues
       only after it can confirm that the specified instance is deregistered.

          aws elb wait instance-deregistered
                 --load-balancer-name   my-loadbalancer   --instances  Instan-
                 ceId=i-1234567890abcdef0

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
