CREATE-APP-COOKIE-STICKINESS-POLICY()    CREATE-APP-COOKIE-STICKINESS-POLICY()



NAME
       create-app-cookie-stickiness-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates a stickiness policy with sticky session lifetimes that follow
       that of an application-generated cookie. This policy can be  associated
       only with HTTP/HTTPS listeners.

       This  policy is similar to the policy created by  CreateLBCookieSticki-
       nessPolicy , except that the lifetime of the special Elastic Load  Bal-
       ancing  cookie, AWSELB , follows the lifetime of the application-gener-
       ated cookie specified in the policy configuration.  The  load  balancer
       only  inserts a new stickiness cookie when the application response in-
       cludes a new application cookie.

       If the application cookie is explicitly removed or expires, the session
       stops being sticky until a new application cookie is issued.

       For  more information, see Application-Controlled Session Stickiness in
       the Classic Load Balancers Guide .

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-name (string)
          The name of the load balancer.

       --policy-name (string)
          The name of the policy being created. Policy names must  consist  of
          alphanumeric  characters  and  dashes  (-). This name must be unique
          within the set of policies for this load balancer.

       --cookie-name (string)
          The name of the application cookie used for stickiness.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To generate a stickiness policy for your HTTPS load balancer

       This example generates a stickiness policy that follows the sticky ses-
       sion lifetimes of the application-generated cookie.

       Command:

          aws elb create-app-cookie-stickiness-policy --load-balancer-name my-load-balancer --policy-name my-app-cookie-policy --cookie-name my-app-cookie

OUTPUT
       None
