OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-name (string)
          The name of the load balancer.

       --health-check (structure)
          The configuration information.

          Target -> (string)
              The  instance  being  checked. The protocol is either TCP, HTTP,
              HTTPS, or SSL. The range of  valid  ports  is  one  (1)  through
              65535.

              TCP  is  the default, specified as a TCP: port pair, for example
              "TCP:5000". In this case, a health check simply attempts to open
              a  TCP connection to the instance on the specified port. Failure
              to connect within  the  configured  timeout  is  considered  un-
              healthy.

              SSL is also specified as SSL: port pair, for example, SSL:5000.

              For HTTP/HTTPS, you must include a ping path in the string. HTTP
              is specified as a HTTP:port;/;PathToPing; grouping, for  example
              "HTTP:80/weather/us/wa/seattle".  In  this  case, a HTTP GET re-
              quest is issued to the instance on the given port and path.  Any
              answer  other than "200 OK" within the timeout period is consid-
              ered unhealthy.

              The total length of the HTTP ping target  must  be  1024  16-bit
              Unicode characters or less.

          Interval -> (integer)
              The  approximate  interval, in seconds, between health checks of
              an individual instance.

          Timeout -> (integer)
              The amount of time, in seconds, during which no response means a
              failed health check.

              This value must be less than the Interval value.

          UnhealthyThreshold -> (integer)
              The  number of consecutive health check failures required before
              moving the instance to the Unhealthy state.

          HealthyThreshold -> (integer)
              The number of consecutive health checks successes  required  be-
              fore moving the instance to the Healthy state.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Target=string,Interval=integer,Timeout=integer,UnhealthyThreshold=integer,HealthyThreshold=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Target": "string",
            "Interval": integer,
            "Timeout": integer,
            "UnhealthyThreshold": integer,
            "HealthyThreshold": integer
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To specify the health check settings for your backend EC2 instances

       This example specifies the health check settings used to  evaluate  the
       health of your backend EC2 instances.

       Command:

          aws elb configure-health-check --load-balancer-name my-load-balancer --health-check Target=HTTP:80/png,Interval=30,UnhealthyThreshold=2,HealthyThreshold=2,Timeout=3

       Output:

          {
             "HealthCheck": {
                 "HealthyThreshold": 2,
                 "Interval": 30,
                 "Target": "HTTP:80/png",
                 "Timeout": 3,
                 "UnhealthyThreshold": 2
             }
          }

OUTPUT
       HealthCheck -> (structure)
          The updated health check.

          Target -> (string)

          Interval -> (integer)
              The  approximate  interval, in seconds, between health checks of
              an individual instance.

          Timeout -> (integer)
              The amount of time, in seconds, during which no response means a
