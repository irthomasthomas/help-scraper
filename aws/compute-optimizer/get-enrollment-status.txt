NAME
       get-enrollment-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the enrollment (opt in) status of an account to the Compute Op-
       timizer service.

       If the account is the management account of an organization,  this  ac-
       tion  also confirms the enrollment status of member accounts of the or-
       ganization. Use the  GetEnrollmentStatusesForOrganization action to get
       detailed  information about the enrollment status of member accounts of
       an organization.

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       status -> (string)
          The enrollment status of the account.

       statusReason -> (string)
          The reason for the enrollment status of the account.

          For example, an account might show a status of Pending because  mem-
          ber  accounts of an organization require more time to be enrolled in
          the service.

       memberAccountsEnrolled -> (boolean)
          Confirms the enrollment status of member accounts of  the  organiza-
          tion, if the account is a management account of an organization.

       lastUpdatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)

          status was last updated.

       numberOfMemberAccountsOptedIn -> (integer)
          The count of organization member accounts that are opted in  to  the
          service, if your account is an organization management account.
