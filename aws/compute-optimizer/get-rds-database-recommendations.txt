OPTIONS
       --resource-arns (list)
          The ARN that identifies the Amazon RDS.

          The following is the format of the ARN:
              arn:aws:rds:{region}:{accountId}:db:{resourceName}

          The following is the format of a DB Cluster ARN:
              arn:aws:rds:{region}:{accountId}:cluster:{resourceName}

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-token (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of Amazon RDS recommendations.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of Amazon RDS recommendations to return with a
          single request.

          To retrieve the remaining results, make another request with the re-
          turned nextToken value.

       --filters (list)
          An array of objects to specify a filter that returns a more specific
          list of Amazon RDS recommendations.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter that returns a more specific list  of  Amazon
              RDS recommendations. Use this filter with the  GetECSServiceRec-
              ommendations action.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 Specify Finding to return  recommendations  with  a  specific
                 finding classification.

                 You can filter your Amazon RDS recommendations by tag:key and
                 tag-key tags.

                 A tag:key is a key and value combination of a tag assigned to
                 your  Amazon RDS recommendations. Use the tag key in the fil-
                 ter name and the tag value as the filter value. For  example,
                 to  find  all  Amazon RDS service recommendations that have a
                 tag with the key of Owner and the value of  TeamA  ,  specify
                 tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

                 A  tag-key  is  the  key of a tag assigned to your Amazon RDS
                 recommendations. Use this filter to find all of  your  Amazon
                 RDS recommendations that have a tag with a specific key. This
                 doesnt consider the tag value. For example, you can find your
                 Amazon  RDS  service  recommendations with a tag key value of
                 Owner or without any tag keys assigned.

              values -> (list)
                 The value of the filter.

              o A  GetEC2InstanceRecommendations or  GetAutoScalingGroupRecom-
                mendations  request, Compute Optimizer returns recommendations
                that consist of Graviton instance types only.

              o A  GetEC2RecommendationProjectedMetrics request, Compute Opti-
                mizer  returns  projected utilization metrics for Graviton in-
                stance type recommendations only.

              o A   ExportEC2InstanceRecommendations  or    ExportAutoScaling-
                GroupRecommendations request, Compute Optimizer exports recom-
                mendations that consist of Graviton instance types only.

          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
