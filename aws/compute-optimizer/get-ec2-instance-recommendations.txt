OPTIONS
       --instance-arns (list)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instances for which to  return
          recommendations.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-token (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of instance recommendations.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of instance recommendations to return with a sin-
          gle request.

          To retrieve the remaining results, make another request with the re-
          turned nextToken value.

       --filters (list)
          An array of objects to specify a filter that returns a more specific
          list of instance recommendations.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter that returns a more specific list  of  recom-
              mendations.  Use this filter with the  GetAutoScalingGroupRecom-
              mendations and  GetEC2InstanceRecommendations actions.

              You can use EBSFilter with the  GetEBSVolumeRecommendations  ac-
              tion,  LambdaFunctionRecommendationFilter  with  the  GetLambda-
              FunctionRecommendations action,  and  JobFilter  with  the   De-
              scribeRecommendationExportJobs action.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 Specify  Finding  to  return  recommendations with a specific
                 finding classification (for example, Underprovisioned ).

                 Specify RecommendationSourceType to return recommendations of
                 a specific resource type (for example, Ec2Instance ).

                 Specify  FindingReasonCodes  to return recommendations with a
                 specific finding reason  code  (for  example,  CPUUnderprovi-
                 sioned ).

              values -> (list)
                 The value of the filter.

                 The valid values for this parameter are as follows, depending
                 on what you specify for the name parameter and  the  resource
                 type that you wish to filter results for:

                 o Specify  Optimized  or NotOptimized if you specify the name
                   parameter as Finding and you want  to  filter  results  for
                   Auto Scaling groups.

                 o Specify  Underprovisioned  , Overprovisioned , or Optimized
                   if you specify the name parameter as Finding and  you  want
                   to filter results for EC2 instances.

                 o Specify  Ec2Instance or AutoScalingGroup if you specify the
                   name parameter as RecommendationSourceType .

                 o Specify one of the following options  if  you  specify  the
                   name parameter as FindingReasonCodes :

       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the utilization metric.

                        The following utilization metrics are available:

                        o Cpu - The percentage of allocated EC2 compute  units
                          that are currently in use on the instance. This met-
                          ric identifies the processing power required to  run
                          an application on the instance. Depending on the in-
                          stance type, tools in your operating system can show
                          a lower percentage than CloudWatch when the instance
                          is not allocated a full processor core. Units:  Per-
                          cent

                        o Memory  - The percentage of memory that is currently
                          in use on the instance. This metric  identifies  the
                          amount  of  memory required to run an application on
                          the instance. Units: Percent

                        NOTE:
                            The Memory metric is returned only  for  resources

                     performanceRisk -> (double)
                        The performance risk of  the  instance  recommendation
                        option.

                        Performance  risk indicates the likelihood of the rec-
                        ommended instance type not meeting the resource  needs
                        of  your workload. Compute Optimizer calculates an in-
                        dividual performance risk score for each specification
                        of  the  recommended  instance, including CPU, memory,
                        EBS throughput, EBS IOPS, disk throughput, disk  IOPS,
                        network  throughput,  and network PPS. The performance
                        risk of the recommended instance is calculated as  the
                        maximum performance risk score across the analyzed re-
                        source specifications.

                        The value ranges from 0 - 4 , with 0 meaning that  the
                        recommended  resource  is  predicted to always provide
                        enough hardware capability. The higher the performance
                        risk  is,  the more likely you should validate whether
                        the recommendation will meet the performance  require-
                        ments of your workload before migrating your resource.

                     rank -> (integer)
                        The rank of the instance recommendation option.

                        The top recommendation option is ranked as 1 .

                            value -> (double)
                               The value of the estimated monthly savings.

                     migrationEffort -> (string)
                        The  level of effort required to migrate from the cur-
                        rent instance type to the recommended instance type.

                        For example, the migration effort is Low if Amazon EMR
                        is  the  inferred workload type and an Amazon Web Ser-
                        vices Graviton instance type is recommended.  The  mi-
                        gration  effort  is Medium if a workload type couldn't
                        be inferred but an Amazon Web  Services  Graviton  in-
                        stance  type  is  recommended. The migration effort is
                        VeryLow if both the current and  recommended  instance
                        types are of the same CPU architecture.

              recommendationSources -> (list)
                 An  array of objects that describe the source resource of the
                 recommendation.

                 (structure)

                        source.

                     recommendationSourceType -> (string)
                        The resource type of the recommendation source.

              lastRefreshTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp of when the instance  recommendation  was  last
                 generated.

              currentPerformanceRisk -> (string)
                 The  risk of the current instance not meeting the performance
                 needs of its workloads. The higher the risk, the more  likely
                 the current instance cannot meet the performance requirements
                 of its workload.

              effectiveRecommendationPreferences -> (structure)
