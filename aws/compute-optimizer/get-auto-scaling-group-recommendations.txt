OPTIONS
       --account-ids (list)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account for which to  return  Auto
          Scaling group recommendations.

          If  your  account  is the management account of an organization, use
          this parameter to specify the member account for which you  want  to
          return Auto Scaling group recommendations.

          Only one account ID can be specified per request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --auto-scaling-group-arns (list)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Auto Scaling groups for which
          to return recommendations.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-token (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of Auto Scaling  group  recom-
          mendations.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number of Auto Scaling group recommendations to return
          with a single request.

          To retrieve the remaining results, make another request with the re-
          turned nextToken value.

       --filters (list)
          An array of objects to specify a filter that returns a more specific
          list of Auto Scaling group recommendations.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter that returns a more specific list  of  recom-
              mendations.  Use this filter with the  GetAutoScalingGroupRecom-
              mendations and  GetEC2InstanceRecommendations actions.

              You can use EBSFilter with the  GetEBSVolumeRecommendations  ac-
              tion,  LambdaFunctionRecommendationFilter  with  the  GetLambda-
              FunctionRecommendations action,  and  JobFilter  with  the   De-
              scribeRecommendationExportJobs action.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 Specify  Finding  to  return  recommendations with a specific
                 finding classification (for example, Underprovisioned ).

                 Specify RecommendationSourceType to return recommendations of
                 a specific resource type (for example, Ec2Instance ).

                 Specify  FindingReasonCodes  to return recommendations with a
                 specific finding reason  code  (for  example,  CPUUnderprovi-
                 sioned ).

              values -> (list)
                 The value of the filter.

                 The valid values for this parameter are as follows, depending
                 on what you specify for the name parameter and  the  resource
                 type that you wish to filter results for:

                 o Specify  Optimized  or NotOptimized if you specify the name
                   parameter as Finding and you want  to  filter  results  for
                   Auto Scaling groups.

                 o Specify  Underprovisioned  , Overprovisioned , or Optimized
                   if you specify the name parameter as Finding and  you  want
                   to filter results for EC2 instances.

                 o Specify  Ec2Instance or AutoScalingGroup if you specify the
                   name parameter as RecommendationSourceType .

                 o Specify one of the following options  if  you  specify  the
                   name parameter as FindingReasonCodes :

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

              utilizationMetrics -> (list)
                 An  array of objects that describe the utilization metrics of
                 the Auto Scaling group.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a utilization metric of a resource, such as  an
                     Amazon EC2 instance.

                     Compare  the  utilization  metric  data  of your resource
                     against its projected utilization metric data  to  deter-
                     mine  the performance difference between your current re-
                     source and the recommended option.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the utilization metric.

                        The following utilization metrics are available:

                        o Cpu - The percentage of allocated EC2 compute  units
                          that are currently in use on the instance. This met-
                          ric identifies the processing power required to  run
                          an application on the instance. Depending on the in-
                          stance type, tools in your operating system can show
                          a lower percentage than CloudWatch when the instance
                          is not allocated a full processor core. Units:  Per-
                          cent

                        o Memory  - The percentage of memory that is currently
                          in use on the instance. This metric  identifies  the
                          amount  of  memory required to run an application on
                          the instance. Units: Percent

                        NOTE:
                            The Memory metric is returned only  for  resources
                            that  have  the unified CloudWatch agent installed
                            on them. For more information, see Enabling Memory
                            Utilization with the CloudWatch Agent .

                          period of time. Unit: Bytes

                        o EBS_WRITE_BYTES_PER_SECOND  -  The  bytes written to
                          all EBS volumes attached to the instance in a speci-
                          fied period of time. Unit: Bytes

                        o DISK_READ_OPS_PER_SECOND - The completed read opera-
                          tions from all instance store volumes  available  to

                          are no instance store volumes, either the value is 0
                          or the metric is not reported.

                        o DISK_WRITE_OPS_PER_SECOND  - The completed write op-
                          erations from all instance store  volumes  available
                          to  the  instance  in a specified period of time. If

                          instance store volumes available  to  the  instance.
                          This  metric  is used to determine the volume of the
                          data the application reads from the disk of the  in-
                          stance.  This  can be used to determine the speed of
                          the application. If there are no instance store vol-
                          umes, either the value is 0 or the metric is not re-
                          ported.

                          of  the data the application writes onto the disk of
                          the instance. This can  be  used  to  determine  the
                          speed  of  the application. If there are no instance
                          store volumes, either the value is 0 or  the  metric
                          is not reported.

                        o NETWORK_IN_BYTES_PER_SECOND  -  The  number of bytes
                          received by the instance on all network  interfaces.
                          This  metric  identifies the volume of incoming net-
                          work traffic to a single instance.

                        o NETWORK_OUT_BYTES_PER_SECOND - The number  of  bytes
                          sent  out by the instance on all network interfaces.
                          This metric identifies the volume of  outgoing  net-
                          work traffic from a single instance.

                        o NETWORK_PACKETS_IN_PER_SECOND  - The number of pack-
                          ets received by the instance on all  network  inter-
                          faces. This metric identifies the volume of incoming
                          traffic in terms of the number of packets on a  sin-
                          gle instance.

                        o NETWORK_PACKETS_OUT_PER_SECOND - The number of pack-
                          ets sent out by the instance on all  network  inter-
                          faces. This metric identifies the volume of outgoing
                          traffic in terms of the number of packets on a  sin-

                        The  Compute  Optimizer  API,  Command  Line Interface
                        (CLI), and SDKs return utilization metrics using  only
                        the  Maximum statistic, which is the highest value ob-
                        served during the specified period.

                        The Compute Optimizer console displays graphs for some
                        utilization metrics using the Average statistic, which
                        is the value of Sum / SampleCount during the specified
                        period.  For  more  information,  see Viewing resource
                        recommendations in the Compute Optimizer User Guide  .

                                 tools in your operating  system  can  show  a
                                 lower percentage than CloudWatch when the in-
                                 stance is  not  allocated  a  full  processor

                                 reads from the disk of the instance. This can
                                 be  used to determine the speed of the appli-
                                 cation. If there are no instance  store  vol-
                                 umes,  either the value is 0 or the metric is
                                 not reported.

                               o DISK_WRITE_BYTES_PER_SECOND - The bytes writ-
                                 ten  to  all instance store volumes available
                                 to the instance. This metric is used  to  de-
                                 termine  the  volume of the data the applica-
                                 tion writes onto the disk  of  the  instance.
                                 This  can  be  used to determine the speed of
                                 the application. If  there  are  no  instance
                                 store  volumes,  either the value is 0 or the
                                 metric is not reported.

                               o NETWORK_IN_BYTES_PER_SECOND - The  number  of
                                 bytes received by the instance on all network
                                 interfaces. This metric identifies the volume
                                 of  incoming  network traffic to a single in-
                                 stance.

                               o NETWORK_OUT_BYTES_PER_SECOND - The number  of
                                 bytes sent out by the instance on all network
                                 interfaces. This metric identifies the volume
                                 of outgoing network traffic from a single in-
                                 stance.

                               o NETWORK_PACKETS_IN_PER_SECOND - The number of
                                 packets  received by the instance on all net-
                                 work interfaces. This metric  identifies  the
                                 volume  of  incoming  traffic in terms of the
                                 number of packets on a single instance.

                               o NETWORK_PACKETS_OUT_PER_SECOND -  The  number
                                 of  packets  sent  out by the instance on all
                                 network interfaces.  This  metric  identifies
                                 the  volume  of  outgoing traffic in terms of
                                 the number of packets on a single instance.

                            statistic -> (string)
                               The statistic of the utilization metric.

                               The Compute Optimizer API, Command Line  Inter-
                               face (CLI), and SDKs return utilization metrics
                               using only the Maximum statistic, which is  the
                               highest value observed during the specified pe-
                               riod.

                               The Compute Optimizer console  displays  graphs
                               for  some utilization metrics using the Average
                               statistic, which is the value of Sum /  Sample-
                               Count during the specified period. For more in-
                               formation, see Viewing resource recommendations
                               in  the  Compute Optimizer User Guide . You can
                               also get averaged utilization metric  data  for
                               your  resources  using  Amazon  CloudWatch. For
                               more information,  see  the  Amazon  CloudWatch
                               User Guide .

                            value -> (double)
                               The value of the utilization metric.

                     performanceRisk -> (double)
                        The performance risk of the Auto Scaling group config-
                        uration recommendation.

                        Performance risk indicates the likelihood of the  rec-
                        ommended  instance type not meeting the resource needs
                        of your workload. Compute Optimizer calculates an  in-
                        dividual performance risk score for each specification
                        of the recommended instance,  including  CPU,  memory,
                        EBS  throughput, EBS IOPS, disk throughput, disk IOPS,
                        network throughput, and network PPS.  The  performance
                        risk  of the recommended instance is calculated as the
                        maximum performance risk score across the analyzed re-
                        source specifications.

                        The  value ranges from 0 - 4 , with 0 meaning that the
                        recommended resource is predicted  to  always  provide
                        enough hardware capability. The higher the performance
                        risk is, the more likely you should  validate  whether
                        the  recommendation will meet the performance require-
                        ments of your workload before migrating your resource.

                     rank -> (integer)
                        The rank of the Auto Scaling group recommendation  op-
                        tion.

                        The top recommendation option is ranked as 1 .

                     savingsOpportunity -> (structure)
                        An  object  that describes the savings opportunity for
                        the Auto Scaling group recommendation option.  Savings
                        opportunity  includes  the  estimated  monthly savings
                        amount and percentage.

                        savingsOpportunityPercentage -> (double)
                            The estimated monthly savings possible as  a  per-
                            centage  of monthly cost by adopting Compute Opti-
                            mizer recommendations for a given resource.

                        estimatedMonthlySavings -> (structure)
                            An object that  describes  the  estimated  monthly
                            savings  amount  possible,  based on On-Demand in-
                            stance pricing, by adopting Compute Optimizer rec-
                            ommendations for a given resource.

                            currency -> (string)
                               The currency of the estimated monthly savings.

                            value -> (double)
                               The value of the estimated monthly savings.

                     migrationEffort -> (string)
                        The  level of effort required to migrate from the cur-
                        rent instance type to the recommended instance type.

                        For example, the migration effort is Low if Amazon EMR
                        is  the  inferred workload type and an Amazon Web Ser-
                        vices Graviton instance type is recommended.  The  mi-
                        gration  effort  is Medium if a workload type couldn't
                        be inferred but an Amazon Web  Services  Graviton  in-
                        stance  type  is  recommended. The migration effort is
                        VeryLow if both the current and  recommended  instance
                        types are of the same CPU architecture.

              lastRefreshTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp  of when the Auto Scaling group recommendation
                 was last generated.

              currentPerformanceRisk -> (string)
                 The risk of the current Auto Scaling group  not  meeting  the
                 performance  needs of its workloads. The higher the risk, the
                 more likely the current Auto Scaling group configuration  has
                 insufficient capacity and cannot meet workload requirements.

              effectiveRecommendationPreferences -> (structure)
                 An object that describes the effective recommendation prefer-
                 ences for the Auto Scaling group.

                 cpuVendorArchitectures -> (list)
                     Describes the CPU vendor and architecture for an instance
                     or Auto Scaling group recommendations.

                     For example, when you specify AWS_ARM64 with:

                     o A   GetEC2InstanceRecommendations  or   GetAutoScaling-
                       GroupRecommendations request, Compute Optimizer returns
                       recommendations  that  consist  of  Graviton2  instance
                       types only.

                     o A  GetEC2RecommendationProjectedMetrics  request,  Com-
                       pute  Optimizer  returns  projected utilization metrics
                       for Graviton2 instance type recommendations only.

                     o A  ExportEC2InstanceRecommendations or  ExportAutoScal-
                       ingGroupRecommendations  request, Compute Optimizer ex-
                       ports recommendations that  consist  of  Graviton2  in-
                       stance types only.

                     (string)

                 enhancedInfrastructureMetrics -> (string)
                     Describes  the  activation  status of the enhanced infra-
                     structure metrics preference.

                     A status of Active confirms that the  preference  is  ap-
                     plied  in the latest recommendation refresh, and a status
                     of Inactive confirms that it's not yet applied to  recom-
                     mendations.

                     For more information, see Enhanced infrastructure metrics
                     in the Compute Optimizer User Guide .

                 inferredWorkloadTypes -> (string)
                     Describes the activation status of the inferred  workload
                     types preference.

                     A  status  of  Active confirms that the preference is ap-
                     plied in the latest recommendation refresh. A  status  of
                     Inactive  confirms that it's not yet applied to recommen-
                     dations.

                 externalMetricsPreference -> (structure)
                     An object that describes the external metrics recommenda-
                     tion preference.

                     If the preference is applied in the latest recommendation
                     refresh, an object with a valid source value  appears  in
                     the response. If the preference isn't applied to the rec-
                     ommendations already, then this object doesn't appear  in
                     the response.

                     source -> (string)
                        Contains the source options for external metrics pref-
                        erences.

              inferredWorkloadTypes -> (list)
                 The applications that might be running on  the  instances  in
                 the Auto Scaling group as inferred by Compute Optimizer.

                 Compute  Optimizer can infer if one of the following applica-
                 tions might be running on the instances:

                 o AmazonEmr - Infers that Amazon EMR might be running on  the
