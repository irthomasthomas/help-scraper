EXPORT-LAMBDA-FUNCTION-RECOMMENDATIONSEXPORT-LAMBDA-FUNCTION-RECOMMENDATIONS()



NAME
       export-lambda-function-recommendations -

DESCRIPTION
       Exports optimization recommendations for Lambda functions.

       Recommendations  are  exported in a comma-separated values (.csv) file,
       and its metadata in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)  (.json)  file,
       to  an  existing  Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that
       you specify. For more information, see Exporting Recommendations in the
       Compute Optimizer User Guide .

       You can have only one Lambda function export job in progress per Amazon
       Web Services Region.

OPTIONS
       --account-ids (list)
          The IDs of the Amazon Web Services  accounts  for  which  to  export
          Lambda function recommendations.

          If  your  account  is the management account of an organization, use
          this parameter to specify the member account for which you  want  to
          export recommendations.

          This  parameter cannot be specified together with the include member
          accounts parameter. The parameters are mutually exclusive.

          Recommendations for member accounts are not included in  the  export
          if  this  parameter,  or  the  include member accounts parameter, is
          omitted.

          You can specify multiple account IDs per request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          An array of objects to specify a filter that exports a more specific
          set of Lambda function recommendations.

          (structure)
              Describes  a  filter that returns a more specific list of Lambda
              function recommendations. Use this filter with  the   GetLambda-
              FunctionRecommendations action.

              You  can use EBSFilter with the  GetEBSVolumeRecommendations ac-
              tion, JobFilter with the   DescribeRecommendationExportJobs  ac-
              tion,  and  Filter  with the  GetAutoScalingGroupRecommendations
              and  GetEC2InstanceRecommendations actions.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 Specify Finding to return  recommendations  with  a  specific
                 finding classification (for example, NotOptimized ).

                 Specify  FindingReasonCode  to  return recommendations with a
                 specific finding reason code (for example,  MemoryUnderprovi-
                 sioned ).

                 You  can  filter  your  Lambda  function  recommendations  by
                 tag:key and tag-key tags.

                 A tag:key is a key and value combination of a tag assigned to
                 your  Lambda function recommendations. Use the tag key in the
                 filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For  exam-
                 ple,  to find all Lambda function recommendations that have a
                 tag with the key of Owner and the value of  TeamA  ,  specify
                 tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

                 A  tag-key  is the key of a tag assigned to your Lambda func-
                 tion recommendations. Use this filter to  find  all  of  your
                 Lambda  function  recommendations that have a tag with a spe-
                 cific key. This doesnt consider the tag value.  For  example,
                 you  can find your Lambda function recommendations with a tag
                 key value of Owner or without any tag keys assigned.

              values -> (list)
                 The value of the filter.

                 The valid values for this parameter are as follows, depending
                 on what you specify for the name parameter:

                 o Specify  Optimized  ,  NotOptimized , or Unavailable if you
                   specify the name parameter as Finding .

                 o Specify MemoryOverprovisioned  ,  MemoryUnderprovisioned  ,
                   InsufficientData  , or Inconclusive if you specify the name
                   parameter as FindingReasonCode .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

            }
            ...
          ]

       --fields-to-export (list)

       --s3-destination-config (structure)
          Describes the destination Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon  S3)
          bucket name and key prefix for a recommendations export job.

          You  must create the destination Amazon S3 bucket for your recommen-
          dations export before you create the export job.  Compute  Optimizer
          does  not  create  the  S3  bucket  for you. After you create the S3
          bucket, ensure that it has the required permission policy  to  allow
          Compute  Optimizer  to  write  the export file to it. If you plan to
          specify an object prefix when you create the export  job,  you  must
          include  the  object  prefix  in  the  policy that you add to the S3
          bucket. For more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket Policy  for  Com-
          pute Optimizer in the Compute Optimizer User Guide .

          bucket -> (string)
              The  name  of the Amazon S3 bucket to use as the destination for
              an export job.

          keyPrefix -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 bucket prefix for an export job.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bucket=string,keyPrefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "bucket": "string",
            "keyPrefix": "string"
          }

       --file-format (string)
          The format of the export file.

          The only export file format currently supported is Csv .

          Possible values:

          o Csv

       --include-member-accounts | --no-include-member-accounts (boolean)
          Indicates whether to include recommendations for  resources  in  all
          member  accounts  of the organization if your account is the manage-
          ment account of an organization.

          The member accounts must also be opted in to Compute Optimizer,  and
          trusted  access for Compute Optimizer must be enabled in the organi-
          zation account. For more information, see Compute Optimizer and Ama-
          zon  Web  Services Organizations trusted access in the Compute Opti-
          mizer User Guide .

          Recommendations for member accounts of the organization are not  in-
          cluded in the export file if this parameter is omitted.

          This parameter cannot be specified together with the account IDs pa-
          rameter. The parameters are mutually exclusive.

          Recommendations for member accounts are not included in  the  export
          if this parameter, or the account IDs parameter, is omitted.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       jobId -> (string)
          The identification number of the export job.

          Use  the   DescribeRecommendationExportJobs  action, and specify the
          job ID to view the status of an export job.
