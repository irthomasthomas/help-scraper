UPDATE-ENROLLMENT-STATUS()                          UPDATE-ENROLLMENT-STATUS()



NAME
       update-enrollment-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the enrollment (opt in and opt out) status of an account to the
       Compute Optimizer service.

       If the account is a management account of an organization, this  action
       can also be used to enroll member accounts of the organization.

       You  must  have  the appropriate permissions to opt in to Compute Opti-
       mizer, to view its recommendations, and to opt out. For  more  informa-
       tion,  see Controlling access with Amazon Web Services Identity and Ac-
       cess Management in the Compute Optimizer User Guide .

       When you  opt  in,  Compute  Optimizer  automatically  creates  a  ser-
       vice-linked  role in your account to access its data. For more informa-
       tion, see Using Service-Linked Roles for Compute Optimizer in the  Com-
       pute Optimizer User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          The new enrollment status of the account.

          The following status options are available:

          o Active  -  Opts  in your account to the Compute Optimizer service.
            Compute Optimizer begins analyzing the configuration and  utiliza-
            tion  metrics  of your Amazon Web Services resources after you opt
            in. For more information, see Metrics analyzed  by  Compute  Opti-
            mizer in the Compute Optimizer User Guide .

          o Inactive  -  Opts out your account from the Compute Optimizer ser-
            vice. Your account's recommendations and related metrics data will
            be deleted from Compute Optimizer after you opt out.

          NOTE:
              The  Pending and Failed options cannot be used to update the en-
              rollment status of an account. They are returned in the response
              of a request to update the enrollment status of an account.

          Possible values:

          o Active

          o Inactive

          o Pending

          o Failed

       --include-member-accounts | --no-include-member-accounts (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  to enroll member accounts of the organization if
          the account is the management account of an organization.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       status -> (string)
          The enrollment status of the account.

       statusReason -> (string)
          The reason for the enrollment status of the account. For example, an
          account might show a status of Pending because member accounts of an
          organization require more time to be enrolled in the service.
