OPTIONS
       --service-arns (list)
          The ARN that identifies the Amazon ECS service.

          The following is the format of the ARN:
              arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:service/cluster-name/ser-
              vice-name

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  to advance to the next page of Amazon ECS service recom-
          mendations.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of Amazon ECS service recommendations  to  return
          with a single request.

          To retrieve the remaining results, make another request with the re-
          turned nextToken value.

       --filters (list)
          An array of objects to specify a filter that returns a more specific
          list of Amazon ECS service recommendations.

          (structure)
              Describes  a  filter that returns a more specific list of Amazon
              ECS service recommendations. Use this filter  with  the   GetEC-
              SServiceRecommendations action.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 Specify  Finding  to  return  recommendations with a specific
                 finding classification.

                 Specify FindingReasonCode to return  recommendations  with  a
                 specific finding reason code.

                 You  can  filter  your  Amazon ECS service recommendations by
                 tag:key and tag-key tags.

                 A tag:key is a key and value combination of a tag assigned to
                 your  Amazon  ECS service recommendations. Use the tag key in
                 the filter name and the tag value as the  filter  value.  For
                 example,  to find all Amazon ECS service recommendations that
                 have a tag with the key of Owner and the  value  of  TeamA  ,
                 specify  tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the fil-
                 ter value.

                 A tag-key is the key of a tag assigned  to  your  Amazon  ECS
                 service  recommendations. Use this filter to find all of your
                 Amazon ECS service recommendations that have  a  tag  with  a
                 specific  key.  This doesnt consider the tag value. For exam-
                 ple, you can find your  Amazon  ECS  service  recommendations
                 with  a  tag  key  value of Owner or without any tag keys as-
                 signed.

              values -> (list)
                 The value of the filter.

                 The valid values for this parameter are as follows:

                 o If you specify the name parameter as Finding , specify  Op-
                   timized , NotOptimized , or Unavailable .

                 o If  you  specify  the name parameter as FindingReasonCode ,
                   specify CPUUnderprovisioned ,  CPUOverprovisioned  ,  Memo-
                   ryUnderprovisioned , or MemoryOverprovisioned .

              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --account-ids (list)
          Return  the Amazon ECS service recommendations to the specified Ama-
          zon Web Services account IDs.

          If your account is the management account or the delegated  adminis-
          trator  of  an organization, use this parameter to return the Amazon
          ECS service recommendations to specific member accounts.

          You can only specify one account ID per request.

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                     To determine the performance difference between your cur-
                     rent Amazon ECS service and the recommended option,  com-
                     pare  the utilization metric data of your service against
                     its projected utilization metric data.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the utilization metric.

                        The following utilization metrics are available:

                        o Cpu  The amount of CPU capacity that's used  in  the
                          service.

                        o Memory  The amount of memory that's used in the ser-

                        The statistic of the utilization metric.

                        The Compute  Optimizer  API,  Command  Line  Interface
                        (CLI),  and SDKs return utilization metrics using only
                        the Maximum statistic, which is the highest value  ob-
                        served during the specified period.

                        The Compute Optimizer console displays graphs for some
                        utilization metrics using the Average statistic, which
                        is the value of Sum / SampleCount during the specified
                        period. For more  information,  see  Viewing  resource
                        recommendations  in the Compute Optimizer User Guide .
                        You can also get averaged utilization metric data  for
                        your  resources  using Amazon CloudWatch. For more in-
                        formation, see the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide .
