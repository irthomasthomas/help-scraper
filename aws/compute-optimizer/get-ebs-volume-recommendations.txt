OPTIONS
       --volume-arns (list)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the volumes for  which  to  return
          recommendations.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-token (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of volume recommendations.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of volume recommendations to return with a single
          request.

          To retrieve the remaining results, make another request with the re-
          turned nextToken value.

       --filters (list)
          An array of objects to specify a filter that returns a more specific
          list of volume recommendations.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter that returns a more specific list  of  Amazon
              Elastic  Block  Store  (Amazon  EBS) volume recommendations. Use
              this filter with the  GetEBSVolumeRecommendations action.

              You can use LambdaFunctionRecommendationFilter  with  the   Get-
              LambdaFunctionRecommendations  action,  JobFilter  with the  De-
              scribeRecommendationExportJobs  action,  and  Filter  with   the
              GetAutoScalingGroupRecommendations  and  GetEC2InstanceRecommen-
              dations actions.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 Specify Finding to return  recommendations  with  a  specific
                 finding classification (for example, NotOptimized ).

                 You  can  filter  your  Amazon  EBS volume recommendations by
                 tag:key and tag-key tags.

                 A tag:key is a key and value combination of a tag assigned to
                 your  Amazon  EBS  volume recommendations. Use the tag key in
                 the filter name and the tag value as the  filter  value.  For
                 example,  to  find all Amazon EBS volume recommendations that
                 have a tag with the key of Owner and the  value  of  TeamA  ,
                 specify  tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the fil-
                 ter value.

                 A tag-key is the key of a tag assigned  to  your  Amazon  EBS
                 volume  recommendations.  Use this filter to find all of your
                 Amazon EBS volume recommendations that have a tag with a spe-
                 cific  key.  This doesnt consider the tag value. For example,
                 you can find your Amazon EBS volume  recommendations  with  a
                 tag key value of Owner or without any tag keys assigned.

              values -> (list)
                 The value of the filter.

                 The valid values are Optimized , or NotOptimized .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "Finding",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --account-ids (list)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account for which to return volume
          recommendations.

          If your account is the management account of  an  organization,  use
          this  parameter  to specify the member account for which you want to
          return volume recommendations.

          Only one account ID can be specified per request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                     Store (Amazon EBS) volume.

                     Compare the utilization  metric  data  of  your  resource
                     against  its  projected utilization metric data to deter-
                     mine the performance difference between your current  re-

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the utilization metric.

                        The following utilization metrics are available:

                        o VolumeReadOpsPerSecond  -  The completed read opera-
                          tions per second from the volume in a specified  pe-
                          riod of time. Unit: Count

                        o VolumeWriteOpsPerSecond - The completed write opera-
                          tions per second to the volume in a specified period
                          of time. Unit: Count

                        o VolumeReadBytesPerSecond - The bytes read per second
                          from the volume in a specified period of time. Unit:
                          Bytes

                        o VolumeWriteBytesPerSecond - The bytes written to the
                          volume in a specified period of time. Unit: Bytes

                     statistic -> (string)
                        The statistic of the utilization metric.

                        (CLI),  and SDKs return utilization metrics using only
                        the Maximum statistic, which is the highest value  ob-
                        served during the specified period.

                        The Compute Optimizer console displays graphs for some
                        utilization metrics using the Average statistic, which
                        is the value of Sum / SampleCount during the specified
                        period. For more  information,  see  Viewing  resource
                        recommendations  in the Compute Optimizer User Guide .
                        You can also get averaged utilization metric data  for
                        your  resources  using Amazon CloudWatch. For more in-

                     Block Store (Amazon EBS) instance.

                     configuration -> (structure)
                        An  array of objects that describe a volume configura-
                        tion.

                        volumeType -> (string)
                            The volume type.

                            This can be gp2 for General Purpose  SSD,  io1  or
                            io2  for  Provisioned IOPS SSD, st1 for Throughput
                            Optimized HDD, sc1 for Cold HDD, or  standard  for

                        volumeBaselineThroughput -> (integer)
                            The baseline throughput of the volume.

                        volumeBurstThroughput -> (integer)

                            ing launch.

                     performanceRisk -> (double)
                        The performance risk of the volume recommendation  op-
                        tion.

                        Performance  risk is the likelihood of the recommended
                        volume type meeting  the  performance  requirement  of
                        your workload.

                        The  value ranges from 0 - 4 , with 0 meaning that the
                        recommended resource is predicted  to  always  provide
                        enough hardware capability. The higher the performance
                        risk is, the more likely you should  validate  whether
                        the  recommendation will meet the performance require-
                        ments of your workload before migrating your resource.

                        the EBS volume recommendation option. Savings opportu-
                        nity includes the estimated monthly savings amount and
                        percentage.

                            The  estimated  monthly savings possible as a per-

                        estimatedMonthlySavings -> (structure)
                            An  object  that  describes  the estimated monthly
