OPTIONS
       --resource-arns (list)
          The ARN that identifies the idle resource.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-token (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of idle  resource  recommenda-
          tions.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of idle resource recommendations to return with a
          single request.

          To retrieve the remaining results, make another request with the re-
          turned nextToken value.

       --filters (list)
          An array of objects to specify a filter that returns a more specific
          list of idle resource recommendations.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter that returns a more specific list of idle re-
              source recommendations.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 Specify  Finding  to  return  recommendations with a specific
                 finding classification.

                 You can filter your idle resource recommendations by  tag:key
                 and tag-key tags.

                 A tag:key is a key and value combination of a tag assigned to
                 your idle resource recommendations. Use the tag  key  in  the
                 filter  name and the tag value as the filter value. For exam-
                 ple, to find all idle resource service  recommendations  that
                 have  a  tag  with  the key of Owner and the value of TeamA ,
                 specify tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the  fil-
                 ter value.

                 A  tag-key is the key of a tag assigned to your idle resource
                 recommendations. Use this filter to find all of your idle re-
                 source  recommendations  that have a tag with a specific key.
                 This doesnt consider the tag value. For example, you can find
                 your  idle  resource  service  recommendations with a tag key
                 value of Owner or without any tag keys assigned.

              values -> (list)
                 The value of the filter.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "Finding"|"ResourceType",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --account-ids (list)
          Return the idle resource recommendations to the specified Amazon Web
          Services account IDs.

          If  your account is the management account or the delegated adminis-
          trator of an organization, use this parameter to return the idle re-
          source recommendations to specific member accounts.

          You can only specify one account ID per request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --order-by (structure)
          The order to sort the idle resource recommendations.

          dimension -> (string)
              The dimension values to sort the recommendations.

          order -> (string)
              The order to sort the recommendations.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          dimension=string,order=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "dimension": "SavingsValue"|"SavingsValueAfterDiscount",
            "order": "Asc"|"Desc"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
