EXPORT-EC2-INSTANCE-RECOMMENDATIONS()    EXPORT-EC2-INSTANCE-RECOMMENDATIONS()



NAME
       export-ec2-instance-recommendations -

DESCRIPTION
       Exports optimization recommendations for Amazon EC2 instances.

       Recommendations  are  exported in a comma-separated values (.csv) file,
       and its metadata in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)  (.json)  file,
       to  an  existing  Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that
       you specify. For more information, see Exporting Recommendations in the
       Compute Optimizer User Guide .

       You  can  have  only one Amazon EC2 instance export job in progress per
       Amazon Web Services Region.

OPTIONS
       --account-ids (list)
          The IDs of the Amazon Web Services accounts for which to export  in-
          stance recommendations.

          If  your  account  is the management account of an organization, use
          this parameter to specify the member account for which you  want  to
          export recommendations.

          This  parameter cannot be specified together with the include member
          accounts parameter. The parameters are mutually exclusive.

          Recommendations for member accounts are not included in  the  export
          if  this  parameter,  or  the  include member accounts parameter, is
          omitted.

          You can specify multiple account IDs per request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          An array of objects to specify a filter that exports a more specific
          set of instance recommendations.

          (structure)
              Describes  a  filter that returns a more specific list of recom-
              mendations. Use this filter with the   GetAutoScalingGroupRecom-
              mendations and  GetEC2InstanceRecommendations actions.

              You  can use EBSFilter with the  GetEBSVolumeRecommendations ac-
              tion, LambdaFunctionRecommendationFilter  with  the   GetLambda-
              FunctionRecommendations  action,  and  JobFilter  with  the  De-
              scribeRecommendationExportJobs action.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 Specify Finding to return  recommendations  with  a  specific
                 finding classification. For example, Underprovisioned .

                 Specify RecommendationSourceType to return recommendations of
                 a specific resource type. For example, Ec2Instance .

                 Specify FindingReasonCodes to return recommendations  with  a
                 specific  finding  reason  code.  For example, CPUUnderprovi-
                 sioned .

                 Specify InferredWorkloadTypes to return recommendations of  a
                 specific inferred workload. For example, Redis .

                 You  can  filter your EC2 instance recommendations by tag:key
                 and tag-key tags.

                 A tag:key is a key and value combination of a tag assigned to
                 your  recommendations. Use the tag key in the filter name and
                 the tag value as the filter value. For example, to  find  all
                 recommendations that have a tag with the key of Owner and the
                 value of TeamA , specify tag:Owner for the  filter  name  and
                 TeamA for the filter value.

                 A  tag-key  is  the key of a tag assigned to your recommenda-
                 tions. Use this filter to find all  of  your  recommendations
                 that have a tag with a specific key. This doesnt consider the
                 tag value. For example, you  can  find  your  recommendations
                 with  a  tag  key  value of Owner or without any tag keys as-
                 signed.

              values -> (list)
                 The value of the filter.

                 The valid values for this parameter are as follows, depending
                 on  what  you specify for the name parameter and the resource
                 type that you wish to filter results for:

                 o Specify Optimized or NotOptimized if you specify  the  name
                   parameter  as  Finding  and  you want to filter results for
                   Auto Scaling groups.

                 o Specify Underprovisioned , Overprovisioned ,  or  Optimized
                   if  you  specify the name parameter as Finding and you want
                   to filter results for EC2 instances.

                 o Specify Ec2Instance or AutoScalingGroup if you specify  the
                   name parameter as RecommendationSourceType .

                 o Specify  one  of  the  following options if you specify the
                   name parameter as FindingReasonCodes :

       --s3-destination-config (structure)
          An object to specify the destination Amazon Simple  Storage  Service
          (Amazon S3) bucket name and key prefix for the export job.

          You  must create the destination Amazon S3 bucket for your recommen-
          dations export before you create the export job.  Compute  Optimizer
          does  not  create  the  S3  bucket  for you. After you create the S3
          bucket, ensure that it has the required permissions policy to  allow
          Compute  Optimizer  to  write  the export file to it. If you plan to
          specify an object prefix when you create the export  job,  you  must
          include  the  object  prefix  in  the  policy that you add to the S3
          bucket. For more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket Policy  for  Com-
          pute Optimizer in the Compute Optimizer User Guide .

       --include-member-accounts | --no-include-member-accounts (boolean)
          Indicates whether to include recommendations for  resources  in  all
          member  accounts  of the organization if your account is the manage-
          ment account of an organization.

          The member accounts must also be opted in to Compute Optimizer,  and
          trusted  access for Compute Optimizer must be enabled in the organi-
          zation account. For more information, see Compute Optimizer and Ama-
          zon  Web  Services Organizations trusted access in the Compute Opti-
          mizer User Guide .

          Recommendations for member accounts of the organization are not  in-
          cluded in the export file if this parameter is omitted.

          Recommendations  for  member accounts are not included in the export
          if this parameter, or the account IDs parameter, is omitted.

              stance and Auto Scaling group recommendations.

              For example, when you specify AWS_ARM64 with:

              o A  GetEC2InstanceRecommendations or  GetAutoScalingGroupRecom-
                mendations  request, Compute Optimizer returns recommendations
                that consist of Graviton instance types only.

              o A  GetEC2RecommendationProjectedMetrics request, Compute Opti-
                mizer  returns  projected utilization metrics for Graviton in-
                stance type recommendations only.

              o A   ExportEC2InstanceRecommendations  or    ExportAutoScaling-
                GroupRecommendations request, Compute Optimizer exports recom-
                mendations that consist of Graviton instance types only.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          cpuVendorArchitectures=string,string

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-

       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
