OPTIONS
       --service-arn (string)
          The ARN that identifies the Amazon ECS service.

          The following is the format of the ARN:
              arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:service/cluster-name/ser-
              vice-name

       --stat (string)
          The statistic of the projected metrics.

          Possible values:

          o Maximum

          o Average

       --period (integer)
          The granularity, in seconds, of the projected metrics data points.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The timestamp of the first projected metrics data point to return.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The timestamp of the last projected metrics data point to return.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       recommendedOptionProjectedMetrics -> (list)
          An array of objects that describes the projected metrics.

          (structure)
              Describes the projected metrics of an Amazon ECS service  recom-
              mendation option.

              To  determine  the  performance  difference between your current
              Amazon ECS service and the recommended option, compare the  met-
              ric data of your service against its projected metric data.

              recommendedCpuUnits -> (integer)
                 The recommended CPU size for the Amazon ECS service.

              recommendedMemorySize -> (integer)
                 The recommended memory size for the Amazon ECS service.

              projectedMetrics -> (list)
                 An array of objects that describe the projected metric.

                 (structure)
                     Describes  the projected metrics of an Amazon ECS service
                     recommendation option.

                     To determine the performance difference between your cur-
                     rent  Amazon ECS service and the recommended option, com-
                     pare the metric data of your  service  against  its  pro-
                     jected metric data.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the projected metric.

                        The following metrics are available:

                        o Cpu   The percentage of allocated compute units that
                          are currently in use on the service tasks.

                        o Memory  The percentage of memory that's currently in
                          use on the service tasks.

                     timestamps -> (list)
                        The timestamps of the projected metric.

                        (timestamp)

                     upperBoundValues -> (list)
                        The upper bound values for the projected metric.

                        (double)

                     lowerBoundValues -> (list)
                        The lower bound values for the projected metric.

                        (double)
