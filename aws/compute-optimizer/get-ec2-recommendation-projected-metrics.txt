       get-ec2-recommendation-projected-metrics -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the projected utilization metrics of Amazon EC2 instance recom-
       mendations.

       NOTE:
          The Cpu and Memory metrics are the only projected  utilization  met-
          rics  returned  when  you  run this action. Additionally, the Memory
          metric is returned only for resources that have the  unified  Cloud-
          Watch  agent  installed  on them. For more information, see Enabling
          Memory Utilization with the CloudWatch Agent .

          Possible values:

          o Maximum

          o Average

       --period (integer)
          The granularity, in seconds, of the projected metrics data points.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The timestamp of the first projected metrics data point to return.

          The timestamp of the last projected metrics data point to return.

       --recommendation-preferences (structure)
          An  object to specify the preferences for the Amazon EC2 recommenda-
          tion projected metrics to return in the response.

          cpuVendorArchitectures -> (list)
              Specifies the CPU vendor and architecture  for  Amazon  EC2  in-
              stance and Auto Scaling group recommendations.

              For example, when you specify AWS_ARM64 with:

              o A  GetEC2InstanceRecommendations or  GetAutoScalingGroupRecom-
                mendations request, Compute Optimizer returns  recommendations
                that consist of Graviton instance types only.

              o A  GetEC2RecommendationProjectedMetrics request, Compute Opti-
                mizer returns projected utilization metrics for  Graviton  in-
                stance type recommendations only.

              o A    ExportEC2InstanceRecommendations  or   ExportAutoScaling-
                GroupRecommendations request, Compute Optimizer exports recom-
                mendations that consist of Graviton instance types only.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          cpuVendorArchitectures=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "cpuVendorArchitectures": ["AWS_ARM64"|"CURRENT", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       recommendedOptionProjectedMetrics -> (list)
          An array of objects that describes projected metrics.

          (structure)
              Describes a projected utilization metric of a recommendation op-
              tion.

              NOTE:
                 The Cpu and Memory metrics are the only projected utilization
                 metrics returned when you run  the   GetEC2RecommendationPro-
                 jectedMetrics  action. Additionally, the Memory metric is re-
                 turned only for resources that have  the  unified  CloudWatch
                 agent  installed  on them. For more information, see Enabling
                 Memory Utilization with the CloudWatch Agent .

              recommendedInstanceType -> (string)
                 The recommended instance type.

              rank -> (integer)
                 The rank of the recommendation option projected metric.

                 The top recommendation option is ranked as 1 .

                 The projected metric rank correlates  to  the  recommendation
                 option rank. For example, the projected metric ranked as 1 is
                 related to the recommendation option that is also ranked as 1
                 in the same response.

              projectedMetrics -> (list)
                 An  array  of  objects  that describe a projected utilization
                 metric.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a projected utilization metric of a recommenda-
                     tion  option, such as an Amazon EC2 instance. This repre-
                     sents the projected utilization of a  recommendation  op-
                     tion  had  you used that resource during the analyzed pe-
                     riod.

                     Compare the utilization  metric  data  of  your  resource
                     against  its  projected utilization metric data to deter-
                     mine the performance difference between your current  re-
                     source and the recommended option.

                     NOTE:
                        The  Cpu  ,  Memory , GPU , and GPU_MEMORY metrics are
                        the only projected utilization metrics  returned  when
                        you  run the  GetEC2RecommendationProjectedMetrics ac-
                        tion. Additionally, these metrics  are  only  returned
                        for  resources  with  the unified CloudWatch agent in-
                        stalled on them. For more  information,  see  Enabling
                        Memory  Utilization  with  the  CloudWatch  Agent  and
                        Enabling NVIDIA GPU utilization  with  the  CloudWatch
                        Agent .

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the projected utilization metric.

                        The  following  projected  utilization metrics are re-
                        turned:

                        o Cpu - The projected percentage of allocated EC2 com-
                          pute  units  that would be in use on the recommenda-
                          tion option had you used that  resource  during  the
                          analyzed period. This metric identifies the process-
                          ing power required to run an application on the rec-
                          ommendation  option. Depending on the instance type,
                          tools in your operating system can show a lower per-
                          centage than CloudWatch when the instance is not al-
                          located a full processor core.

                        o Memory - The percentage of memory that would  be  in
                          use  on  the recommendation option had you used that
                          resource during the  analyzed  period.  This  metric
                          identifies  the  amount of memory required to run an
                          application on  the  recommendation  option.  Units:
                          Percent

                        NOTE:
                            The  Memory  metric is only returned for resources
                            with the unified  CloudWatch  agent  installed  on
                            them.  For  more  information, see Enabling Memory
                            Utilization with the CloudWatch Agent .

                        o GPU - The projected percentage of allocated GPUs  if
                          you  adjust  your  configurations  to  Compute Opti-
                          mizer's recommendation option.

                        o GPU_MEMORY - The projected percentage of  total  GPU
                          memory  if you adjust your configurations to Compute
                          Optimizer's recommendation option.

                        NOTE:
                            The GPU and GPU_MEMORY metrics are  only  returned
                            for  resources  with  the unified CloudWatch Agent
                            installed  on  them.  For  more  information,  see
                            Enabling  NVIDIA  GPU  utilization with the Cloud-
                            Watch Agent .

                     timestamps -> (list)
                        The timestamps of the projected utilization metric.

                        (timestamp)

                     values -> (list)
                        The values of the projected utilization metrics.
