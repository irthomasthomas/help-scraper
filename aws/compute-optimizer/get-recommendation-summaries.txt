OPTIONS
       --account-ids (list)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account for which to return recom-
          mendation summaries.

          If  your  account  is the management account of an organization, use
          this parameter to specify the member account for which you  want  to
          return recommendation summaries.

          Only one account ID can be specified per request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-token (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of recommendation summaries.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of recommendation summaries to return with a sin-
          gle request.

          To retrieve the remaining results, make another request with the re-
          turned nextToken value.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)
