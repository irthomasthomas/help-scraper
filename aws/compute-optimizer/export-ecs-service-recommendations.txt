NAME
       export-ecs-service-recommendations -

DESCRIPTION
       Exports  optimization  recommendations  for Amazon ECS services on Far-
       gate.

       Recommendations are exported in a CSV file, and its metadata in a  JSON
       file,  to  an existing Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket
       that you specify. For more information, see  Exporting  Recommendations
       in the Compute Optimizer User Guide .

       You  can  only  have  one Amazon ECS service export job in progress per
       Amazon Web Services Region.

OPTIONS
       --account-ids (list)
          The Amazon Web Services account IDs for the export Amazon  ECS  ser-
          vice recommendations.

          If  your account is the management account or the delegated adminis-
          trator of an organization, use this parameter to specify the  member
          account you want to export recommendations to.

          This  parameter  can't be specified together with the include member
          accounts parameter. The parameters are mutually exclusive.

          If this parameter or the include member accounts parameter is  omit-
          ted,  the recommendations for member accounts aren't included in the
          export.

          You can specify multiple account IDs per request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          An array of objects to specify a filter that exports a more specific
          set of Amazon ECS service recommendations.

          (structure)
              Describes  a  filter that returns a more specific list of Amazon
              ECS service recommendations. Use this filter  with  the   GetEC-
              SServiceRecommendations action.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 Specify  Finding  to  return  recommendations with a specific
                 finding classification.

                 Specify FindingReasonCode to return  recommendations  with  a
                 specific finding reason code.

                 You  can  filter  your  Amazon ECS service recommendations by
                 tag:key and tag-key tags.

                 A tag:key is a key and value combination of a tag assigned to
                 your  Amazon  ECS service recommendations. Use the tag key in
                 the filter name and the tag value as the  filter  value.  For
                 example,  to find all Amazon ECS service recommendations that
                 have a tag with the key of Owner and the  value  of  TeamA  ,
                 specify  tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the fil-
                 ter value.

                 A tag-key is the key of a tag assigned  to  your  Amazon  ECS
                 service  recommendations. Use this filter to find all of your
                 Amazon ECS service recommendations that have  a  tag  with  a
                 specific  key.  This doesnt consider the tag value. For exam-
                 ple, you can find your  Amazon  ECS  service  recommendations
                 with  a  tag  key  value of Owner or without any tag keys as-
                 signed.

              values -> (list)
                 The value of the filter.

                 The valid values for this parameter are as follows:

                 o If you specify the name parameter as Finding , specify  Op-
                   timized , Underprovisioned , or Overprovisioned .

                 o If  you  specify  the name parameter as FindingReasonCode ,
                   specify CPUUnderprovisioned ,  CPUOverprovisioned  ,  Memo-
                   ryUnderprovisioned , or MemoryOverprovisioned .

            }
            ...
          ]

       --fields-to-export (list)
          The recommendations data to include in the export file. For more in-
          formation about the fields that can be exported, see Exported  files

       --s3-destination-config (structure)
          Describes  the destination Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
          bucket name and key prefix for a recommendations export job.

          You must create the destination Amazon S3 bucket for your  recommen-
          dations  export  before you create the export job. Compute Optimizer
          does not create the S3 bucket for  you.  After  you  create  the  S3
          bucket,  ensure  that it has the required permission policy to allow
          Compute Optimizer to write the export file to it.  If  you  plan  to
          specify  an  object  prefix when you create the export job, you must
          include the object prefix in the policy  that  you  add  to  the  S3
          bucket.  For  more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket Policy for Com-
          pute Optimizer in the Compute Optimizer User Guide .

          bucket -> (string)
              The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to use as the  destination  for
              an export job.

          keyPrefix -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 bucket prefix for an export job.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bucket=string,keyPrefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "bucket": "string",
            "keyPrefix": "string"
          }

       --file-format (string)
          The format of the export file.

          The CSV file is the only export file format currently supported.

          Possible values:

          o Csv

       --include-member-accounts | --no-include-member-accounts (boolean)
          If  your account is the management account or the delegated adminis-
          trator of an organization, this parameter indicates whether  to  in-
          clude  recommendations  for  resources in all member accounts of the
          organization.

          The member accounts must also be opted in to Compute Optimizer,  and
          trusted  access for Compute Optimizer must be enabled in the organi-
          zation account. For more information, see Compute Optimizer and Ama-
          zon  Web  Services Organizations trusted access in the Compute Opti-
          mizer User Guide .

          If this parameter is omitted, recommendations for member accounts of
          the organization aren't included in the export file.

          If  this parameter or the account ID parameter is omitted, recommen-
          dations for member accounts aren't included in the export.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

OUTPUT
       jobId -> (string)
          The identification number of the export job.
