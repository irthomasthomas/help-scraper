EXPORT-LICENSE-RECOMMENDATIONS()              EXPORT-LICENSE-RECOMMENDATIONS()



NAME
       export-license-recommendations -

DESCRIPTION
       Export optimization recommendations for your licenses.

       Recommendations  are  exported  in a comma-separated values (CSV) file,
       and its metadata in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file, to an ex-
       isting  Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that you spec-
       ify. For more information, see Exporting Recommendations in the Compute
       Optimizer User Guide .

       You  can  have  only  one license export job in progress per Amazon Web
       Services Region.

OPTIONS
       --account-ids (list)
          The IDs of the Amazon Web Services accounts for which to export  li-
          cense recommendations.

          If  your  account  is the management account of an organization, use
          this parameter to specify the member account for which you  want  to
          export recommendations.

          This  parameter  can't be specified together with the include member
          accounts parameter. The parameters are mutually exclusive.

          If this parameter is omitted, recommendations  for  member  accounts
          aren't included in the export.

          You can specify multiple account IDs per request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          An array of objects to specify a filter that exports a more specific
          set of license recommendations.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter that returns a more specific list of  license
              recommendations.  Use this filter with the GetLicenseRecommenda-
              tion action.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 Specify Finding to return  recommendations  with  a  specific
                 finding classification.

                 Specify  FindingReasonCode  to  return recommendations with a
                 specific finding reason code.

                 You can filter your license recommendations  by  tag:key  and
                 tag-key tags.

                 A tag:key is a key and value combination of a tag assigned to
                 your license recommendations. Use the tag key in  the  filter
                 name  and  the tag value as the filter value. For example, to
                 find all license recommendations that have a tag with the key
                 of  Owner  and the value of TeamA , specify tag:Owner for the
                 filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

                 A tag-key is the key of a tag assigned to your license recom-
                 mendations.  Use this filter to find all of your license rec-
                 ommendations that have a tag with a specific key. This doesnt
                 consider  the  tag  value. For example, you can find your li-
                 cense recommendations with a tag key value of Owner or  with-
                 out any tag keys assigned.

              values -> (list)
                 The value of the filter.

                 The valid values for this parameter are as follows, depending
                 on what you specify for the name parameter:

                 o If you specify the name parameter as Finding , then specify
                   Optimized , NotOptimized , or InsufficentMetrics .

                 o If  you  specify  the name parameter as FindingReasonCode ,
                   then specify Optimized , LicenseOverprovisioned ,  Invalid-
                   CloudwatchApplicationInsights , or CloudwatchApplicationIn-
                   sightsError .

       --s3-destination-config (structure)
          Describes the destination Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon  S3)
          bucket name and key prefix for a recommendations export job.

          You  must create the destination Amazon S3 bucket for your recommen-
          dations export before you create the export job.  Compute  Optimizer
          does  not  create  the  S3  bucket  for you. After you create the S3
          bucket, ensure that it has the required permission policy  to  allow
          Compute  Optimizer  to  write  the export file to it. If you plan to
          specify an object prefix when you create the export  job,  you  must
          include  the  object  prefix  in  the  policy that you add to the S3
          bucket. For more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket Policy  for  Com-
          pute Optimizer in the Compute Optimizer User Guide .

          bucket -> (string)
              The  name  of the Amazon S3 bucket to use as the destination for
              an export job.

          keyPrefix -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 bucket prefix for an export job.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bucket=string,keyPrefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "bucket": "string",
            "keyPrefix": "string"
          }

       --file-format (string)
          The format of the export file.

          A CSV file is the only export format currently supported.

          Possible values:

          o Csv

       --include-member-accounts | --no-include-member-accounts (boolean)
          Indicates whether to include recommendations for  resources  in  all
          member  accounts  of the organization if your account is the manage-
          ment account of an organization.

          The member accounts must also be opted in to Compute Optimizer,  and
          trusted  access for Compute Optimizer must be enabled in the organi-
          zation account. For more information, see Compute Optimizer and Ama-
          zon  Web  Services Organizations trusted access in the Compute Opti-
          mizer User Guide .

          If this parameter is omitted, recommendations for member accounts of
          the organization aren't included in the export file .

          This parameter cannot be specified together with the account IDs pa-
          rameter. The parameters are mutually exclusive.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
