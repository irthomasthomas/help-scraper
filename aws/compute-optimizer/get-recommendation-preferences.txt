NAME
       get-recommendation-preferences -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  existing  recommendation  preferences, such as enhanced infra-
       structure metrics.

       Use the scope parameter to specify which preferences to return. You can
       specify  to  return preferences for an organization, a specific account
       ID, or a specific EC2 instance or Auto Scaling  group  Amazon  Resource
       Name (ARN).

       For more information, see Activating enhanced infrastructure metrics in
       the Compute Optimizer User Guide .

       get-recommendation-preferences is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: recommendationPreferencesDetails

OPTIONS
       --resource-type (string)
          The  target resource type of the recommendation preference for which
          to return preferences.

          The Ec2Instance option  encompasses  standalone  instances  and  in-
          stances  that  are part of Auto Scaling groups. The AutoScalingGroup
          option encompasses only instances that are part of an  Auto  Scaling
          group.

          NOTE:
              The  valid  values  for  this  parameter are Ec2Instance and Au-
              toScalingGroup .

          Possible values:

          o Ec2Instance

          o AutoScalingGroup

          o EbsVolume

          o LambdaFunction

          o NotApplicable

          o EcsService

          o License

       --scope (structure)
          An object that describes the scope of the recommendation  preference
          to return.

          You  can  return  recommendation preferences that are created at the
          organization level  (for  management  accounts  of  an  organization
          only),  account level, and resource level. For more information, see
          Activating enhanced infrastructure metrics in the Compute  Optimizer
          User Guide .

          name -> (string)
              The name of the scope.

              The following scopes are possible:

              o Organization  -  Specifies  that the recommendation preference
                applies at the organization level, for all member accounts  of
                an organization.

              o AccountId  -  Specifies that the recommendation preference ap-
                plies at the account level, for all resources of a  given  re-
                source type in an account.

              o ResourceArn - Specifies that the recommendation preference ap-
                plies at the individual resource level.

          value -> (string)
              The value of the scope.

              If you specified the name of the scope as:

              o Organization - The value must be ALL_ACCOUNTS .

              o AccountId - The value must be a 12-digit Amazon  Web  Services
                account ID.

              o ResourceArn - The value must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                of an EC2 instance or an Auto Scaling group.

              Only EC2 instance and Auto Scaling group ARNs are currently sup-
              ported.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,value=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "Organization"|"AccountId"|"ResourceArn",
            "value": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

                     The value of the scope.

                     If you specified the name of the scope as:

                     o Organization - The value must be ALL_ACCOUNTS .

                     o AccountId  -  The  value  must be a 12-digit Amazon Web

                 The target resource type of the recommendation preference  to
                 create.

                 The  Ec2Instance  option encompasses standalone instances and
                 instances that are part of Auto Scaling groups. The AutoScal-
                 ingGroup  option  encompasses only instances that are part of

                 tion preference.

                 When  the  recommendations page is refreshed, a status of Ac-
                 tive confirms that the preference is applied to the recommen-
                 dations,  and  a status of Inactive confirms that the prefer-
                 ence isn't yet applied to recommendations.

                 For more information, see Enhanced infrastructure metrics  in
                 the Compute Optimizer User Guide .

                 dations, and a status of Inactive confirms that  the  prefer-
                 ence isn't yet applied to recommendations.

              externalMetricsPreference -> (structure)
                 An  object that describes the external metrics recommendation
                 preference.

                 If the preference is applied in the latest recommendation re-
                 fresh, an object with a valid source value appears in the re-
                 sponse. If the preference isn't applied  to  the  recommenda-
                 tions  already,  then  this  object doesn't appear in the re-
                 sponse.

                 source -> (string)
