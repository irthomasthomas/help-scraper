OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An array of objects to specify a filter that returns a more specific
          list of account enrollment statuses.

          (structure)
              Describes  a filter that returns a more specific list of account
              enrollment statuses. Use this filter with the  GetEnrollmentSta-
              tusesForOrganization action.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 Specify  Status to return accounts with a specific enrollment
                 status (for example, Active ).

              values -> (list)
                 The value of the filter.

                 The valid values are Active , Inactive , Pending , and Failed
                 .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "Status",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  to  advance  to the next page of account enrollment sta-
          tuses.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of account enrollment statuses to return  with  a
          single  request.  You  can specify up to 100 statuses to return with
          each request.

          To retrieve the remaining results, make another request with the re-
          turned nextToken value.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

OUTPUT
       accountEnrollmentStatuses -> (list)
          An array of objects that describe the enrollment statuses of organi-
          zation member accounts.

          (structure)
              Describes  the enrollment status of an organization's member ac-
              counts in Compute Optimizer.

                 For example, an account might show a status  of  Pending  be-
                 cause member accounts of an organization require more time to
                 be enrolled in the service.

              lastUpdatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix epoch timestamp, in seconds, of when the account en-
                 rollment status was last updated.

          The  token  to use to advance to the next page of account enrollment
          statuses.

          This value is null when there are no more pages of  account  enroll-
          ment statuses to return.
