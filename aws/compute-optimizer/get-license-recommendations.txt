OPTIONS
       --resource-arns (list)
          The ARN that identifies the Amazon EC2 instance.

          The following is the format of the ARN:
              arn:aws:ec2:region:aws_account_id:instance/instance-id

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-token (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of license recommendations.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of license recommendations to return with a  sin-
          gle request.

          To retrieve the remaining results, make another request with the re-
          turned nextToken value.

       --filters (list)
          An array of objects to specify a filter that returns a more specific
          list of license recommendations.

          (structure)
              Describes  a filter that returns a more specific list of license
              recommendations. Use this filter with the  GetLicenseRecommenda-
              tion action.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 Specify  Finding  to  return  recommendations with a specific
                 finding classification.

                 Specify FindingReasonCode to return  recommendations  with  a
                 specific finding reason code.

                 You  can  filter  your license recommendations by tag:key and
                 tag-key tags.

                 A tag:key is a key and value combination of a tag assigned to
                 your  license  recommendations. Use the tag key in the filter
                 name and the tag value as the filter value. For  example,  to
                 find all license recommendations that have a tag with the key
                 of Owner and the value of TeamA , specify tag:Owner  for  the
                 filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

                 A tag-key is the key of a tag assigned to your license recom-
                 mendations. Use this filter to find all of your license  rec-
                 ommendations that have a tag with a specific key. This doesnt
                 consider the tag value. For example, you can  find  your  li-
                 cense  recommendations with a tag key value of Owner or with-
                 out any tag keys assigned.

              values -> (list)
                 The value of the filter.

                 The valid values for this parameter are as follows, depending
                 on what you specify for the name parameter:

                 o If you specify the name parameter as Finding , then specify
                   Optimized , NotOptimized , or InsufficentMetrics .

                 o If you specify the name parameter  as  FindingReasonCode  ,
                   then  specify Optimized , LicenseOverprovisioned , Invalid-
                   CloudwatchApplicationInsights , or CloudwatchApplicationIn-
                   sightsError .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

              "name": "Finding"|"FindingReasonCode"|"LicenseName",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --account-ids (list)
          The  ID  of  the Amazon Web Services account for which to return li-
          cense recommendations.

          If your account is the management account of  an  organization,  use
          this  parameter  to specify the member account for which you want to
          return license recommendations.

          Only one account ID can be specified per request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

              mendations for an instance of an unsupported instance family.
