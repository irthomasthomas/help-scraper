NAME
       get-effective-recommendation-preferences -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  recommendation preferences that are in effect for a given
       resource, such as enhanced infrastructure metrics. Considers all appli-
       cable preferences that you might have set at the resource, account, and
       organization level.

       When you create a recommendation preference, you can set its status  to
       Active or Inactive . Use this action to view the recommendation prefer-
       ences that are in effect, or Active .

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource for which to  confirm
          effective  recommendation  preferences.  Only  EC2 instance and Auto
          Scaling group ARNs are currently supported.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

OUTPUT
       enhancedInfrastructureMetrics -> (string)
          The  status  of  the  enhanced infrastructure metrics recommendation
          preference. Considers all applicable preferences that you might have
          set at the resource, account, and organization level.

          A  status  of  Active confirms that the preference is applied in the
          latest recommendation refresh, and a  status  of  Inactive  confirms
          that it's not yet applied to recommendations.

          To validate whether the preference is applied to your last generated
          set of recommendations,  review  the  effectiveRecommendationPrefer-
          ences  value  in the response of the  GetAutoScalingGroupRecommenda-
          tions and  GetEC2InstanceRecommendations actions.

          For more information, see Enhanced  infrastructure  metrics  in  the
          Compute Optimizer User Guide .

       externalMetricsPreference -> (structure)
          The provider of the external metrics recommendation preference. Con-
          siders all applicable preferences that you might have set at the ac-

          If  the  preference is applied in the latest recommendation refresh,
          an object with a valid source value appears in the response. If  the
          preference  isn't  applied to the recommendations already, then this
          object doesn't appear in the response.

          To validate whether the preference is applied to your last generated
          set  of  recommendations,  review the effectiveRecommendationPrefer-
          ences value in the response  of  the   GetEC2InstanceRecommendations
          actions.
