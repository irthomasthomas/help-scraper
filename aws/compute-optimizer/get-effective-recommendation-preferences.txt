OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource for which to  confirm
          effective  recommendation  preferences.  Only  EC2 instance and Auto
          Scaling group ARNs are currently supported.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       enhancedInfrastructureMetrics -> (string)
          The  status  of  the  enhanced infrastructure metrics recommendation
          preference. Considers all applicable preferences that you might have
          set at the resource, account, and organization level.

          A  status  of  Active confirms that the preference is applied in the
          latest recommendation refresh, and a  status  of  Inactive  confirms
          that it's not yet applied to recommendations.

          To validate whether the preference is applied to your last generated
          set of recommendations,  review  the  effectiveRecommendationPrefer-
          ences  value  in the response of the  GetAutoScalingGroupRecommenda-
          tions and  GetEC2InstanceRecommendations actions.

          For more information, see Enhanced  infrastructure  metrics  in  the
          Compute Optimizer User Guide .
