UPDATE-CONNECTIVITY-INFO()                          UPDATE-CONNECTIVITY-INFO()



NAME
       update-connectivity-info -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the connectivity information for the core. Any devices that be-
       long to the group which has this core will receive this information  in
       order to find the location of the core and connect to it.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-connectivity-info
          [--connectivity-info <value>]
          --thing-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --connectivity-info (list) A list of connectivity info.(structure)
          Information about a Greengrass core's connectivity.

          HostAddress -> (string)
              The  endpoint  for  the Greengrass core. Can be an IP address or
              DNS.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID of the connectivity information.

          Metadata -> (string)
              Metadata for this endpoint.

          PortNumber -> (integer)
              The port of the Greengrass core. Usually 8883.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          HostAddress=string,Id=string,Metadata=string,PortNumber=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "HostAddress": "string",
              "Id": "string",
              "Metadata": "string",
              "PortNumber": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --thing-name (string) The thing name.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update the connectivity information for a Greengrass core

       The following update-connectivity-info example  changes  the  endpoints
       that  devices can use to connect to the specified Greengrass core. Con-
       nectivity information is a list of IP addresses or domain  names,  with
       corresponding  port numbers and optional customer-defined metadata. You
       might need to update connectivity information when  the  local  network
       changes.

          aws greengrass update-connectivity-info \
              --thing-name "MyGroup_Core" \
              --connectivity-info "[{\"Metadata\":\"\",\"PortNumber\":8883,\"HostAddress\":\"127.0.0.1\",\"Id\":\"localhost_127.0.0.1_0\"},{\"Metadata\":\"\",\"PortNumber\":8883,\"HostAddress\":\"192.168.1.3\",\"Id\":\"localIP_192.168.1.3\"}]"

       Output:

          {
              "Version": "312de337-59af-4cf9-a278-2a23bd39c300"
          }

OUTPUT
       Message -> (string)
          A message about the connectivity info update request.

       Version -> (string)
          The new version of the connectivity info.
