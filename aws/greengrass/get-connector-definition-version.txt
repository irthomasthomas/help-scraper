GET-CONNECTOR-DEFINITION-VERSION()          GET-CONNECTOR-DEFINITION-VERSION()



NAME
       get-connector-definition-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about a connector definition version, including
       the connectors that the version contains. Connectors are prebuilt  mod-
       ules  that  interact  with local infrastructure, device protocols, AWS,
       and other cloud services.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

            get-connector-definition-version
          --connector-definition-id <value>
          --connector-definition-version-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]

OPTIONS
       --connector-definition-id (string) The ID of the connector definition.

       --connector-definition-version-id (string) The ID of the connector def-
       inition  version.  This  value  maps to the ''Version'' property of the
       corresponding  ''VersionInformation''  object,  which  is  returned  by
       ''ListConnectorDefinitionVersions''  requests.  If  the  version is the
       last one that was associated with a  connector  definition,  the  value
       also maps to the ''LatestVersion'' property of the corresponding ''Def-
       initionInformation'' object.

       --next-token (string) The  token  for  the  next  set  of  results,  or
       ''null'' if there are no additional results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retreive information about a specific version of a connector defini-
       tion

       The following get-connector-definition-version example retrieves infor-
       mation about the specified version of the specified  connector  defini-
       tion.  To retrieve the IDs of all versions of the connector definition,
       use the list-connector-definition-versions command. To retrieve the  ID
       of the last version added to the connector definition, use the get-con-
       nector-definition command and check the LatestVersion property.
