CREATE-RESOURCE-DEFINITION()                      CREATE-RESOURCE-DEFINITION()



NAME
       create-resource-definition -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a resource definition which contains a list of resources to be
       used in a group. You can create an initial version of the definition by
       providing  a  list of resources now, or use ''CreateResourceDefinition-
       Version'' later.

       --amzn-client-token (string) A client token used to correlate  requests
       and responses.

       --initial-version  (structure) Information about the initial version of
       the resource definition.Resources -> (list)
          A list of resources.

              Information about a resource.

              Id -> (string)
                 The resource ID, used to refer to a resource  in  the  Lambda

                 pattern ''[a-zA-Z0-9:_-]+''. This must  be  unique  within  a
                 Greengrass group.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  descriptive resource name, which is displayed on the AWS
                 IoT Greengrass console. Max length 128 characters  with  pat-
                 tern ''[a-zA-Z0-9:_-]+''. This must be unique within a Green-

                 LocalDeviceResourceData -> (structure)
                     Attributes that define the local device resource.

                     GroupOwnerSetting -> (structure)

                            If true, AWS IoT Greengrass automatically adds the
                            specified  Linux OS group owner of the resource to
                            the Lambda process  privileges.  Thus  the  Lambda
                            process  will  have the file access permissions of
                            the added Linux group.

                            The name of the Linux OS  group  whose  privileges
                            will be added to the Lambda process. This field is

                        Lambda environment.

                     GroupOwnerSetting -> (structure)
                        Allows  you  to  configure additional group privileges

                            the Lambda process  privileges.  Thus  the  Lambda
                            process  will  have the file access permissions of
                            the added Linux group.

                        GroupOwner -> (string)
                            The name of the Linux OS  group  whose  privileges
                            will be added to the Lambda process. This field is
                            optional.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a resource definition

       The following create-resource-definition  example  creates  a  resource
       definition that contains a list of resources to be used in a Greengrass
       group. In this example, an initial version of the  resource  definition
       is included by providing a list of resources. The list includes one re-
       source for a Twilio authorization token and the ARN for a secret stored
       in  AWS Secrets Manager. You must create the secret before you can cre-
       ate the resource definition.

          aws greengrass create-resource-definition \
              --name MyGreengrassResources \
              --initial-version "{\"Resources\": [{\"Id\": \"TwilioAuthToken\",\"Name\": \"MyTwilioAuthToken\",\"ResourceDataContainer\": {\"SecretsManagerSecretResourceData\": {\"ARN\": \"arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:greengrass-TwilioAuthToken-ntSlp6\"}}}]}"

       Output:

          {
              "Arn": "arn:aws:greengrass:us-west-2:123456789012:/greengrass/definition/resources/c8bb9ebc-c3fd-40a4-9c6a-568d75569d38",
