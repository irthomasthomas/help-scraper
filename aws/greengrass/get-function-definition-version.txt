SYNOPSIS
            get-function-definition-version
          --function-definition-id <value>
          --function-definition-version-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]

OPTIONS
       --function-definition-id (string) The ID of the Lambda function defini-
       tion.

       --function-definition-version-id (string) The ID of the function  defi-
       nition version. This value maps to the ''Version'' property of the cor-
       responding ''VersionInformation'' object, which is returned by  ''List-
       FunctionDefinitionVersions''  requests.  If the version is the last one
       that was associated with a function definition, the value also maps  to
       the  ''LatestVersion'' property of the corresponding ''DefinitionInfor-
       mation'' object.

       --next-token (string) The  token  for  the  next  set  of  results,  or
       ''null'' if there are no additional results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve details about a specific version of a Lambda function

       The  following  get-function-definition-version  retrieves  information
       about  the  specified  version of the specified function definition. To
       retrieve the IDs of all versions of the function  definition,  use  the
       list-function-definition-versions  command.  To  retrieve the ID of the
       last version added  to  the  function  definition,  use  the  get-func-
       tion-definition command and check the LatestVersion property.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The ARN of the function definition version.

       CreationTimestamp -> (string)
          The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the function defini-
          tion version was created.

       Definition -> (structure)
          Information on the definition.

          DefaultConfig -> (structure)
              The default configuration that applies to all  Lambda  functions
              in this function definition version. Individual Lambda functions
              can override these settings.

              Execution -> (structure)
                 Configuration information that specifies how a  Lambda  func-
                 tion runs.

                 IsolationMode -> (string)
                     Specifies  whether  the  Lambda function runs in a Green-
                     grass container (default)  or  without  containerization.
                     Unless  your  scenario requires that you run without con-
                     tainerization, we recommend that you run in a  Greengrass
                     container.  Omit  this  value  to run the Lambda function
                     with the default containerization for the group.

                 RunAs -> (structure)
                     Specifies the user and group whose permissions  are  used
                     when  running the Lambda function. You can specify one or
                     both values to override the default values. We  recommend
                     that  you  avoid running as root unless absolutely neces-
                     sary to minimize the risk of unintended changes or  mali-
                     cious  attacks. To run as root, you must set ''Isolation-
                     Mode''  to  ''NoContainer''  and  update  config.json  in
                     ''greengrass-root/config''    to   set   ''allowFunction-
                     sToRunAsRoot'' to ''yes''.

                     Gid -> (integer)
                        The group ID whose  permissions  are  used  to  run  a
                        Lambda function.

                     Uid -> (integer)
                        The user ID whose permissions are used to run a Lambda
                        function.

          Functions -> (list)
              A list of Lambda functions in this function definition version.

              (structure)
                 Information about a Lambda function.

                 FunctionArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of the Lambda function.

                 FunctionConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The configuration of the Lambda function.

                     EncodingType -> (string)
                        The expected encoding type of the  input  payload  for
                        the function. The default is ''json''.

                     Environment -> (structure)
                        The environment configuration of the function.

                        AccessSysfs -> (boolean)
                            If  true, the Lambda function is allowed to access
                            the host's /sys folder. Use this when  the  Lambda
                            function  needs  to  read  device information from
                            /sys. This setting applies only when you  run  the
                            Lambda function in a Greengrass container.

                        Execution -> (structure)
                            Configuration  related  to  executing  the  Lambda
                            function

                            IsolationMode -> (string)
                               Specifies whether the Lambda function runs in a
                               Greengrass  container (default) or without con-
                               tainerization. Unless  your  scenario  requires
                               that  you run without containerization, we rec-
                               ommend that you run in a Greengrass  container.
                               Omit this value to run the Lambda function with
                               the default containerization for the group.

                            RunAs -> (structure)
                               Specifies the user and group whose  permissions
                               are  used when running the Lambda function. You
                               can specify one or both values to override  the
                               default  values.  We  recommend  that you avoid
                               running as root unless absolutely necessary  to
                               minimize  the risk of unintended changes or ma-
                               licious attacks. To run as root, you  must  set
                               ''IsolationMode'' to ''NoContainer'' and update
                               config.json  in  ''greengrass-root/config''  to
                               set ''allowFunctionsToRunAsRoot'' to ''yes''.

                               Gid -> (integer)
                                   The  group ID whose permissions are used to
                                   run a Lambda function.

                               Uid -> (integer)
                                   The user ID whose permissions are  used  to
                                   run a Lambda function.

                        ResourceAccessPolicies -> (list)
                            A  list  of the resources, with their permissions,
                            to which the Lambda function will be  granted  ac-
                            cess.  A  Lambda  function can have at most 10 re-
                            sources. ResourceAccessPolicies  apply  only  when
                            you  run  the Lambda function in a Greengrass con-
                            tainer.

                            (structure)
                               A policy used by the function to access  a  re-
                               source.

                               Permission -> (string)
                                   The  permissions  that  the Lambda function
                                   has to the resource. Can be one  of  ''rw''
                                   (read/write) or ''ro'' (read-only).

                               ResourceId -> (string)
                                   The  ID  of  the  resource. (This ID is as-
                                   signed to the resource when you create  the
                                   resource definiton.)

                        Variables -> (map)
                            Environment  variables  for  the Lambda function's
                            configuration.

                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (string)

                     ExecArgs -> (string)
                        The execution arguments.

                     Executable -> (string)
                        The name of the function executable.

                     MemorySize -> (integer)
                        The memory size, in KB, which the  function  requires.
                        This  setting  is not applicable and should be cleared
                        when you run the Lambda function without containeriza-
                        tion.

                     Pinned -> (boolean)
                        True if the function is pinned. Pinned means the func-
                        tion is long-lived and starts when the core starts.

                     Timeout -> (integer)
                        The  allowed  function  execution  time,  after  which
                        Lambda  should  terminate  the  function. This timeout
                        still applies to pinned Lambda functions for each  re-
                        quest.

                     FunctionRuntimeOverride -> (string)
                        The Lambda runtime supported by Greengrass which is to
                        be used instead of the one  specified  in  the  Lambda
                        function.

                 Id -> (string)
                     A  descriptive  or  arbitrary  ID  for the function. This
                     value must be unique within the function definition  ver-
                     sion.   Max   length   is  128  characters  with  pattern
                     ''[a-zA-Z0-9:_-]+''.

       Id -> (string)
          The ID of the function definition version.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results, or ''null'' if there  are  no
          additional results.

       Version -> (string)
          The version of the function definition version.
