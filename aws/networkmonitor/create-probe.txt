NAME
       create-probe -

DESCRIPTION
       Create a probe within a monitor. Once you create a probe, and it begins
       monitoring your network traffic, you'll incur billing charges for  that
       probe.

          destinationPort -> (integer)
              The port associated with the destination . This is required only
              if  the protocol is TCP and must be a number between 1 and 65536
              .

          protocol -> (string)
              The protocol used for the network traffic between the source and
              destination . This must be either TCP or ICMP .

          packetSize -> (integer)
              The size of the packets sent between the source and destination.
              This must be a number between 56 and 8500 .

          tags -> (map)
              The list of key-value pairs created and assigned to the monitor.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          sourceArn=string,destination=string,destinationPort=integer,protocol=string,packetSize=integer,tags={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "sourceArn": "string",
            "destination": "string",
            "destinationPort": integer,
            "protocol": "TCP"|"ICMP",
            "packetSize": integer,
            "tags": {"string": "string"
              ...}
          }

       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier to ensure the idempotency  of  the
          request.  Only  returned  if  a client token was provided in the re-
          quest.

       --tags (map)
          The list of key-value pairs created and assigned to the probe.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
