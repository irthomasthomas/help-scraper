       --instance-arn (string)
          The  ARN of the Amazon Web Services SSO instance under which the op-
          eration will be executed.  For  more  information  about  ARNs,  see
          Amazon  Resource  Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Name-
          spaces in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --session-duration (string)
          The length of time that the application user sessions are  valid  in
          the ISO-8601 standard.

       --relay-state (string)
          Used  to redirect users within the application during the federation
          authentication process.

       --tags (list)
          The tags to attach to the new  PermissionSet .

          (structure)
              A set of key-value pairs that are used to manage  the  resource.
              Tags  can  only  be applied to permission sets and cannot be ap-
              plied to corresponding roles that Amazon Web Services  SSO  cre-
              ates in Amazon Web Services accounts.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
