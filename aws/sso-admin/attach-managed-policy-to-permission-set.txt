ATTACH-MANAGED-POLICY-TO-PERMISSION-SATTACH-MANAGED-POLICY-TO-PERMISSION-SET()



NAME
       attach-managed-policy-to-permission-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Attaches  an Amazon Web Services managed IAM policy ARN to a permission
       set.

       NOTE:
          If the permission set is already referenced by one or  more  account
          assignments, you will need to call ``  ProvisionPermissionSet `` af-
          ter this operation. Calling ProvisionPermissionSet applies the  cor-
          responding IAM policy updates to all assigned accounts.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            attach-managed-policy-to-permission-set
          --instance-arn <value>
          --permission-set-arn <value>
          --managed-policy-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of the SSO instance under which the operation will be exe-
          cuted. For more information about ARNs, see  Amazon  Resource  Names
          (ARNs)  and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces in the Amazon Web
          Services General Reference .

       --permission-set-arn (string)
          The ARN of the  PermissionSet that the managed policy should be  at-
          tached to.

       --managed-policy-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Web Services managed policy ARN to be attached to a per-
          mission set.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
