LIST-APPLICATION-AUTHENTICATION-METHOLIST-APPLICATION-AUTHENTICATION-METHODS()



NAME
       list-application-authentication-methods -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all of the authentication methods supported by the specified ap-
       plication.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-application-authentication-methods uses document type values. Doc-
       ument types follow the JSON data model where valid values are: strings,
       numbers, booleans, null, arrays, and objects. For  command  input,  op-
       tions  and  nested  parameters  that are labeled with the type document
       must be provided as JSON. Shorthand syntax does  not  support  document
       types.

       list-application-authentication-methods  is a paginated operation. Mul-
       tiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data  set
       of  results.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: AuthenticationMethods

OPTIONS
       --application-arn (string)
          Specifies the ARN of the application with the authentication methods
          you want to list.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       AuthenticationMethods -> (list)
          An array list of authentication methods for the  specified  applica-
          tion.

          (structure)
              A  structure  that  describes  an  authentication method and its
              type.

              AuthenticationMethod -> (tagged union structure)
                 A structure that describes an authentication method. The con-
                 tents  of this structure is determined by the Authentication-
                 MethodType .

                 NOTE:
                     This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the follow-
                     ing top level keys can be set: Iam.

                 Iam -> (structure)
                     A  structure  that  describes details for IAM authentica-
                     tion.

                     ActorPolicy -> (document)
                        An IAM policy document in JSON.

              AuthenticationMethodType -> (string)
                 The type of authentication that is used by this method.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If present, this value indicates that more output is available  than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to  get  the
          next  part of the output. You should repeat this until the NextToken
          response element comes back as null . This indicates  that  this  is
          the last page of results.
