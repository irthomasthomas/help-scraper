NAME
       delete-instance-access-control-attribute-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Disables  the  attributes-based  access  control (ABAC) feature for the
       specified Amazon Web Services SSO instance and deletes all of  the  at-
       tribute  mappings  that  have  been  configured.  Once deleted, any at-
       tributes that are received from an identity source and any  custom  at-
       tributes  you  have  previously configured will not be passed. For more
       information about ABAC, see Attribute-Based Access Control in the  Ama-
       zon Web Services SSO User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-instance-access-control-attribute-configuration
          --instance-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-arn (string)
          The  ARN of the Amazon Web Services SSO instance under which the op-
          eration will be executed.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
