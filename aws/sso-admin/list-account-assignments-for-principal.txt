LIST-ACCOUNT-ASSIGNMENTS-FOR-PRINCIPALLIST-ACCOUNT-ASSIGNMENTS-FOR-PRINCIPAL()



NAME
       list-account-assignments-for-principal -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a list of the IAM Identity Center associated Amazon Web Ser-
       vices accounts that the principal has access to.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-account-assignments-for-principal is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  ar-
       gument.   When  using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: AccountAssignments

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Specifies an Amazon Web Services account ID number. Results are fil-
          tered to only those that match this ID number.

          AccountId -> (string)
              The ID number of an Amazon Web Services account that filters the
              results in the response.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccountId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AccountId": "string"
          }

       --instance-arn (string)
          Specifies  the  ARN of the instance of IAM Identity Center that con-
          tains the principal.

       --principal-id (string)
          Specifies the principal for which you want to retrieve the  list  of
          account assignments.

       --principal-type (string)
          Specifies the type of the principal.

          Possible values:

          o USER

          o GROUP

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       AccountAssignments -> (list)
          An array list of the account assignments for the principal.

          (structure)
              A structure that describes an assignment of an Amazon  Web  Ser-
              vices  account to a principal and the permissions that principal
              has in the account.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The account ID number of the Amazon Web Services account.

              PermissionSetArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the IAM Identity Center permission set assigned to
                 this principal for this Amazon Web Services account.

              PrincipalId -> (string)
                 The ID of the principal.

              PrincipalType -> (string)
                 The type of the principal.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  present, this value indicates that more output is available than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request  parameter  in a subsequent call to the operation to get the
          next part of the output. You should repeat this until the  NextToken
          response  element  comes  back as null . This indicates that this is
          the last page of results.
