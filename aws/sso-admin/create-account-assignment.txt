CREATE-ACCOUNT-ASSIGNMENT()                        CREATE-ACCOUNT-ASSIGNMENT()



NAME
       create-account-assignment -

DESCRIPTION
       Assigns  access  to a principal for a specified Amazon Web Services ac-
       count using a specified permission set.

       NOTE:
          The term principal here refers to a user or group that is defined in
          Amazon Web Services SSO.

       NOTE:
          As  part of a successful CreateAccountAssignment call, the specified
          permission set will automatically be provisioned to the  account  in
          the  form  of an IAM policy. That policy is attached to the IAM role
          created in Amazon Web Services SSO. If the permission set is  subse-
          quently updated, the corresponding IAM policies attached to roles in
          your accounts will not be updated automatically. In this  case,  you
          must call ``  ProvisionPermissionSet `` to make these updates.

SYNOPSIS
            create-account-assignment
          --instance-arn <value>
          --target-id <value>
          --target-type <value>
          --permission-set-arn <value>
          --principal-type <value>
          --principal-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-arn (string)
          The  ARN of the Amazon Web Services SSO instance under which the op-
          eration will be executed.  For  more  information  about  ARNs,  see
          Amazon  Resource  Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Name-
          spaces in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --target-id (string)
          TargetID is an Amazon Web Services account identifier,  typically  a
          10-12 digit string (For example, 123456789012).

       --target-type (string)
          The entity type for which the assignment will be created.

          Possible values:

          o AWS_ACCOUNT

       --permission-set-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of  the  permission  set that the admin wants to grant the
          principal access to.

       --principal-type (string)
          The entity type for which the assignment will be created.

          Possible values:

          o USER

          o GROUP

       --principal-id (string)
          An identifier for an object in Amazon Web Services SSO,  such  as  a
          user    or    group.    PrincipalIds   are   GUIDs   (For   example,
          f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6). For  more  information  about
          PrincipalIds in Amazon Web Services SSO, see the Amazon Web Services
          SSO Identity Store API Reference .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
