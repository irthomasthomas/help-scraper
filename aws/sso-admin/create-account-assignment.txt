CREATE-ACCOUNT-ASSIGNMENT()                        CREATE-ACCOUNT-ASSIGNMENT()



NAME
       create-account-assignment -

DESCRIPTION
       Assigns  access  to a principal for a specified Amazon Web Services ac-
       count using a specified permission set.

       NOTE:
          The term principal here refers to a user or group that is defined in
          Amazon Web Services SSO.

       NOTE:
          As  part of a successful CreateAccountAssignment call, the specified
          permission set will automatically be provisioned to the  account  in
          the  form  of an IAM policy. That policy is attached to the IAM role
          created in Amazon Web Services SSO. If the permission set is  subse-
          quently updated, the corresponding IAM policies attached to roles in
          your accounts will not be updated automatically. In this  case,  you
          must call ``  ProvisionPermissionSet `` to make these updates.

       NOTE:
          After a successful response, call DescribeAccountAssignmentCreation-
          Status to describe the status of an assignment creation request.

OPTIONS
       --instance-arn (string)
          The ARN of the Amazon Web Services SSO instance under which the  op-
          eration  will  be  executed.  For  more  information about ARNs, see
          Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services  Service  Name-
          spaces in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --target-id (string)
          TargetID  is  an Amazon Web Services account identifier, typically a
          10-12 digit string (For example, 123456789012).

       --target-type (string)
          The entity type for which the assignment will be created.

          Possible values:

          o AWS_ACCOUNT

       --permission-set-arn (string)
          The ARN of the permission set that the  admin  wants  to  grant  the
          principal access to.

       --principal-type (string)
          The entity type for which the assignment will be created.

          Possible values:

          o USER

          o GROUP

       --principal-id (string)
          An  identifier  for  an object in Amazon Web Services SSO, such as a
          user   or   group.   PrincipalIds   are    GUIDs    (For    example,
          f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6).  For  more  information about
          PrincipalIds in Amazon Web Services SSO, see the Amazon Web Services
          SSO Identity Store API Reference .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
