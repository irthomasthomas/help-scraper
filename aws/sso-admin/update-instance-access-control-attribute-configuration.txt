UPDATE-INSTANCE-ACCESSUPDATE-INSTANCE-ACCESS-CONTROL-ATTRIBUTE-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       update-instance-access-control-attribute-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the Amazon Web Services SSO identity store attributes that you
       can use with the Amazon Web Services SSO instance for  attributes-based
       access  control  (ABAC). When using an external identity provider as an
       identity source, you can pass attributes through the SAML assertion  as
       an  alternative  to configuring attributes from the Amazon Web Services
       SSO identity store. If a SAML assertion passes any of these attributes,
       Amazon  Web  Services  SSO  replaces the attribute value with the value
       from the Amazon Web Services SSO identity store. For  more  information
       about  ABAC,  see Attribute-Based Access Control in the Amazon Web Ser-
       vices SSO User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-instance-access-control-attribute-configuration
          --instance-arn <value>
          --instance-access-control-attribute-configuration <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-arn (string)
          The ARN of the Amazon Web Services SSO instance under which the  op-
          eration will be executed.

       --instance-access-control-attribute-configuration (structure)
          Updates the attributes for your ABAC configuration.

          AccessControlAttributes -> (list)
              Lists  the attributes that are configured for ABAC in the speci-
              fied Amazon Web Services SSO instance.

              (structure)
                 These are Amazon Web Services SSO identity  store  attributes
                 that  you  can  configure  for use in attributes-based access
                 control (ABAC). You can create permissions policies that  de-
                 termine  who  can  access  your Amazon Web Services resources
                 based upon the configured attribute values. When  you  enable
                 ABAC  and  specify  AccessControlAttributes , Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices SSO passes the attribute values  of  the  authenticated
                 user into IAM for use in policy evaluation.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name of the attribute associated with your identities
                     in your identity source. This is used to map a  specified
                     attribute  in  your  identity source with an attribute in
                     Amazon Web Services SSO.

                 Value -> (structure)
                     The value used for mapping a specified  attribute  to  an
                     identity source.

                     Source -> (list)
                        The  identity  source  to use when mapping a specified
                        attribute to Amazon Web Services SSO.

                        (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AccessControlAttributes": [
              {
                "Key": "string",
                "Value": {
                  "Source": ["string", ...]
                }
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
