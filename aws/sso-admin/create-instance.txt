CREATE-INSTANCE()                                            CREATE-INSTANCE()



NAME
       create-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an instance of IAM Identity Center for a standalone Amazon Web
       Services account that is not managed by Organizations or a member  Ama-
       zon  Web  Services  account in an organization. You can create only one
       instance per account and across all Amazon Web Services Regions.

       The CreateInstance request is rejected if the following apply:

       o The instance is created within the organization management account.

       o An instance already exists in the same account.

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Specifies a unique, case-sensitive ID that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency  of  the request. This lets you safely retry the request
          without accidentally performing the same operation  a  second  time.
          Passing the same value to a later call to an operation requires that
          you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We  recommend
          that you use a UUID type of value .

          If  you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates
          a random one for you.

          If you retry the operation with the same ClientToken , but with dif-
          ferent  parameters,  the retry fails with an IdempotentParameterMis-
          match error.

       --name (string)
          The name of the instance of IAM Identity Center.

       --tags (list)
          Specifies tags to be attached to the instance of IAM  Identity  Cen-
          ter.

          (structure)
              A  set  of key-value pairs that are used to manage the resource.
              Tags can only be applied to permission sets and  cannot  be  ap-
              plied to corresponding roles that IAM Identity Center creates in
              Amazon Web Services accounts.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       InstanceArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the instance of IAM Identity Center under which the oper-
          ation will run.
