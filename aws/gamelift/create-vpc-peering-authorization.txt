NAME
       create-vpc-peering-authorization -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests  authorization  to  create or delete a peer connection between
       the VPC for your Amazon GameLift fleet  and  a  virtual  private  cloud
       (VPC) in your Amazon Web Services account. VPC peering enables the game
       servers on your fleet to communicate directly  with  other  Amazon  Web
       Services   resources.   After   you've   received   authorization,  use
       CreateVpcPeeringConnection to establish  the  peering  connection.  For
       more information, see VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift Fleets .

       You  can  peer  with VPCs that are owned by any Amazon Web Services ac-
       count you have access to, including the account that you use to  manage
       your Amazon GameLift fleets. You cannot peer with VPCs that are in dif-
       ferent Regions.

       To request authorization to create a connection,  call  this  operation
       from the Amazon Web Services account with the VPC that you want to peer
       to your Amazon GameLift fleet. For example, to enable your game servers
       to  retrieve  data  from a DynamoDB table, use the account that manages
       that DynamoDB resource. Identify the following values: (1)  The  ID  of
       the  VPC  that  you want to peer with, and (2) the ID of the Amazon Web
       Services account that you use to manage Amazon GameLift. If successful,
       VPC peering is authorized for the specified VPC.

       To  request  authorization  to delete a connection, call this operation
       from the Amazon Web Services account with the VPC that is  peered  with
       your  Amazon  GameLift fleet. Identify the following values: (1) VPC ID
       that you want to delete the peering connection for, and (2) ID  of  the
       Amazon Web Services account that you use to manage Amazon GameLift.

       The authorization remains valid for 24 hours unless it is canceled. You
       must create or delete the peering connection while the authorization is
       valid.

OPTIONS
       --game-lift-aws-account-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the Amazon Web Services account that you use
          to manage your GameLift fleet. You can find your Account ID  in  the
          Amazon Web Services Management Console under account settings.

       --peer-vpc-id (string)
          A  unique identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed by your
          GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same Region as your fleet. To
          look  up  a VPC ID, use the VPC Dashboard in the Amazon Web Services
          Management Console. Learn more about VPC peering in VPC Peering with
          GameLift Fleets .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)
