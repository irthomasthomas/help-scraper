OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The unique identifier for the container group definition to retrieve
          properties for. You can use either the Name or ARN value.

       --version-number (integer)
          The specific version to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ContainerGroupDefinition -> (structure)
          The properties of the requested container group definition resource.

          ContainerGroupDefinitionArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned  to  an  Amazon
              GameLift  ContainerGroupDefinition resource. It uniquely identi-
              fies the resource across all Amazon Web Services Regions. Format
              is     arn:aws:gamelift:[region]::containergroupdefinition/[con-
              tainer group definition name]:[version] .

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A time stamp indicating when this data object was created.  For-
              mat  is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          OperatingSystem -> (string)
              The platform that all containers in the container group  defini-
              tion run on.

              NOTE:
                 Amazon  Linux 2 (AL2) will reach end of support on 6/30/2025.
                 See more details in the  Amazon  Linux  2  FAQs  .  For  game
                 servers that are hosted on AL2 and use Amazon GameLift server
                 SDK 4.x, first update the game server  build  to  server  SDK
                 5.x, and then deploy to AL2023 instances. See Migrate to Ama-
                 zon GameLift server SDK version 5.

          Name -> (string)
              A descriptive identifier for the container group definition. The
              name value is unique in an Amazon Web Services Region.

          ContainerGroupType -> (string)
              The type of container group. Container group type determines how
              Amazon GameLift deploys the container group on  each  fleet  in-
              stance.

          TotalMemoryLimitMebibytes -> (integer)
              The  amount  of  memory (in MiB) on a fleet instance to allocate
              for the container group. All containers in the group share these
              resources.

              You  can set a limit for each container definition in the group.
              If individual containers have limits, this total value  must  be
              greater than any individual container's memory limit.

          TotalVcpuLimit -> (double)
              The amount of vCPU units on a fleet instance to allocate for the
              container group (1 vCPU is equal to 1024 CPU  units).  All  con-
              tainers  in the group share these resources. You can set a limit
              for each container definition in the group. If  individual  con-
              tainers  have  limits,  this  total  value  must  be equal to or
              greater than the sum of the limits for  each  container  in  the
              group.

          GameServerContainerDefinition -> (structure)
              The definition for the game server container in this group. This
              property  is  used  only  when  the  container  group  type   is
              GAME_SERVER  .  This  container definition specifies a container
              image with the game server build.

              ContainerName -> (string)
                 The container  definition  identifier.  Container  names  are
                 unique within a container group definition.

              DependsOn -> (list)
                 Indicates  that  the  container relies on the status of other
                 containers in the same container  group  during  startup  and
                 shutdown  sequences.  A  container might have dependencies on
                 multiple containers.

                 (structure)
                     A container's dependency on another container in the same
                     container group. The dependency impacts how the dependent
                     container is able to start or shut down based the  status
                     of the other container.

                     For  example, ContainerA is configured with the following
                     dependency: a START dependency on ContainerB . This means
                     that ContainerA can't start until ContainerB has started.
                     It also means that ContainerA must shut down before  Con-
                     tainerB .

                     ContainerName -> (string)
                        A descriptive label for the container definition  that
                        this container depends on.

                     Condition -> (string)
                        The condition that the dependency container must reach
                        before the dependent container can start. Valid condi-
                        tions include:

                        o START - The dependency container must have started.

                        o COMPLETE  - The dependency container has run to com-
                          pletion (exits). Use this condition  with  nonessen-
                          tial containers, such as those that run a script and
                          then exit. The dependency container can't be an  es-
                          sential container.

                        o SUCCESS  -  The dependency container has run to com-
                          pletion and exited with a zero  status.  The  depen-
                          dency container can't be an essential container.

                        o HEALTHY  -  The  dependency container has passed its
                          Docker health check. Use this condition with  depen-
                          dency containers that have health checks configured.
                          This  condition  is  confirmed  at  container  group
                          startup only.

              MountPoints -> (list)
                 A  mount  point  that  binds a path inside the container to a
                 file or directory on the host system and lets it  access  the
                 file or directory.

                 (structure)
                     A  mount point that binds a container to a file or direc-
                     tory on the host system.

                     InstancePath -> (string)
                        The path to the source file or directory.

                     ContainerPath -> (string)
                        The mount path on  the  container.  If  this  property
                        isn't set, the instance path is used.

                     AccessLevel -> (string)
                        The type of access for the container.

              EnvironmentOverride -> (list)
                 A set of environment variables that's passed to the container
                 on startup. See the ContainerDefinition::environment  parame-
                 ter in the Amazon Elastic Container Service API Reference .

                 (structure)
                     An environment variable to set inside a container, in the
                     form of a key-value pair.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The environment variable name.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The environment variable value.

              ImageUri -> (string)
                 The URI to the image that Amazon GameLift uses when deploying
                 this  container  to  a  container  fleet. For a more specific
                 identifier, see ResolvedImageDigest .

              PortConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The set of ports that are available to bind to  processes  in
                 the  container. For example, a game server process requires a
                 container port to allow game clients to connect to  it.  Con-
                 tainer  ports  aren't  directly  accessed by inbound traffic.
                 Amazon GameLift maps these container ports to externally  ac-
                 cessible  connection ports, which are assigned as needed from
                 the container fleet's ConnectionPortRange .

                 ContainerPortRanges -> (list)
                     A set of one or more container port  number  ranges.  The
                     ranges can't overlap.

                     (structure)
                        A  set  of one or more port numbers that can be opened
                        on the container.

                        FromPort -> (integer)
                            A starting value for the  range  of  allowed  port
                            numbers.

                        ToPort -> (integer)
                            An ending value for the range of allowed port num-
                            bers. Port numbers are end-inclusive.  This  value
                            must be equal to or greater than FromPort .

                        Protocol -> (string)
                            The network protocol that these ports support.

              ResolvedImageDigest -> (string)
                 A  unique  and  immutable identifier for the container image.
                 The digest is a SHA 256 hash of the container image manifest.

              ServerSdkVersion -> (string)
                 The Amazon GameLift server SDK version that the  game  server
                 is  integrated  with. Only game servers using 5.2.0 or higher
                 are compatible with container fleets.

          SupportContainerDefinitions -> (list)
              The set of definitions for support containers in this  group.  A
              container  group  definition  might  have zero support container
              definitions. Support container can be used in any type  of  con-
              tainer group.

              (structure)
                 Describes a support container in a container group. A support
                 container might be in a game  server  container  group  or  a
                 per-instance  container  group.  Support containers don't run
                 game server processes.

                 You can update a support container definition and deploy  the
                 updates  to  an  existing  fleet. When creating or updating a
                 game server container  group  definition,  use  the  property
                 GameServerContainerDefinitionInput .

                 ContainerName -> (string)
                     The  container definition identifier. Container names are
                     unique within a container group definition.

                 DependsOn -> (list)
                     Indicates that the container  relies  on  the  status  of
                     other  containers  in the same container group during its
                     startup and shutdown sequences. A  container  might  have
                     dependencies on multiple containers.

                     (structure)
                        A  container's  dependency on another container in the
                        same container group. The dependency impacts  how  the
                        dependent  container  is  able  to  start or shut down
                        based the status of the other container.

                        For example, ContainerA is configured with the follow-
                        ing  dependency:  a  START  dependency on ContainerB .
                        This means that  ContainerA  can't  start  until  Con-
                        tainerB  has  started.  It  also means that ContainerA
                        must shut down before ContainerB .

                              nonessential  containers, such as those that run
                              a script and then exit. The dependency container
                              can't be an essential container.

                            o SUCCESS  -  The  dependency container has run to
                              completion and exited with a  zero  status.  The
                              dependency  container can't be an essential con-
                              tainer.

                            o HEALTHY - The dependency  container  has  passed
                              its Docker health check. Use this condition with
                              dependency containers that  have  health  checks
                              configured.  This condition is confirmed at con-
                              tainer group startup only.

                 MountPoints -> (list)
                     A mount point that binds a path inside the container to a
                     file  or  directory on the host system and lets it access
                     the file or directory.

                     (structure)
                        A mount point that binds a container to a file or  di-
                        rectory on the host system.

                            The  mount path on the container. If this property
                            isn't set, the instance path is used.

                        AccessLevel -> (string)
                            The type of access for the container.

                 EnvironmentOverride -> (list)
                     A set of environment variables that's passed to the  con-
                     tainer         on         startup.         See        the
                     ContainerDefinition::environment parameter in the  Amazon
                     Elastic Container Service API Reference .

                     (structure)
                        An  environment variable to set inside a container, in
                        the form of a key-value pair.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The environment variable value.

                 Essential -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether the container is vital to the container
                     group.  If  an essential container fails, the entire con-
                     tainer group restarts.

                 HealthCheck -> (structure)
                     A configuration for a non-terminal health check.  A  sup-
                     port  container  automatically restarts if it stops func-
                     tioning or if it fails this health check.

                     Command -> (list)
                        A string array that specifies  the  command  that  the
                        container runs to determine if it's healthy.

                        (string)

                     Interval -> (integer)
                        The  time  period  (in  seconds)  between  each health
                        check.

                     Retries -> (integer)
                        The number of times to retry a failed health check be-
                        fore  flagging  the container unhealthy. The first run
                        of the command does not count as a retry.

                     StartPeriod -> (integer)
                        The optional grace period (in seconds) to give a  con-
                        tainer  time  to  bootstrap  before  the  first failed
                        health check counts toward the number of retries.

                     Timeout -> (integer)
                        The time period (in seconds)  to  wait  for  a  health
                        check  to  succeed  before  counting  a  failed health
                        check.

                 ImageUri -> (string)
                     The URI to the image that Amazon GameLift  deploys  to  a
                     container  fleet. For a more specific identifier, see Re-
                     solvedImageDigest .

                 MemoryHardLimitMebibytes -> (integer)
                     The amount of memory that Amazon GameLift makes available
                     to  the container. If memory limits aren't set for an in-
                     dividual container, the container  shares  the  container
                     group's total memory allocation.

                 PortConfiguration -> (structure)
                     A set of ports that allow access to  the  container  from
                     external  users.  Processes  running in the container can
                     bind to a one of these ports. Container ports aren't  di-
                     rectly  accessed by inbound traffic. Amazon GameLift maps
                     these container ports to externally accessible connection
                     ports,  which  are  assigned as needed from the container
                     fleet's ConnectionPortRange .

                     ContainerPortRanges -> (list)
                        A set of one or more container port number ranges. The
                        ranges can't overlap.

                        (structure)
                            A  set  of  one  or  more port numbers that can be
                            opened on the container.

                            FromPort -> (integer)
                               A starting value for the range of allowed  port
                               numbers.

                            ToPort -> (integer)
                               An  ending  value for the range of allowed port
                               numbers. Port numbers are  end-inclusive.  This
                               value must be equal to or greater than FromPort
                               .

                            Protocol -> (string)
                               The network protocol that these ports support.

                 ResolvedImageDigest -> (string)
                     A unique and immutable identifier for the  container  im-
                     age.  The digest is a SHA 256 hash of the container image
                     manifest.

                 Vcpu -> (double)
                     The number of vCPU units that are reserved for  the  con-
                     tainer.  If  no  resources  are  reserved,  the container
                     shares the total vCPU limit for the container group.

          VersionNumber -> (integer)
              Indicates  the  version  of a particular container group defini-
              tion. This number is incremented automatically when you update a
              container  group definition. You can view, update, or delete in-
              dividual versions or the entire container group definition.

          VersionDescription -> (string)
              An optional description that was provided for a container  group
              definition update. Each version can have a unique description.

          Status -> (string)
              Current  status of the container group definition resource. Val-
              ues include:

              o COPYING -- Amazon GameLift is in the process of making  copies
                of  all  container images that are defined in the group. While
                in this state, the resource can't be used  to  create  a  con-
                tainer fleet.

              o READY  --  Amazon  GameLift has copied the registry images for
                all containers that are defined in the group. You  can  use  a
                container  group  definition  in  this status to create a con-
                tainer fleet.

              o FAILED -- Amazon GameLift failed to create a  valid  container
                group  definition  resource.  For more details on the cause of
                the failure, see StatusReason . A container  group  definition
                resource  in  failed  status will be deleted within a few min-
                utes.

          StatusReason -> (string)
              Additional information about a container group definition that's
              in FAILED status. Possible reasons include:

              o An  internal issue prevented Amazon GameLift from creating the
                container group definition resource.  Delete  the  failed  re-
                source and call  CreateContainerGroupDefinition again.

              o An access-denied message means that you don't have permissions
                to access the container image on ECR. See IAM permission exam-
                ples  for  help setting up required IAM permissions for Amazon
                GameLift.

              o The ImageUri value for at least one of the containers  in  the
                container  group  definition  was  invalid or not found in the
                current Amazon Web Services account.

              o At least one of the container images referenced  in  the  con-
                tainer  group  definition  exceeds  the allowed size. For size
                limits, see Amazon GameLift endpoints and quotas .

              o At least one of the container images referenced  in  the  con-
                tainer group definition uses a different operating system than
                the one defined for the container group.
