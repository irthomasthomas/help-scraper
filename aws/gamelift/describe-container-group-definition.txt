OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The unique identifier for the container group definition to retrieve
          properties for. You can use either the Name or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ContainerGroupDefinition -> (structure)
          The properties of the requested container group definition resource.

          ContainerGroupDefinitionArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN ) that is assigned to an Amazon
              GameLift ContainerGroupDefinition resource. It uniquely  identi-
              fies the resource across all Amazon Web Services Regions. Format
              is     arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::containergroupdefinition/[con-
              tainer group definition name] .

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A  time stamp indicating when this data object was created. For-
              mat is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for  ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          OperatingSystem -> (string)
              The  platform required for all containers in the container group
              definition.

              NOTE:
                 Amazon Linux 2 (AL2) will reach end of support on  6/30/2025.
                 See  more  details  in  the  Amazon  Linux  2 FAQs . For game
                 servers that are hosted on AL2 and use Amazon GameLift server
                 SDK  4.x.,  first  update the game server build to server SDK
                 5.x, and then deploy to AL2023 instances. See Migrate to Ama-
                 zon GameLift server SDK version 5.

          Name -> (string)
              A descriptive identifier for the container group definition. The
              name value is unique in an Amazon Web Services Region.

          SchedulingStrategy -> (string)
              The method for deploying the container group  across  fleet  in-
              stances. A replica container group might have multiple copies on
              each fleet instance. A daemon container group maintains only one
              copy per fleet instance.

          TotalMemoryLimit -> (integer)
              The  amount  of  memory (in MiB) on a fleet instance to allocate
              for the container group. All containers in the group share these
              resources.

              You  can  set additional limits for each  ContainerDefinition in
              the group. If individual containers have limits, this value must
              meet the following requirements:

              o Equal  to  or  greater  than the sum of all container-specific
                soft memory limits in the group.

              o Equal to or greater than any container-specific hard limits in
                the group.

              For  more  details on memory allocation, see the Container fleet
              design guide .

          TotalCpuLimit -> (integer)
              The amount of CPU units on a fleet instance to allocate for  the
              container  group.  All  containers  in the group share these re-
              sources. This property is an integer value in CPU units (1  vCPU
              is equal to 1024 CPU units).

              You  can  set additional limits for each  ContainerDefinition in
              the group. If individual containers have limits, this value must
              be  equal  to  or greater than the sum of all container-specific
              CPU limits in the group.

              For more details on memory allocation, see the  Container  fleet
              design guide .

          ContainerDefinitions -> (list)
              The  set  of container definitions that are included in the con-
              tainer group.

              (structure)
                     This data type is used with the Amazon GameLift  contain-
                     ers feature, which is currently in public preview.

                 Describes  a  container  in  a container fleet, the resources
                 available to the container, and the  commands  that  are  run
                 when  the container starts. Container properties can't be up-
                 dated. To change a property, create  a  new  container  group
                 definition. See also  ContainerDefinitionInput .

                     ContainerGroupDefinitions

                 ContainerName -> (string)
                     The container definition identifier. Container names  are
                     unique within a container group definition.

                 ImageUri -> (string)
                     The  URI to the image that $short; copied and deployed to
                     a container fleet. For a more  specific  identifier,  see
                     ResolvedImageDigest .

                 ResolvedImageDigest -> (string)
                     A unique and immutable identifier for the container image
                     that is deployed to a container fleet. The  digest  is  a
                     SHA 256 hash of the container image manifest.

                 MemoryLimits -> (structure)
                     The amount of memory that Amazon GameLift makes available
                     to the container. If memory limits aren't set for an  in-
                     dividual  container,  the  container shares the container
                     group's total memory allocation.

                        talMemoryLimit

                     SoftLimit -> (integer)
                        The amount of memory that is reserved for a container.
                        When the container group's shared memory is under con-
                        tention, the system attempts to maintain the container
                        memory usage at this soft  limit.  However,  the  con-
                        tainer  can use more memory when needed, if available.
                        This property is similar to the Amazon  ECS  container
                        definition parameter memoryreservation (Amazon Elastic
                        Container Service Developer Guide ).

                     HardLimit -> (integer)
                        The maximum amount of memory that  the  container  can
                        use. If a container attempts to exceed this limit, the
                        container is stopped. This property is similar to  the
                        Amazon  ECS  container  definition parameter memory in
                        the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.

                 PortConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Defines the ports that are available to  assign  to  pro-
                     cesses  in  the  container.  For  example,  a game server
                     process requires a container port to allow  game  clients
                     to  connect  to  it.  Container ports aren't directly ac-
                     cessed by inbound traffic.  Amazon  GameLift  maps  these
                     container   ports  to  externally  accessible  connection
                     ports, which are assigned as needed  from  the  container
                     fleet's ConnectionPortRange .

                     ContainerPortRanges -> (list)
                        Specifies  one or more ranges of ports on a container.
                        These ranges must not overlap.

                               lic preview.

                            A set of one or more  port  numbers  that  can  be
                            opened on the container.

                            FromPort -> (integer)
                               A  starting value for the range of allowed port
                               numbers.

                            ToPort -> (integer)
                               An ending value for the range of  allowed  port
                               numbers.  Port  numbers are end-inclusive. This
                               value must be equal to or greater than FromPort
                               .

                            Protocol -> (string)
                               The network protocol that these ports support.

                 Cpu -> (integer)
                     The  number  of  CPU units that are reserved for the con-
                     tainer. Note: 1 vCPU unit equals 1024 CPU  units.  If  no
                     resources  are  reserved,  the container shares the total
                     CPU limit for the container group.

                 HealthCheck -> (structure)
                     A  configuration  for a non-terminal health check. A con-
                     tainer, which automatically restarts if  it  stops  func-
                     tioning,  also restarts if it fails this health check. If
                     an essential container in the daemon group fails a health
                     check,  the  entire container group is restarted. The es-
                     sential container in the replica group doesn't  use  this
                     health check mechanism, because the Amazon GameLift Agent
                     automatically handles the task.

                     Command -> (list)
                        A string array that specifies  the  command  that  the
                        container runs to determine if it's healthy.

                        (string)

                     Interval -> (integer)
                        The  time  period  (in  seconds)  between  each health
                        check.

                     Timeout -> (integer)
                        The time period (in seconds)  to  wait  for  a  health
                        check  to  succeed  before  a  failed  health check is
                        counted.

                     Retries -> (integer)
                        The number of times to retry a failed health check be-
                        fore  the container is considered unhealthy. The first
                        run of the command does not count as a retry.

                     StartPeriod -> (integer)
                        The optional grace period (in seconds) to give a  con-
                        tainer  time  to  bootstrap  before  the  first failed
                        health check counts toward the number of retries.

                 Command -> (list)
                     A command that's passed to the container on startup. Each
                     argument  for  the command is an additional string in the
                     array. See the ContainerDefinition::command parameter  in
                     the Amazon Elastic Container Service API reference.

                     (string)

                 Essential -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether the container is vital to the container
                     group. If an essential container fails, the  entire  con-
                     tainer group is restarted.

                 EntryPoint -> (list)
                     The  entry  point  that's  passed  to  the  container  on
                     startup. If there are multiple arguments,  each  argument
                     is   an   additional   string   in  the  array.  See  the
                     ContainerDefinition::entryPoint parameter in  the  Amazon
                     Elastic Container Service API Reference .

                     (string)

                 WorkingDirectory -> (string)
                     The  directory  in  the container where commands are run.

                     in the Amazon Elastic Container Service API Reference .

                 Environment -> (list)
                     A  set of environment variables that's passed to the con-
                     tainer        on         startup.         See         the

                 DependsOn -> (list)
                     Indicates that the container  relies  on  the  status  of
                     other  containers  in the same container group during its
                     startup and shutdown sequences. A  container  might  have
                     dependencies on multiple containers.

                        A  container's  dependency on another container in the
                        same container group. The dependency impacts  how  the
                        dependent  container  is  able  to  start or shut down
                        based the status of the other container.

                        For example, ContainerA is configured with the follow-
                        ing dependency: a START dependency on ContainerB. This
                        means that ContainerA can't start until ContainerB has
                        started.  It also means that ContainerA must shut down
                        before ContainerB.

                        ContainerName -> (string)
                            A descriptive label for the  container  definition
                            that this container depends on.

                        Condition -> (string)
                            The  condition  that the dependency container must
                            reach before the dependent  container  can  start.
                            Valid conditions include:

                            o START  -  The  dependency  container  must  have
                              started.

                            o COMPLETE - The dependency container has  run  to
                              completion  (exits).  Use  this  condition  with
                              nonessential containers, such as those that  run
                              a script and then exit. The dependency container
                              can't be an essential container.

                            o SUCCESS - The dependency container  has  run  to
                              completion  and  exited  with a zero status. The
                              dependency container can't be an essential  con-
                              tainer.

                            o HEALTHY  -  The  dependency container has passed
                              its Docker health check. Use this condition with
                              dependency  containers  that  have health checks
                              configured. This condition is confirmed at  con-
                              tainer group startup only.

          Status -> (string)
              Current  status of the container group definition resource. Val-
              ues include:

              o COPYING -- Amazon GameLift is in the process of making  copies
                of  all  container images that are defined in the group. While
                in this state, the resource can't be used  to  create  a  con-
                tainer fleet.

              o READY  --  Amazon  GameLift has copied the registry images for
                all containers that are defined in the group. You  can  use  a
                container  group  definition  in  this status to create a con-
                tainer fleet.

              o FAILED -- Amazon GameLift failed to create a  valid  container
                group  definition  resource.  For more details on the cause of
                the failure, see StatusReason . A container  group  definition
                resource  in  failed  status will be deleted within a few min-
                utes.

          StatusReason -> (string)
              Additional information about a container group definition that's
              in FAILED status. Possible reasons include:

              o An  internal issue prevented Amazon GameLift from creating the
                container group definition resource.  Delete  the  failed  re-
                source and call  CreateContainerGroupDefinition again.

              o An access-denied message means that you don't have permissions
                to access the container image on ECR. See IAM permission exam-
                ples  for  help setting up required IAM permissions for Amazon
                GameLift.

              o The ImageUri value for at least one of the containers  in  the
                container  group  definition  was  invalid or not found in the
                current Amazon Web Services account.

              o At least one of the container images referenced  in  the  con-
                tainer  group  definition  exceeds  the allowed size. For size
                limits, see Amazon GameLift endpoints and quotas .

              o At least one of the container images referenced  in  the  con-
                tainer group definition uses a different operating system than
                the one defined for the container group.
