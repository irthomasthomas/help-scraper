NAME
       describe-fleet-location-utilization -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  current  usage  data  for a fleet location. Utilization data
       provides a snapshot of current game hosting activity at  the  requested
       location.  Use this operation to retrieve utilization information for a
       fleet's remote location or home Region (you can also retrieve home  Re-
       gion utilization by calling DescribeFleetUtilization ).

       To retrieve utilization data, identify a fleet and location.

       If  successful, a FleetUtilization object is returned for the requested
       fleet location.

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to  request  location  utilization
          for. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --location (string)
          The  fleet location to retrieve utilization information for. Specify
          a location in the form of an Amazon Web Services Region  code,  such
          as us-west-2 .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       FleetUtilization -> (structure)
          Utilization  information  for the requested fleet location. Utiliza-
          tion objects are returned only for fleets and  locations  that  cur-
          rently exist.

          FleetId -> (string)

              GameLift fleet resource and uniquely  identifies  it.  ARNs  are
              unique  across  all  Regions.  Format  is  arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
              gion>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .

          ActiveServerProcessCount -> (integer)
              The number of server processes in ACTIVE status  that  are  cur-
              rently running across all instances in the fleet location.

          ActiveGameSessionCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  active  game  sessions that are currently being
              hosted across all instances in the fleet location.

          CurrentPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)
              The number of active player sessions that  are  currently  being

              that are currently being hosted  across  all  instances  in  the

              The  fleet  location  for the fleet utilization information, ex-
              pressed as an Amazon Web Services Region code, such as us-west-2
              .
