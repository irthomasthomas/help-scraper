OPTIONS
       --script-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the Realtime script to  retrieve  properties
          for. You can use either the script ID or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Script -> (structure)
          A set of properties describing the requested script.

          ScriptId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the Realtime script

          ScriptArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN ) that is assigned to a Amazon
              GameLift script resource and uniquely identifies  it.  ARNs  are
              unique  across  all  Regions.  In a GameLift script ARN, the re-
              source ID matches the ScriptId value.

          Name -> (string)
              A descriptive label that is associated  with  a  script.  Script
              names don't need to be unique.

          Version -> (string)
              Version  information  associated with a build or script. Version
              strings don't need to be unique.

          SizeOnDisk -> (long)
              The file size of the  uploaded  Realtime  script,  expressed  in
              bytes.  When  files are uploaded from an S3 location, this value
              remains at "0".

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A time stamp indicating when this data object was created.  For-
              mat  is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          StorageLocation -> (structure)
              The location of the Amazon S3 bucket where a  zipped  file  con-
              taining  your  Realtime  scripts is stored. The storage location
              must specify the Amazon S3 bucket name, the zip file  name  (the
              "key"), and a role ARN that allows Amazon GameLift to access the
              Amazon S3 storage location. The S3 bucket must be  in  the  same
              Region where you want to create a new script. By default, Amazon
              GameLift uploads the latest version of the zip file; if you have
              S3  object  versioning  turned on, you can use the ObjectVersion
              parameter to specify an earlier version.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 An Amazon S3 bucket identifier. Thename of the S3 bucket.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon GameLift doesn't support uploading from Amazon  S3
                     buckets with names that contain a dot (.).

              Key -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  zip file that contains the build files or
                 script files.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role  that  allows
                 Amazon GameLift to access the S3 bucket.

              ObjectVersion -> (string)
                 The  version  of  the file, if object versioning is turned on
                 for the bucket. Amazon GameLift uses  this  information  when
                 retrieving files from an S3 bucket that you own. Use this pa-
                 rameter to specify a specific version of  the  file.  If  not
                 set, the latest version of the file is retrieved.
