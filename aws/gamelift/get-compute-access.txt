GET-COMPUTE-ACCESS()                                      GET-COMPUTE-ACCESS()



NAME
       get-compute-access -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests  authorization to remotely connect to a compute resource in an
       Amazon GameLift fleet. Call this action to connect to an instance in  a
       managed EC2 fleet if the fleet's game build uses Amazon GameLift server
       SDK 5.x or later. To connect to instances with  game  builds  that  use
       server SDK 4.x or earlier, call  GetInstanceAccess .

       To  request access to a compute, identify the specific EC2 instance and
       the fleet it belongs to. You can retrieve instances for a  managed  EC2
       fleet by calling  ListCompute .

       If  successful,  this  operation  returns a set of temporary Amazon Web
       Services credentials, including a two-part access key and a session to-
       ken.  Use  these  credentials  with Amazon EC2 Systems Manager (SSM) to
       start a session with the compute. For more details, see Starting a ses-
       sion (CLI) in the Amazon EC2 Systems Manager User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that contains the compute resource
          you want to connect to. You can use  either  the  fleet  ID  or  ARN
          value.

       --compute-name (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the compute resource that you want to con-
          nect to. You can use either a registered compute name or an instance
          ID.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
