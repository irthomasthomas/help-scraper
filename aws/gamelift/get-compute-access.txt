GET-COMPUTE-ACCESS()                                      GET-COMPUTE-ACCESS()



NAME
       get-compute-access -

DESCRIPTION
          This  operation  has  been  expanded to use with the Amazon GameLift
          containers feature, which is currently in public preview.

       Requests authorization to remotely connect to a hosting resource  in  a
       Amazon  GameLift  managed fleet. This operation is not used with Amazon
       GameLift Anywhere fleets

       To request access, specify the compute name and the fleet ID.  If  suc-
       cessful,  this operation returns a set of temporary Amazon Web Services
       credentials, including a two-part access key and a session token.
          EC2 fleets

       With an EC2 fleet (where compute type is EC2 ), use  these  credentials
       with  Amazon EC2 Systems Manager (SSM) to start a session with the com-
       pute. For more details, see Starting a session (CLI) in the Amazon  EC2
       Systems Manager User Guide .
          Container fleets

       With  a  container  fleet (where compute type is CONTAINER ), use these
       credentials and the target value with SSM to connect to the  fleet  in-
       stance  where  the  container is running. After you're connected to the
       instance, use Docker commands to interact with the container.

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that holds  the  compute  resource
          that  you want to connect to. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN
          value.

       --compute-name (string)
          A unique identifier for the compute resource that you want  to  con-
          nect  to.  For an EC2 fleet compute, use the instance ID. For a con-
          tainer   fleet,    use    the    compute    name    (for    example,
          a123b456c789012d3e4567f8a901b23c/1a234b56-7cd8-9e0f-a1b2-c34d567ef8a9
          ) or the compute ARN.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

          unique across all Regions. Format is arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::com-
          pute/compute-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .
