GET-COMPUTE-ACCESS()                                      GET-COMPUTE-ACCESS()



NAME
       get-compute-access -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests  authorization  to remotely connect to a hosting resource in a
       Amazon GameLift managed fleet. This operation is not used  with  Amazon
       GameLift Anywhere fleets.
          Request options

       To  request access to a compute, specify the compute name and the fleet
       ID.
          Results

       If successful, this operation returns a set  of  temporary  Amazon  Web
       Services credentials, including a two-part access key and a session to-
       ken.

       o With a managed EC2 fleet (where compute type is EC2 ), use these cre-
         dentials  with  Amazon  EC2  Systems Manager (SSM) to start a session
         with the compute. For more details, see Starting a session  (CLI)  in
         the Amazon EC2 Systems Manager User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for the fleet that holds the compute resource
          that you want to connect to. You can use either the fleet ID or  ARN
          value.

       --compute-name (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the compute resource that you want to con-
          nect to. For an EC2 fleet compute, use the instance ID.  Use   List-
          Compute to retrieve compute identifiers.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

          specific container.

          (structure)
              A unique identifier for a container in a compute  on  a  managed
              container  fleet instance. This information makes it possible to
              remotely connect to a specific container on a fleet instance.
                 Related to:   ContainerAttribute

                 Use with:   GetComputeAccess

              ContainerName -> (string)
