GET-COMPUTE-ACCESS()                                      GET-COMPUTE-ACCESS()



NAME
       get-compute-access -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests remote access to a fleet instance. Remote access is useful for
       debugging, gathering benchmarking data, or observing activity  in  real
       time.

       To remotely access an instance, you need credentials that match the op-
       erating system of the instance. For a Windows  instance,  GameLift  re-
       turns a user name and password as strings for use with a Windows Remote
       Desktop client. For a Linux instance, GameLift returns a user name  and
       RSA  private key, also as strings, for use with an SSH client. The pri-
       vate key must be saved in the proper format to a .pem file  before  us-
       ing. If you're making this request using the CLI, saving the secret can
       be handled as part of the GetInstanceAccess request, as shown in one of
       the examples for this operation.

       To  request  access to a specific instance, specify the IDs of both the
       instance and the fleet it belongs to.

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that the compute resource is  reg-
          istered to.

       --compute-name (string)
          The name of the compute resource you are requesting credentials for.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
