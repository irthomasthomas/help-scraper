DEREGISTER-COMPUTE()                                      DEREGISTER-COMPUTE()



NAME
       deregister-compute -

DESCRIPTION
          This  operation  has  been  expanded to use with the Amazon GameLift
          containers feature, which is currently in public preview.

       Removes a compute resource from an Amazon GameLift  Anywhere  fleet  or
       container fleet. Deregistered computes can no longer host game sessions
       through Amazon GameLift.

       For an Anywhere fleet or a container fleet that's  running  the  Amazon
       GameLift  Agent,  the Agent handles all compute registry tasks for you.
       For an Anywhere fleet that doesn't use the Agent, call  this  operation
       to deregister fleet computes.

       To  deregister  a  compute, call this operation from the compute that's
       being deregistered and specify the compute name and the fleet ID.

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet the compute resource is  currently
          registered to.

       --compute-name (string)
          The  unique identifier of the compute resource to deregister. For an
          Anywhere fleet compute, use the registered compute name. For a  con-
          tainer    fleet,    use    the    compute    name    (for   example,
          a123b456c789012d3e4567f8a901b23c/1a234b56-7cd8-9e0f-a1b2-c34d567ef8a9
          ) or the compute ARN.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       None
