CREATE-FLEET-LOCATIONS()                              CREATE-FLEET-LOCATIONS()



NAME
       create-fleet-locations -

DESCRIPTION
          This  operation  has  been  expanded to use with the Amazon GameLift
          containers feature, which is currently in public preview.

       Adds remote locations to an EC2 or container fleet and begins  populat-
       ing  the new locations with instances. The new instances conform to the
       fleet's instance type, auto-scaling, and other configuration settings.

       NOTE:
          You can't add remote locations to a fleet that resides in an  Amazon
          Web  Services Region that doesn't support multiple locations. Fleets
          created prior to March 2021 can't support multiple locations.

       To add fleet locations, specify the fleet to be updated and  provide  a
       list of one or more locations.

       If  successful, this operation returns the list of added locations with
       their status set to NEW . Amazon  GameLift  initiates  the  process  of
       starting  an  instance in each added location. You can track the status
       of each new location  by  monitoring  location  creation  events  using
       DescribeFleetEvents .

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the fleet to add locations to. You can use
          either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --locations (list)
          A list of locations to deploy additional instances to and manage  as
          part  of the fleet. You can add any Amazon GameLift-supported Amazon
          Web Services Region as a remote location, in the form of  an  Amazon
          Web Services Region code such as us-west-2 .

          (structure)
                 This  data  type  has  been  expanded  to use with the Amazon
                 GameLift containers feature, which  is  currently  in  public
                 preview.

              A  remote  location where a multi-location fleet can deploy game
              servers for game hosting.

              Location -> (string)
                 An Amazon Web Services Region code, such as us-west-2 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Location=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Location": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for the fleet that was updated with new loca-
          tions.

       FleetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN  )  that  is  assigned  to  a  Amazon
          GameLift  fleet resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique
          across    all    Regions.    Format     is     arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
          gion>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .

       LocationStates -> (list)
          The  remote  locations  that  are  being added to the fleet, and the
          life-cycle status of each location. For new locations, the status is
          set  to NEW . During location creation, Amazon GameLift updates each
          location's status as instances are deployed there and  prepared  for
          game  hosting.  This  list does not include the fleet home Region or
          any remote locations that were already added to the fleet.

          (structure)
              A fleet location and its life-cycle state. A location state  ob-
              ject might be used to describe a fleet's remote location or home
              Region. Life-cycle state tracks the progress  of  launching  the
              first instance in a new location and preparing it for game host-
              ing, and then removing all instances and deleting  the  location
              from the fleet.

              o NEW  --  A new fleet location has been defined and desired in-
                stances is set to 1.

              o DOWNLOADING/VALIDATING/BUILDING/ACTIVATING -- Amazon  GameLift
                is  setting  up the new fleet location, creating new instances
                with the game build or Realtime  script  and  starting  server
                processes.

              o ACTIVE -- Hosts can now accept game sessions.

              o ERROR  --  An  error  occurred  when  downloading, validating,
                building, or activating the fleet location.

              o DELETING -- Hosts are responding to a  delete  fleet  location
                request.

              o TERMINATED -- The fleet location no longer exists.

              o NOT_FOUND  --  The fleet location was not found. This could be
                because the custom location was removed or not created.

              Location -> (string)
                 The fleet location, expressed as an Amazon Web  Services  Re-
                 gion code such as us-west-2 .

              Status -> (string)
                 The life-cycle status of a fleet location.
