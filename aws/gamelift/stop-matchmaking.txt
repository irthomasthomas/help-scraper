STOP-MATCHMAKING()                                          STOP-MATCHMAKING()



NAME
       stop-matchmaking -

DESCRIPTION
       Cancels a matchmaking ticket or match backfill ticket that is currently
       being processed. To stop the matchmaking operation, specify the  ticket
       ID. If successful, work on the ticket is stopped, and the ticket status
       is changed to CANCELLED .

       This call is also used to turn off automatic backfill for an individual
       game  session. This is for game sessions that are created with a match-
       making configuration that has automatic backfill enabled. The ticket ID
       is  included  in  the MatchmakerData of an updated game session object,
       which is provided to the game server.

       NOTE:
              If the operation is successful, the service sends back an  empty
              JSON struct with the HTTP 200 response (not an empty HTTP body).

OPTIONS
       --ticket-id (string)
          A unique identifier for a matchmaking ticket.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
