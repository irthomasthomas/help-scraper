LIST-BUILDS()                                                    LIST-BUILDS()



NAME
       list-builds -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves build resources for all builds associated with the Amazon Web
       Services account in use. You can limit results to builds that are in  a
       specific  status  by using the Status parameter. Use the pagination pa-
       rameters to retrieve results in a set of sequential pages.

       NOTE:
              Build resources are not listed in any particular order.

       list-builds is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: Builds

OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          Build  status  to  filter  results by. To retrieve all builds, leave
          this parameter empty.

          Possible build statuses include the following:

          o INITIALIZED -- A new build has been defined,  but  no  files  have
            been  uploaded.  You  cannot  create fleets for builds that are in
            this status. When a build is successfully created, the build  sta-
            tus is set to this value.

          o READY  --  The  game build has been successfully uploaded. You can
            now create new fleets for this build.

          o FAILED -- The game build upload  failed.  You  cannot  create  new
            fleets for this build.

          Possible values:

          o INITIALIZED

          o READY

          o FAILED

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example1: To get a list of custom game builds

       The following list-builds example retrieves  properties  for  all  game
       server builds in the current Region. The sample request illustrates how
       to use the pagination parameters, Limit and NextToken, to retrieve  the
       results  in  sequential sets. The first command retrieves the first two
       builds. Because there are more than two  available,  the  response  in-
       cludes a NextToken to indicate that more results are available.

          aws gamelift list-builds \
              --limit 2

       Output:

          {
              "Builds": [
                  {
                      "BuildArn": "arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::build/build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "BuildId": "build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "CreationTime": 1495664528.723,
                      "Name": "My_Game_Server_Build_One",
                      "OperatingSystem": "WINDOWS_2012",
                      "SizeOnDisk": 8567781,
                      "Status": "READY",
                      "Version": "12345.678"
                  },
                  {
                      "BuildArn": "arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::build/build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",
                      "BuildId": "build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",
                      "CreationTime": 1495528748.555,
                      "Name": "My_Game_Server_Build_Two",
                      "OperatingSystem": "AMAZON_LINUX_2",
                      "SizeOnDisk": 8567781,
                      "Status": "FAILED",
                      "Version": "23456.789"
                  }
              ],
              "NextToken": "eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC01NWYxZTZmMS1jY2FlLTQ3YTctOWI5ZS1iYjFkYTQwMjJEXAMPLE="
          }

       You  can then call the command again with the --next-token parameter as
       follows to see the next two builds.

          aws gamelift list-builds \
              --limit 2
              --next-token eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC01NWYxZTZmMS1jY2FlLTQ3YTctOWI5ZS1iYjFkYTQwMjJEXAMPLE=

       Repeat until the response doesn't include a NextToken value.

       Example2: To get a list of custom game builds in failure status

       The following list-builds example retrieves  properties  for  all  game
       server builds in the current region that currently have status FAILED.

          aws gamelift list-builds \
              --status FAILED

       Output:

          {
              "Builds": [
                  {
                      "BuildArn": "arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::build/build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",
                      "BuildId": "build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",
                      "CreationTime": 1495528748.555,
                      "Name": "My_Game_Server_Build_Two",
                      "OperatingSystem": "AMAZON_LINUX_2",
                      "SizeOnDisk": 8567781,
                      "Status": "FAILED",
                      "Version": "23456.789"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Builds -> (list)
          A collection of build resources that match the request.

          (structure)
              Properties describing a custom game build.
                 All APIs by task

              BuildId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the build.

              BuildArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) assigned to a GameLift build
                 resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are  unique  across
                 all      Regions.     Format     is     arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
                 gion>::build/build-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .  In
                 a  GameLift  build  ARN,  the resource ID matches the BuildId
                 value.

              Name -> (string)
                 A descriptive label associated with a build. Build  names  do
                 not  need  to  be  unique. It can be set using CreateBuild or
                 UpdateBuild .

              Version -> (string)
                 Version information associated with a build or  script.  Ver-
                 sion strings do not need to be unique.

              Status -> (string)
                 Current status of the build.

                 Possible build statuses include the following:

                 o INITIALIZED  --  A new build has been defined, but no files
                   have been uploaded. You cannot  create  fleets  for  builds
                   that  are in this status. When a build is successfully cre-
                   ated, the build status is set to this value.

                 o READY -- The game build has been successfully uploaded. You
                   can now create new fleets for this build.

                 o FAILED  --  The game build upload failed. You cannot create
                   new fleets for this build.

              SizeOnDisk -> (long)
                 File size of the uploaded game  build,  expressed  in  bytes.
                 When  the  build status is INITIALIZED or when using a custom
                 Amazon S3 storage location, this value is 0.

              OperatingSystem -> (string)
                 Operating system that the game server binaries are  built  to
                 run  on.  This  value  determines the type of fleet resources
                 that you can use for this build.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp indicating when this data  object  was  created.
                 Format  is  a  number  expressed in Unix time as milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              ServerSdkVersion -> (string)
                 The GameLift Server SDK version used  to  develop  your  game
                 server.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
