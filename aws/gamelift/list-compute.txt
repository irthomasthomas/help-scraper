LIST-COMPUTE()                                                  LIST-COMPUTE()



NAME
       list-compute -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  all  compute  resources registered to a fleet in your Amazon
       Web Services account. You can filter the result set by location.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-compute is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: ComputeList

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the fleet the compute resources are regis-
          tered to.

       --location (string)
          The name of the custom location that the compute resources  are  as-
          signed to.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ComputeList -> (list)
          A list of compute resources registered to the fleet you specified.

          (structure)
              Resources used to host your game servers. A compute resource can
              be managed Amazon GameLift Amazon EC2 instances or your own  re-
              sources.

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A  unique identifier for the fleet that the compute is regis-
                 tered to.

              FleetArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the fleet that the  compute
                 is registered to.

              ComputeName -> (string)
                 A  descriptive  label that is associated with the compute re-
                 source registered to your fleet.

              ComputeArn -> (string)
                 The ARN that is assigned to the compute resource and uniquely
                 identifies it. ARNs are unique across locations.

              IpAddress -> (string)
                 The  IP  address of the compute resource. Amazon GameLift re-
                 quires the DNS name or IP address to manage your compute  re-
                 source.

              DnsName -> (string)
                 The  DNS  name  of  the compute resource. Amazon GameLift re-
                 quires the DNS name or IP address to manage your compute  re-
                 source.

              ComputeStatus -> (string)
                 Current  status of the compute. A compute must have an ACTIVE
                 status to host game sessions.

              Location -> (string)
                 The name of the custom location you added to the  fleet  that
                 this compute resource resides in.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  time  stamp  indicating when this data object was created.
                 Format is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              OperatingSystem -> (string)
                 The type of operating system on your compute resource.

              Type -> (string)
                 The  compute  type  that the fleet uses. A fleet can use Any-
                 where compute resources that you own, or use  managed  Amazon
                 EC2 instances.

              GameLiftServiceSdkEndpoint -> (string)
                 The  endpoint  connection  details of the Amazon GameLift SDK
                 endpoint that your game server connects to.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where to resume  retrieving  results  on  the
          next  call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results
          represent the end of the list.
