LIST-COMPUTE()                                                  LIST-COMPUTE()



NAME
       list-compute -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  on  the compute resources in an Amazon GameLift
       fleet. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results in  a  set  of
       sequential pages.
          Request options:

       o Retrieve a list of all computes in a fleet. Specify a fleet ID.

       o Retrieve a list of all computes in a specific fleet location. Specify
         a fleet ID and location.
          Results:

       If successful, this operation returns information on a set of computes.
       Depending  on  the type of fleet, the result includes the following in-
       formation:

       o For managed EC2 fleets (compute type EC2 ),  this  operation  returns
         information  about  the  EC2 instance. Compute names are EC2 instance
         IDs.

       o For Anywhere fleets (compute type ANYWHERE ), this operation  returns
         compute names and details as provided when the compute was registered
         with RegisterCompute . This  includes  GameLiftServiceSdkEndpoint  or
         GameLiftAgentEndpoint .

       list-compute is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: ComputeList

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to retrieve compute resources for.

       --location (string)
          The name of a location to retrieve compute  resources  for.  For  an
          Amazon GameLift Anywhere fleet, use a custom location. For a managed
          fleet, provide a Amazon Web Services Region or Local Zone code  (for
          example: us-west-2 or us-west-2-lax-1 ).

       --container-group-definition-name (string)
          For  computes in a managed container fleet, the name of the deployed
          container group definition.

       --compute-status (string)
          The status of computes in a managed container fleet,  based  on  the
          success of the latest update deployment.

          o ACTIVE -- The compute is deployed with the correct container defi-
            nitions. It is ready to process game servers and  host  game  ses-
            sions.

          o IMPAIRED  --  An  update deployment to the compute failed, and the
            compute is deployed with incorrect container definitions.

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o IMPAIRED

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ComputeList -> (list)
          A list of compute resources in the specified fleet.

          (structure)
              An  Amazon  GameLift  compute  resource  for  hosting  your game
              servers. Computes in an Amazon GameLift fleet differs  depending
              on the fleet's compute type property as follows:

              o For managed EC2 fleets, a compute is an EC2 instance.

              o For  Anywhere  fleets,  a compute is a computing resource that
                you provide and is registered to the fleet.

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the fleet that  the  compute  belongs
                 to.

              FleetArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the fleet that the compute
                 belongs to.

              ComputeName -> (string)
                 A descriptive label for the compute resource.  For  instances
                 in a managed EC2 fleet, the compute name is the same value as
                 the InstanceId ID.

              ComputeArn -> (string)
                 The ARN that is assigned to a compute resource  and  uniquely
                 identifies it. ARNs are unique across locations. Instances in
                 managed EC2 fleets are not assigned a Compute ARN.

              IpAddress -> (string)
                 The IP address of a compute  resource.  Amazon  GameLift  re-
                 quires a DNS name or IP address for a compute.

              DnsName -> (string)
                 The  DNS name of a compute resource. Amazon GameLift requires
                 a DNS name or IP address for a compute.

              ComputeStatus -> (string)
                 Current status of the compute. A compute must have an  ACTIVE
                 status to host game sessions.

              Location -> (string)
                 The  name  of the custom location you added to the fleet that
                 this compute resource resides in.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp indicating when this data  object  was  created.
                 Format  is  a  number  expressed in Unix time as milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              OperatingSystem -> (string)
                 The type of operating system on the compute resource.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon Linux  2  (AL2)  will  reach  end  of  support  on
                     6/30/2025.  See more details in the Amazon Linux 2 FAQs .
                     For game servers that are hosted on AL2  and  use  Amazon
                     GameLift  server  SDK  4.x., first update the game server
                     build to server SDK 5.x, and then deploy  to  AL2023  in-
                     stances.  See  Migrate to Amazon GameLift server SDK ver-
                     sion 5.

              Type -> (string)
                 The Amazon EC2 instance type that the fleet uses. For  regis-
                 tered  computes  in  an  Amazon GameLift Anywhere fleet, this
                 property is empty.

              GameLiftServiceSdkEndpoint -> (string)
                 The Amazon GameLift SDK endpoint connection for a  registered
                 compute  resource  in  an Anywhere fleet. The game servers on
                 the compute use  this  endpoint  to  connect  to  the  Amazon
                 GameLift service.

              GameLiftAgentEndpoint -> (string)
                 The endpoint of the Amazon GameLift Agent.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The  InstanceID  of the EC2 instance that is hosting the com-
                 pute.

              ContainerAttributes -> (list)
                 A set of attributes for each container in the compute.

                 (structure)
                     A unique identifier for a container in a container  fleet
                     compute.
                        Returned by:   DescribeCompute

                     ContainerName -> (string)
                        The  identifier  for  a  container that's running in a
                        compute.

                     ContainerRuntimeId -> (string)
                        The runtime ID for the container that's running  in  a
                        compute. This value is unique within the compute.

              GameServerContainerGroupDefinitionArn -> (string)
                 The game server container group definition for the compute.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
