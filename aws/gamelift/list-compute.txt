LIST-COMPUTE()                                                  LIST-COMPUTE()



NAME
       list-compute -

DESCRIPTION
          This  operation  has  been  expanded to use with the Amazon GameLift
          containers feature, which is currently in public preview.

       Retrieves information on the compute resources in  an  Amazon  GameLift
       fleet.

       To request a list of computes, specify the fleet ID. Use the pagination
       parameters to retrieve results in a set of sequential pages.

       You can filter the result set by location.

       If successful, this operation returns information on  all  computes  in
       the  requested fleet. Depending on the fleet's compute type, the result
       includes the following information:

       o For EC2 fleets, this operation returns information about the EC2  in-
         stance. Compute names are instance IDs.

       o For ANYWHERE fleets, this operation returns the compute names and de-
         tails provided when the compute was registered with RegisterCompute .
         The GameLiftServiceSdkEndpoint or GameLiftAgentEndpoint is included.

       o For  CONTAINER  fleets, this operation returns information about con-
         tainers that are registered as computes, and  the  instances  they're
         running on. Compute names are container names.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-compute is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: ComputeList

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to retrieve compute resources for.

       --location (string)
          The name of a location to retrieve compute  resources  for.  For  an
          Amazon  GameLift  Anywhere  fleet,  use  a  custom  location.  For a
          multi-location EC2 or container fleet, provide a Amazon Web Services
          Region or Local Zone code (for example: us-west-2 or us-west-2-lax-1
          ).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ComputeList -> (list)
          A list of compute resources in the specified fleet.

          (structure)
                 This  data  type  has  been  expanded  to use with the Amazon
                 GameLift containers feature, which  is  currently  in  public
                 preview.

              An  Amazon  GameLift  compute  resource  for  hosting  your game
              servers. Computes in an Amazon GameLift fleet differs  depending
              on the fleet's compute type property as follows:

              o For EC2 fleets, a compute is an EC2 instance.

              o For  ANYWHERE  fleets,  a compute is a computing resource that
                you provide and is registered to the fleet.

              o For CONTAINER fleets, a compute is a container  that's  regis-
                tered to the fleet.

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier  for the fleet that the compute belongs
                 to.

              FleetArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the fleet that the  compute
                 belongs to.

              ComputeName -> (string)
                 A  descriptive  label for the compute resource. For instances
                 in a managed EC2 fleet, the compute name is the same value as
                 the InstanceId ID.

              ComputeArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  that is assigned to a compute resource and uniquely
                 identifies it. ARNs are unique across locations. Instances in
                 managed EC2 fleets are not assigned a Compute ARN.

              IpAddress -> (string)
                 The  IP  address  of  a compute resource. Amazon GameLift re-
                 quires a DNS name or IP address for a compute.

              DnsName -> (string)
                 The DNS name of a compute resource. Amazon GameLift  requires
                 a DNS name or IP address for a compute.

              ComputeStatus -> (string)
                 Current  status of the compute. A compute must have an ACTIVE
                 status to host game sessions.

              Location -> (string)
                 The name of the custom location you added to the  fleet  that
                 this compute resource resides in.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  time  stamp  indicating when this data object was created.
                 Format is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              OperatingSystem -> (string)
                 The type of operating system on the compute resource.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon  Linux  2  (AL2)  will  reach  end  of  support on
                     6/30/2025. See more details in the Amazon Linux 2 FAQs  .
                     For  game  servers  that are hosted on AL2 and use Amazon
                     GameLift server SDK 4.x., first update  the  game  server
                     build  to  server  SDK 5.x, and then deploy to AL2023 in-
                     stances. See Migrate to Amazon GameLift server  SDK  ver-
                     sion 5.

              Type -> (string)
                 The  Amazon EC2 instance type that the fleet uses. For regis-
                 tered computes in an Amazon  GameLift  Anywhere  fleet,  this
                 property is empty.

              GameLiftServiceSdkEndpoint -> (string)
                 The  Amazon GameLift SDK endpoint connection for a registered
                 compute resource in an Anywhere fleet. The  game  servers  on
                 the  compute  use  this  endpoint  to  connect  to the Amazon
                 GameLift service.

              GameLiftAgentEndpoint -> (string)
                 The endpoint of the Amazon GameLift Agent.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The InstanceID of the Instance hosting the compute  for  Con-
                 tainer and Managed EC2 fleets.

              ContainerAttributes -> (structure)
                 Some attributes of a container.

                 ContainerPortMappings -> (list)
                     Describes  how container ports map to connection ports on
                     the fleet instance. Incoming traffic connects to  a  game
                     via a connection port. A ContainerPortMapping directs the
                     traffic from a connection port to a port on the container
                     that hosts the game session.

                     (structure)
                            This  data  type  is used with the Amazon GameLift
                            containers feature, which is currently  in  public
                            preview.

                        Defines  how  an  internal-facing  container  port  is
                        mapped to an  external-facing  connection  port  on  a
                        fleet  instance  of  compute type CONTAINER . Incoming
                        traffic, such as a game client, uses a connection port
                        to connect to a process in the container fleet. Amazon
                        GameLift directs the inbound traffic to the  container
                        port  that  is assigned to the process, such as a game
                        session, running on a container.
                            Part of:   ContainerAttributes

                        ContainerPort -> (integer)
                            The port opened on the container.

                        ConnectionPort -> (integer)
                            The port opened on the  fleet  instance.  This  is
                            also called the "host port".

                        Protocol -> (string)
                            The network protocol that this mapping supports.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
