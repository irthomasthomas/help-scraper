NAME
       describe-matchmaking-rule-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the details for FlexMatch matchmaking rule sets. You can re-
       quest all existing rule sets for the Region, or provide a list  of  one
       or more rule set names. When requesting multiple items, use the pagina-
       tion parameters to retrieve results as a set of  sequential  pages.  If
       successful, a rule set is returned for each requested name.

       describe-matchmaking-rule-sets  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: RuleSets

OPTIONS
       --names (list)
          A list of one or more matchmaking rule set names to retrieve details
          for.  (Note: The rule set name is different from the optional "name"
          field in the rule set body.) You can use either the rule set name or
          ARN value.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       RuleSets -> (list)
          A collection of requested matchmaking rule set objects.

          (structure)
              Set  of rule statements, used with FlexMatch, that determine how
              to build your player matches. Each rule set describes a type  of
              group  to  be  created and defines the parameters for acceptable
              player matches.

              A rule set may define the following elements for  a  match.  For
              detailed  information  and  examples  showing how to construct a
              rule set, see Build a FlexMatch rule set .

              o Teams -- Required. A rule set  must  define  one  or  multiple
                teams  for  the  match and set minimum and maximum team sizes.
                For example, a rule set might describe a 4x4  match  that  re-
                quires all eight slots to be filled.

              o Player  attributes -- Optional. These attributes specify a set
                of player characteristics  to  evaluate  when  looking  for  a
                match.  Matchmaking  requests  that use a rule set with player
                attributes must provide the  corresponding  attribute  values.
                For  example,  an  attribute might specify a player's skill or
                level.

              o Rules -- Optional. Rules  define  how  to  evaluate  potential
                players  for  a match based on player attributes. A rule might
                specify minimum requirements for individual players, teams, or
                entire  matches. For example, a rule might require each player
                to meet a certain skill level, each team to have at least  one
                player in a certain role, or the match to have a minimum aver-
                age skill level. or may describe an entire group--such as  all
                teams  must be evenly matched or have at least one player in a
                certain role.

              o Expansions -- Optional. Expansions  allow  you  to  relax  the
                rules  after  a  period of time when no acceptable matches are
                found. This feature lets  you  balance  getting  players  into
                games  in  a  reasonable amount of time instead of making them
                wait indefinitely for the best possible  match.  For  example,
                you might use an expansion to increase the maximum skill vari-
                ance between players after 30 seconds.

              RuleSetName -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the matchmaking rule set

              RuleSetArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a  Amazon
                 GameLift  matchmaking  rule set resource and uniquely identi-
                 fies it. ARNs  are  unique  across  all  Regions.  Format  is
                 arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::matchmakingruleset/<ruleset  name>
                 . In a GameLift rule set ARN, the  resource  ID  matches  the
                 RuleSetName value.

              RuleSetBody -> (string)
                 A  collection  of  matchmaking  rules,  formatted  as  a JSON
                 string. Comments are not allowed in JSON, but  most  elements
                 support a description field.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  time  stamp  indicating when this data object was created.
                 Format is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
