GET-COMPUTE-AUTH-TOKEN()                              GET-COMPUTE-AUTH-TOKEN()



NAME
       get-compute-auth-token -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests  an authorization token from GameLift. The authorization token
       is used by your game server to authenticate with GameLift. Each authen-
       tication  token  has an expiration token. To continue using the compute
       resource to host your game server, regularly retrieve a new  authoriza-
       tion token.

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that the compute is registered to.

       --compute-name (string)
          The  name  of the compute resource you are requesting the authoriza-
          tion token for.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that the compute is registered to.

       FleetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift fleet
          resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all  Re-
          gions.           Format           is           arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
          gion>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .

       ComputeName -> (string)
          The name of the compute resource you are requesting  the  authoriza-
          tion token for.

       ComputeArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift com-
          pute resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all
          Regions.     Format    is    arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::compute/com-
          pute-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912

       AuthToken -> (string)
          The authorization token that your game server uses  to  authenticate
          with GameLift.

       ExpirationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          The amount of time until the authorization token is no longer valid.
          To continue using the compute resource for game server hosting,  re-
          new the authorization token by using this operation again.
