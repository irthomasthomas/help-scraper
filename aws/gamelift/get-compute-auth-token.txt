GET-COMPUTE-AUTH-TOKEN()                              GET-COMPUTE-AUTH-TOKEN()



NAME
       get-compute-auth-token -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests an authentication token from Amazon GameLift for a compute re-
       source in an Amazon GameLift Anywhere fleet or  container  fleet.  Game
       servers  that  are running on the compute use this token to communicate
       with the Amazon GameLift service,  such  as  when  calling  the  Amazon
       GameLift  server SDK action InitSDK() . Authentication tokens are valid
       for a limited time span, so you need to request a  fresh  token  before
       the current token expires.

       Use this operation based on the fleet compute type:

       o For EC2 fleets, auth token retrieval and refresh is handled automati-
         cally. All game servers that are running on all fleet instances  have
         access to a valid auth token.

       o For  ANYWHERE  and  CONTAINER  fleets,  if  you're  using  the Amazon
         GameLift Agent, auth token retrieval and refresh is handled automati-
         cally  for  any container or Anywhere compute where the Agent is run-
         ning. If you're not using the Agent, create a mechanism  to  retrieve
         and  refresh  auth  tokens  for computes that are running game server
         processes.

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that the compute is registered to.

       --compute-name (string)
          The name of the compute resource you are requesting the  authentica-
          tion  token  for.  For an Anywhere fleet compute, use the registered
          compute name. For an EC2 fleet instance, use the instance ID. For  a
          container    fleet,    use    the   compute   name   (for   example,
          a123b456c789012d3e4567f8a901b23c/1a234b56-7cd8-9e0f-a1b2-c34d567ef8a9
          ) or the compute ARN.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
