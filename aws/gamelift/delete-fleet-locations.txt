DELETE-FLEET-LOCATIONS()                              DELETE-FLEET-LOCATIONS()



NAME
       delete-fleet-locations -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  locations  from  a multi-location fleet. When deleting a loca-
       tion, all game server process and all instances that are  still  active
       in the location are shut down.

       To  delete fleet locations, identify the fleet ID and provide a list of
       the locations to be deleted.

       If successful, GameLift sets the location status to DELETING , and  be-
       gins  to shut down existing server processes and terminate instances in
       each location  being  deleted.  When  completed,  the  location  status
       changes to TERMINATED .

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the fleet to delete locations for. You can
          use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --locations (list)
          The list of fleet locations to delete. Specify locations in the form
          of an Amazon Web Services Region code, such as us-west-2 .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that location attributes are being
          deleted for.

       FleetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN  )  that  is  assigned  to  a  Amazon
          GameLift  fleet resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique
          across    all    Regions.    Format     is     arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
          gion>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .

       LocationStates -> (list)
          The remote locations that are being deleted, with each location sta-
          tus set to DELETING .

          (structure)
              A fleet location and its life-cycle state. A location state  ob-
              ject might be used to describe a fleet's remote location or home
              Region. Life-cycle state tracks the progress  of  launching  the
              first instance in a new location and preparing it for game host-
              ing, and then removing all instances and deleting  the  location
              from the fleet.

              o NEW  --  A new fleet location has been defined and desired in-
                stances is set to 1.

              o DOWNLOADING/VALIDATING/BUILDING/ACTIVATING -- Amazon  GameLift
                is  setting  up the new fleet location, creating new instances
                with the game build or Realtime  script  and  starting  server
                processes.

              o ACTIVE -- Hosts can now accept game sessions.

              o ERROR  --  An  error  occurred  when  downloading, validating,
                building, or activating the fleet location.

              o DELETING -- Hosts are responding to a  delete  fleet  location
                request.

              o TERMINATED -- The fleet location no longer exists.

              o NOT_FOUND  --  The fleet location was not found. This could be
                because the custom location was removed or not created.

              Location -> (string)
                 The fleet location, expressed as an Amazon Web  Services  Re-
                 gion code such as us-west-2 .

              Status -> (string)
                 The life-cycle status of a fleet location.
