NAME
       describe-vpc-peering-connections -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information on VPC peering connections. Use this operation to
       get peering information for all fleets or for one specific fleet ID.

       To retrieve connection information, call this operation from the Amazon
       Web Services account that is used to manage the Amazon GameLift fleets.
       Specify a fleet ID or leave the parameter empty to retrieve all connec-
       tion  records.  If  successful, the retrieved information includes both
       active and pending connections. Active connections  identify  the  IpV4
       CIDR block that the VPC uses to connect.

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the fleet. You can use either the fleet ID
          or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       VpcPeeringConnections -> (list)
          A  collection  of  VPC peering connection records that match the re-
          quest.

          (structure)
              Represents a peering connection between a VPC  on  one  of  your
              Amazon  Web  Services  accounts  and  the  VPC  for  your Amazon
              GameLift fleets. This record may be for an active  peering  con-
              nection  or  a  pending  connection that has not yet been estab-
              lished.

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the fleet. This ID determines the  ID
                 of the Amazon GameLift VPC for your fleet.

              FleetArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) associated with the GameLift
                 fleet resource for this connection.

              IpV4CidrBlock -> (string)
                 CIDR block of IPv4 addresses assigned to the VPC peering con-
                 nection for the GameLift VPC. The peered VPC also has an IPv4
                 CIDR block associated with it; these blocks cannot overlap or
                 the peering connection cannot be created.

              VpcPeeringConnectionId -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier  that  is automatically assigned to the
                 connection record. This ID is referenced in VPC peering  con-
                 nection events, and is used when deleting a connection.

              Status -> (structure)
                 The status information about the connection. Status indicates
                 if a connection is pending, successful, or failed.

                 Code -> (string)
                     Code indicating the status of a VPC peering connection.

                 Message -> (string)
                     Additional messaging associated with the connection  sta-
                     tus.

              PeerVpcId -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed
                 by your Amazon GameLift fleet. The VPC must be  in  the  same
                 Region  as your fleet. To look up a VPC ID, use the VPC Dash-
                 board in the Amazon Web Services  Management  Console.  Learn
                 more  about  VPC  peering in VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift
                 Fleets .

              GameLiftVpcId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the  VPC  that  contains  the  Amazon
                 GameLift  fleet  for  this connection. This VPC is managed by
                 Amazon GameLift and does not appear in your Amazon  Web  Ser-
                 vices account.
