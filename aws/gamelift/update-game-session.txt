OPTIONS
       --game-session-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the game session to update.

       --maximum-player-session-count (integer)
          The maximum number of players that can be  connected  simultaneously
          to the game session.

       --name (string)
          A  descriptive label that is associated with a game session. Session
          names do not need to be unique.

       --player-session-creation-policy (string)
          A policy that determines whether the game session is  accepting  new
          players.

          Possible values:

          o ACCEPT_ALL

          o DENY_ALL

       --protection-policy (string)
          Game session protection policy to apply to this game session only.

          o NoProtection  --  The  game  session  can  be  terminated during a
            scale-down event.

          o FullProtection -- If the game session is in an ACTIVE  status,  it
            cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.

          Possible values:

          o NoProtection

          o FullProtection

       --game-properties (list)
          A  set  of key-value pairs that can store custom data in a game ses-
          sion. For example: {"Key": "difficulty", "Value":  "novice"}  .  You
          can  use  this parameter to modify game properties in an active game
          session. This action adds new properties and modifies existing prop-
          erties.  There  is  no way to delete properties. For an example, see
          Update the value of a game property .

          (structure)
              This key-value pair can store custom data about a game  session.
              For  example,  you might use a GameProperty to track a game ses-
              sion's map, level of difficulty, or remaining time.  The  diffi-
              culty  level could be specified like this: {"Key": "difficulty",
              "Value":"Novice"} .

              You can set game properties when creating a  game  session.  You
              can  also modify game properties of an active game session. When
              searching for game sessions, you can  filter  on  game  property
              keys  and  values.  You can't delete game properties from a game
              session.

              For examples of working with game properties, see Create a  game
              session with properties .

              Key -> (string)
                 The game property identifier.

              Value -> (string)
                 The game property value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

          CurrentPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)
              Number of players currently in the game session.

          MaximumPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)
              The maximum number of players that can be  connected  simultane-
              ously to the game session.

          Status -> (string)
              Current  status of the game session. A game session must have an
              ACTIVE status to have player sessions.

          StatusReason -> (string)
              Provides additional information about game session  status.  IN-
              TERRUPTED  indicates  that the game session was hosted on a spot
              instance that was reclaimed, causing the active game session  to
              be terminated.

          GameProperties -> (list)
              A  set  of  key-value pairs that can store custom data in a game
              session. For example: {"Key": "difficulty", "Value": "novice"} .

              (structure)
                 This key-value pair can store custom data about a  game  ses-
                 sion.  For  example,  you might use a GameProperty to track a
                 game session's map, level of difficulty, or  remaining  time.
                 The  difficulty  level  could be specified like this: {"Key":
                 "difficulty", "Value":"Novice"} .

                 You can set game properties when creating a game session. You
                 can  also  modify  game properties of an active game session.
                 When searching for game sessions,  you  can  filter  on  game
                 property  keys  and  values. You can't delete game properties
                 from a game session.

                 For examples of working with game properties,  see  Create  a
                 game session with properties .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The game property identifier.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The game property value.

          IpAddress -> (string)
              The  IP  address  of  the  game  session. To connect to a Amazon
              GameLift game server, an app needs both the IP address and  port
              number.

          DnsName -> (string)
              The  DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is running the
              game session. Values have the following format:

              o TLS-enabled  fleets:   <unique   identifier>.<region   identi-
                fier>.amazongamelift.com .

              o Non-TLS-enabled  fleets:  ec2-<unique identifier>.compute.ama-
                zonaws.com . (See Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing .)

              When connecting to a game session that is running on  a  TLS-en-
              abled fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP address.

          Port -> (integer)
              The  port  number  for  the game session. To connect to a Amazon
              GameLift game server, an app needs both the IP address and  port
              number.

          PlayerSessionCreationPolicy -> (string)
              Indicates whether or not the game session is accepting new play-
              ers.

          CreatorId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for a player. This ID is used to  enforce  a
              resource protection policy (if one exists), that limits the num-
              ber of game sessions a player can create.

          GameSessionData -> (string)
              A set of custom game session properties, formatted as  a  single
              string  value. This data is passed to a game server process with
              a request to start a new game session. For more information, see
              Start a game session .

          MatchmakerData -> (string)
              Information  about  the matchmaking process that resulted in the
              game session, if matchmaking was used. Data is in  JSON  syntax,
              formatted as a string. Information includes the matchmaker ID as
              well as player attributes and team assignments. For more details
              on  matchmaker data, see Match Data . Matchmaker data is updated
              whenever new players are added during a successful backfill (see
              StartMatchBackfill ).

          Location -> (string)
              The fleet location where the game session is running. This value
              might specify the fleet's home Region or a remote location.  Lo-
              cation  is  expressed as an Amazon Web Services Region code such
              as us-west-2 .
