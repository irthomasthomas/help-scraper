       list-scripts is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: Scripts

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

       Scripts -> (list)
          A set of properties describing the requested script.

          (structure)

              ScriptId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the Realtime script

              ScriptArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a Amazon
                 GameLift script resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are
                 unique  across all Regions. In a GameLift script ARN, the re-
                 source ID matches the ScriptId value.

              Name -> (string)
                 A descriptive label that is associated with a script.  Script
                 names don't need to be unique.

              Version -> (string)
                 Version  information  associated with a build or script. Ver-
                 sion strings don't need to be unique.

              SizeOnDisk -> (long)
                 The file size of the uploaded Realtime script,  expressed  in
                 bytes.  When  files  are  uploaded  from an S3 location, this
                 value remains at "0".

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp indicating when this data  object  was  created.
                 Format  is  a  number  expressed in Unix time as milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              StorageLocation -> (structure)
                 The location of the Amazon S3 bucket where a zipped file con-
                 taining your Realtime scripts is stored. The storage location
                 must specify the Amazon S3 bucket name,  the  zip  file  name
                 (the  "key"),  and  a role ARN that allows Amazon GameLift to
                 access the Amazon S3 storage location. The S3 bucket must  be
                 in  the same Region where you want to create a new script. By
                 default, Amazon GameLift uploads the latest  version  of  the
                 zip file; if you have S3 object versioning turned on, you can
                 use the ObjectVersion parameter to specify  an  earlier  ver-
                 sion.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     An Amazon S3 bucket identifier. Thename of the S3 bucket.

                     NOTE:
                        Amazon  GameLift doesn't support uploading from Amazon
                        S3 buckets with names that contain a dot (.).

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name of the zip file that contains the build files or
                     script files.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role that al-
                     lows Amazon GameLift to access the S3 bucket.

                 ObjectVersion -> (string)
                     The version of the file, if object versioning  is  turned
                     on  for the bucket. Amazon GameLift uses this information
                     when retrieving files from an S3 bucket that you own. Use
                     this parameter to specify a specific version of the file.
                     If not set, the latest version of the file is retrieved.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where to resume  retrieving  results  on  the
          next  call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results
          represent the end of the list.
