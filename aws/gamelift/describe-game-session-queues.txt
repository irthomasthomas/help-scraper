NAME
       describe-game-session-queues -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the properties for one or more game session queues. When re-
       questing multiple queues, use the pagination parameters to retrieve re-
       sults  as  a set of sequential pages. When specifying a list of queues,
       objects are returned only for queues that currently exist  in  the  Re-
       gion.

       describe-game-session-queues  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: GameSessionQueues

OPTIONS
       --names (list)
          A list of queue names to retrieve information for. You can  use  ei-
          ther  the queue ID or ARN value. To request settings for all queues,
          leave this parameter empty.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       GameSessionQueues -> (list)
          A collection of objects that describe  the  requested  game  session
          queues.

          (structure)
              Configuration  for  a game session placement mechanism that pro-
              cesses requests for new game sessions. A queue can  be  used  on
              its own or as part of a matchmaking solution.

              Name -> (string)
                 A  descriptive  label  that  is  associated with game session
                 queue. Queue names must be unique within each Region.

              GameSessionQueueArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a  Amazon
                 GameLift  game session queue resource and uniquely identifies
                 it.  ARNs  are  unique  across   all   Regions.   Format   is
                 arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesessionqueue/<queue name> . In
                 a Amazon GameLift game session queue  ARN,  the  resource  ID
                 matches the Name value.

              TimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The  maximum time, in seconds, that a new game session place-
                 ment request remains in the queue.  When  a  request  exceeds
                 this  time, the game session placement changes to a TIMED_OUT
                 status.

              PlayerLatencyPolicies -> (list)
                 A set of policies that enforce a sliding cap  on  player  la-
                 tency  when  processing game sessions placement requests. Use
                 multiple policies to gradually relax the  cap  over  time  if
                 Amazon  GameLift  can't make a placement. Policies are evalu-
                 ated in order starting with the lowest maximum latency value.

                 (structure)
                     Sets a latency cap for individual players when placing  a
                     game session. With a latency policy in force, a game ses-
                     sion cannot be placed in a fleet location where a  player
                     reports latency higher than the cap. Latency policies are
                     used only with placement request that provide player  la-
                     tency information. Player latency policies can be stacked
                     to gradually relax latency requirements over time.

                     MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds -> (integer)
                        The maximum latency value  that  is  allowed  for  any
                        player,  in  milliseconds.  All  policies  must have a
                        value set for this property.

                     PolicyDurationSeconds -> (integer)
                        The length of time, in seconds, that the policy is en-
                        forced  while placing a new game session. A null value
                        for this property means that the  policy  is  enforced
                        until the queue times out.

              Destinations -> (list)
                 A  list  of  fleets  and/or fleet aliases that can be used to
                 fulfill game session placement requests in the queue.  Desti-
                 nations are identified by either a fleet ARN or a fleet alias
                 ARN, and are listed in order of placement preference.

                 (structure)
                     A fleet or alias designated  in  a  game  session  queue.
                     Queues  fulfill requests for new game sessions by placing
                     a new game session on any of the queue's destinations.

                     DestinationArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  that  is  assigned  to
                        fleet  or  fleet alias. ARNs, which include a fleet ID
                        or alias ID and a Region name, provide a unique  iden-
                        tifier across all Regions.

              FilterConfiguration -> (structure)
                 A  list  of  locations  where a queue is allowed to place new
                 game sessions. Locations are specified in the form of  Amazon
                 Web Services Region codes, such as us-west-2 . If this param-
                 eter is not set, game sessions can be placed in any queue lo-
                 cation.

                 AllowedLocations -> (list)
                     A  list  of locations to allow game session placement in,
                     in the form of Amazon Web Services Region codes  such  as
                     us-west-2 .

                     (string)

              PriorityConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Custom settings to use when prioritizing destinations and lo-
                 cations for game session placements. This  configuration  re-
                 places  the  FleetIQ default prioritization process. Priority
                 types that are not explicitly named will be automatically ap-
                 plied at the end of the prioritization process.

                 PriorityOrder -> (list)
                     The  recommended  sequence to use when prioritizing where
                     to place new game sessions. Each type can only be  listed
                     once.

                     o LATENCY  -- FleetIQ prioritizes locations where the av-
                       erage player latency (provided in each game session re-
                       quest) is lowest.

                     o COST  -- FleetIQ prioritizes destinations with the low-
                       est current hosting costs. Cost is evaluated  based  on
                       the  location,  instance  type, and fleet type (Spot or
                       On-Demand) for each destination in the queue.

                     o DESTINATION -- FleetIQ prioritizes based on  the  order
                       that  destinations  are  listed in the queue configura-
                       tion.

                     o LOCATION -- FleetIQ prioritizes based on  the  provided
                       order of locations, as defined in LocationOrder .

                     (string)

                 LocationOrder -> (list)
                     The prioritization order to use for fleet locations, when
                     the PriorityOrder property includes LOCATION .  Locations
                     are  identified  by Amazon Web Services Region codes such
                     as us-west-2 . Each location can only be listed once.

                     (string)

              CustomEventData -> (string)
                 Information that is added to all events that are  related  to
                 this game session queue.

              NotificationTarget -> (string)
                 An  SNS  topic  ARN  that  is  set up to receive game session
                 placement notifications. See  Setting  up  notifications  for
                 game session placement .

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
