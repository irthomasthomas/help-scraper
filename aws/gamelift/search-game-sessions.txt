SEARCH-GAME-SESSIONS()                                  SEARCH-GAME-SESSIONS()



NAME
       search-game-sessions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  all active game sessions that match a set of search criteria
       and sorts them into a specified order.

       This operation is not designed to continually track game session status
       because that practice can cause you to exceed your API limit and gener-
       ate errors. Instead, configure an Amazon  Simple  Notification  Service
       (Amazon SNS) topic to receive notifications from a matchmaker or a game
       session placement queue.

       When searching for game sessions, you specify exactly where you want to
       search  and  provide  a search filter expression, a sort expression, or
       both. A search request can search only one fleet, but it can search all
       of a fleet's locations.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To  search  all game sessions that are currently running on all loca-
         tions in a fleet, provide a fleet or alias ID. This approach  returns
         game  sessions  in  the  fleet's home Region and all remote locations
         that fit the search criteria.

       o To search all game sessions that are currently running on a  specific
         fleet  location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name. For
         location, you can specify a fleet's home Region or any  remote  loca-
         tion.

       Use  the  pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequen-
       tial pages.

       If successful, a GameSession object is returned for each  game  session
       that matches the request. Search finds game sessions that are in ACTIVE
       status only. To retrieve information on game  sessions  in  other  sta-
       tuses, use DescribeGameSessions .

       To  set  search and sort criteria, create a filter expression using the
       following game session attributes. For game  session  search  examples,
       see the Examples section of this topic.

       o gameSessionId  --  A  unique identifier for the game session. You can
         use either a GameSessionId or GameSessionArn value.

       o gameSessionName -- Name assigned to  a  game  session.  Game  session
         names do not need to be unique to a game session.

       o gameSessionProperties -- A set of key-value pairs that can store cus-
         tom data in  a  game  session.  For  example:  {"Key":  "difficulty",
         "Value":  "novice"}  .  The filter expression must specify the  Game-
         Property -- a Key and a string Value to search for the game sessions.
         For example, to search for the above key-value pair, specify the fol-
         lowing search filter: gameSessionProperties.difficulty =  "novice"  .
         All  game  property  values  are searched as strings. For examples of
         searching game sessions, see the ones below, and also see Search game
         sessions by game property .

       o maximumSessions  --  Maximum  number of player sessions allowed for a
         game session.

       o creationTimeMillis -- Value indicating when a game session  was  cre-
         ated. It is expressed in Unix time as milliseconds.

       o playerSessionCount -- Number of players currently connected to a game
         session. This value changes rapidly as players join  the  session  or
         drop out.

       o hasAvailablePlayerSessions -- Boolean value indicating whether a game
         session has reached its maximum number of players. It is highly  rec-
         ommended  that  all  search requests include this filter attribute to
         optimize search performance and return only sessions that players can
         join.

       NOTE:
              Returned  values for playerSessionCount and hasAvailablePlayerS-
              essions change quickly as players join sessions and others  drop
              out. Results should be considered a snapshot in time. Be sure to
              refresh search results often, and handle sessions that  fill  up
              before a player can join.

       search-game-sessions  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: GameSessions

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to search  for  active  game  ses-
          sions.  You  can  use either the fleet ID or ARN value. Each request
          must reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.

       --alias-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the  alias  associated  with  the  fleet  to
          search  for active game sessions. You can use either the alias ID or
          ARN value. Each request must reference either a fleet  ID  or  alias
          ID, but not both.

       --location (string)
          A  fleet  location  to  search  for game sessions. You can specify a
          fleet's home Region or a remote location. Use the  Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices Region code format, such as us-west-2 .

       --filter-expression (string)
          String  containing the search criteria for the session search. If no
          filter expression is included, the request returns results  for  all
          game sessions in the fleet that are in ACTIVE status.

          A  filter  expression  can  contain one or multiple conditions. Each
          condition consists of the following:

          o Operand -- Name of a game  session  attribute.  Valid  values  are
            gameSessionName , gameSessionId , gameSessionProperties , maximum-
            Sessions , creationTimeMillis , playerSessionCount , hasAvailable-
            PlayerSessions .

          o Comparator -- Valid comparators are: = , <> , < , > , <= , >= .

          o Value  -- Value to be searched for. Values may be numbers, boolean
            values (true/false) or strings depending on  the  operand.  String
            values  are  case sensitive and must be enclosed in single quotes.
            Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string values  can
            only be used with the comparators = and <> . For example, the fol-
            lowing filter expression searches on gameSessionName :  "FilterEx-
            pression": "gameSessionName = 'Matt\\'s Awesome Game 1'" .

          To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical
          keywords AND , OR , and NOT and parentheses as needed. For  example:
          x AND y AND NOT z , NOT (x OR y) .

          Session  search  evaluates  conditions  from left to right using the
          following precedence rules:

          o = , <> , < , > , <= , >=

          o Parentheses

          o NOT

          o AND

          o OR

          For example, this filter expression retrieves game sessions  hosting
          at  least  ten  players  that have an open player slot: "maximumSes-
          sions>=10 AND hasAvailablePlayerSessions=true" .

       --sort-expression (string)
          Instructions on how to sort the search results. If no  sort  expres-
          sion  is  included,  the  request returns results in random order. A
          sort expression consists of the following elements:

          o Operand -- Name of a game  session  attribute.  Valid  values  are
            gameSessionName , gameSessionId , gameSessionProperties , maximum-
            Sessions , creationTimeMillis , playerSessionCount , hasAvailable-
            PlayerSessions .

          o Order  -- Valid sort orders are ASC (ascending) and DESC (descend-
            ing).

          For example, this sort expression returns the oldest active sessions
          first:  "SortExpression":  "creationTimeMillis ASC" . Results with a
          null value for the sort operand are returned at the end of the list.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GameSessions -> (list)
          A  collection of objects containing game session properties for each
          session that matches the request.

          (structure)
              Properties describing a game session.

              A game session in ACTIVE status can host players.  When  a  game
              session ends, its status is set to TERMINATED .

              Amazon  GameLift retains a game session resource for 30 days af-
              ter the game session ends. You can reuse idempotency token  val-
              ues after this time. Game session logs are retained for 14 days.

              GameSessionId -> (string)
                 A  unique identifier for the game session. A game session ARN
                 has the following format: arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gameses-
                 sion/<fleet ID>/<custom ID string or idempotency token> .

              Name -> (string)
                 A  descriptive  label that is associated with a game session.
                 Session names do not need to be unique.

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the fleet that the  game  session  is
                 running on.

              FleetArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) associated with the GameLift
                 fleet that this game session is running on.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp indicating when this data  object  was  created.
                 Format  is  a  number  expressed in Unix time as milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              TerminationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp indicating when this data object was terminated.
                 Format  is  a  number  expressed in Unix time as milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              CurrentPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)
                 Number of players currently in the game session.

              MaximumPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of players that can be connected  simulta-
                 neously to the game session.

              Status -> (string)
                 Current  status of the game session. A game session must have
                 an ACTIVE status to have player sessions.

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 Provides additional information about  game  session  status.
                 INTERRUPTED  indicates  that the game session was hosted on a
                 spot instance that was reclaimed,  causing  the  active  game
                 session to be terminated.

              GameProperties -> (list)
                 A set of key-value pairs that can store custom data in a game
                 session.  For   example:   {"Key":   "difficulty",   "Value":
                 "novice"} .

                 (structure)
                     This  key-value  pair  can store custom data about a game
                     session. For example, you might  use  a  GameProperty  to
                     track  a  game session's map, level of difficulty, or re-
                     maining time. The difficulty  level  could  be  specified
                     like this: {"Key": "difficulty", "Value":"Novice"} .

                     You can set game properties when creating a game session.
                     You can also modify game properties  of  an  active  game
                     session. When searching for game sessions, you can filter
                     on game property keys and values. You can't  delete  game
                     properties from a game session.

                     For  examples of working with game properties, see Create
                     a game session with properties .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The game property identifier.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The game property value.

              IpAddress -> (string)
                 The IP address of the game session. To connect  to  a  Amazon
                 GameLift  game  server,  an app needs both the IP address and
                 port number.

              DnsName -> (string)
                 The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that  is  running
                 the game session. Values have the following format:

                 o TLS-enabled  fleets:  <unique  identifier>.<region  identi-
                   fier>.amazongamelift.com .

                 o Non-TLS-enabled   fleets:   ec2-<unique    identifier>.com-
                   pute.amazonaws.com . (See Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing
                   .)

                 When connecting to a  game  session  that  is  running  on  a
                 TLS-enabled  fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP ad-
                 dress.

              Port -> (integer)
                 The port number for the game session. To connect to a  Amazon
                 GameLift  game  server,  an app needs both the IP address and
                 port number.

              PlayerSessionCreationPolicy -> (string)
                 Indicates whether or not the game session  is  accepting  new
                 players.

              CreatorId -> (string)
                 A  unique identifier for a player. This ID is used to enforce
                 a resource protection policy (if one exists), that limits the
                 number of game sessions a player can create.

              GameSessionData -> (string)
                 A  set of custom game session properties, formatted as a sin-
                 gle string value. This  data  is  passed  to  a  game  server
                 process  with a request to start a new game session. For more
                 information, see Start a game session .

              MatchmakerData -> (string)
                 Information about the matchmaking process  that  resulted  in
                 the  game  session,  if matchmaking was used. Data is in JSON
                 syntax, formatted  as  a  string.  Information  includes  the
                 matchmaker  ID  as well as player attributes and team assign-
                 ments. For more details on matchmaker data, see Match Data  .
                 Matchmaker  data  is  updated  whenever new players are added
                 during a successful backfill (see StartMatchBackfill ).

              Location -> (string)
                 The fleet location where the game session  is  running.  This
                 value might specify the fleet's home Region or a remote loca-
                 tion. Location is expressed as an Amazon Web Services  Region
                 code such as us-west-2 .

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
