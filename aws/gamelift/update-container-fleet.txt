UPDATE-CONTAINER-FLEET()                              UPDATE-CONTAINER-FLEET()



NAME
       update-container-fleet -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  properties of a managed container fleet. Depending on the
       properties being updated, this operation might initiate a fleet deploy-
       ment. You can track deployments for a fleet using  DescribeFleetDeploy-
       ment .
          Request options

       As with CreateContainerFleet, many fleet properties use common defaults
       or are calculated based on the fleet's container group definitions.

       o Update  fleet  properties  that result in a fleet deployment. Include
         only those properties that you want  to  change.  Specify  deployment
         configuration settings.

       o Update  fleet properties that don't result in a fleet deployment. In-
         clude only those properties that you want to change.

       Changes to the following properties initiate a fleet deployment:

       o GameServerContainerGroupDefinition

       o PerInstanceContainerGroupDefinition

       o GameServerContainerGroupsPerInstance

       o InstanceInboundPermissions

       o InstanceConnectionPortRange

       o LogConfiguration
          Results

       If successful, this operation updates the container fleet resource, and
       might initiate a new deployment of fleet resources using the deployment
       configuration provided. A deployment replaces existing fleet  instances
       with new instances that are deployed with the updated fleet properties.
       The fleet is placed in UPDATING status until  the  deployment  is  com-
       plete, then return to ACTIVE .

       You  can  have only one update deployment active at a time for a fleet.
       If a second update request initiates a deployment while another deploy-
       ment is in progress, the first deployment is cancelled.

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the container fleet to update. You can use
          either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --game-server-container-group-definition-name (string)
          The name or ARN value of a new game server container  group  defini-
          tion  to deploy on the fleet. If you're updating the fleet to a spe-
          cific version of a container group definition, use the ARN value and
          include the version number. If you're updating the fleet to the lat-
          est version of a container group definition, you can  use  the  name
          value.  You can't remove a fleet's game server container group defi-
          nition, you can only update or replace it with another definition.

          Update a container group  definition  by  calling   UpdateContainer-
          GroupDefinition . This operation creates a  ContainerGroupDefinition
          resource with an incremented version.

       --per-instance-container-group-definition-name (string)
          The name or ARN value of a new per-instance container group  defini-
          tion  to deploy on the fleet. If you're updating the fleet to a spe-
          cific version of a container group definition, use the ARN value and
          include the version number. If you're updating the fleet to the lat-
          est version of a container group definition, you can  use  the  name
          value.

          Update  a  container  group  definition by calling  UpdateContainer-
          GroupDefinition . This operation creates a  ContainerGroupDefinition
          resource with an incremented version.

          To  remove  a fleet's per-instance container group definition, leave
          this parameter empty and use the parameter RemoveAttributes .

       --game-server-container-groups-per-instance (integer)
          The number of times to replicate the game server container group  on
          each fleet instance. By default, Amazon GameLift calculates the max-
          imum number of game server container groups that can fit on each in-
          stance.  You  can  remove  this property value to use the calculated
          value, or set it manually. If you set this number  manually,  Amazon
          GameLift  uses  your  value as long as it's less than the calculated
          maximum.

       --instance-connection-port-range (structure)
          A revised set of port numbers to open on each fleet instance. By de-
          fault,  Amazon  GameLift  calculates  an optimal port range based on
          your fleet configuration. If you previously set this parameter manu-
          ally, you can't reset this to use the calculated settings.

          FromPort -> (integer)
              Starting value for the port range.

          ToPort -> (integer)
              Ending  value for the port. Port numbers are end-inclusive. This
              value must be equal to or greater than FromPort .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FromPort=integer,ToPort=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FromPort": integer,
            "ToPort": integer
          }

       --instance-inbound-permission-authorizations (list)
          A set of ports to add to the container fleet's inbound permissions.

          (structure)
              A range of IP addresses and port  settings  that  allow  inbound
              traffic  to connect to processes on an instance in a fleet. Pro-
              cesses are assigned an IP address/port number combination, which
              must fall into the fleet's allowed ranges. For managed container
              fleets, the port settings must use the same port numbers as  the
              fleet's connection ports.

              For Realtime Servers fleets, Amazon GameLift automatically opens
              two port ranges, one for TCP messaging and one for UDP.

              FromPort -> (integer)
                 A starting value for a range of allowed port numbers.

                 For fleets using Linux builds, only ports 22  and  1026-60000
                 are valid.

                 For  fleets  using  Windows builds, only ports 1026-60000 are
                 valid.

              ToPort -> (integer)
                 An ending value for a range of  allowed  port  numbers.  Port
                 numbers  are  end-inclusive.  This  value must be equal to or
                 greater than FromPort .

                 For fleets using Linux builds, only ports 22  and  1026-60000
                 are valid.

                 For  fleets  using  Windows builds, only ports 1026-60000 are
                 valid.

              IpRange -> (string)
                 A range of allowed IP addresses. This value must be expressed
                 in  CIDR  notation. Example: "000.000.000.000/[subnet mask] "
                 or optionally the shortened version "0.0.0.0/[subnet mask] ".

              Protocol -> (string)
                 The network communication protocol used by the fleet.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FromPort=integer,ToPort=integer,IpRange=string,Protocol=string ...

              "IpRange": "string",
              "Protocol": "TCP"|"UDP"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --instance-inbound-permission-revocations (list)
          A set of ports to remove from the container fleet's inbound  permis-
          sions.

          (structure)
              A  range  of  IP  addresses and port settings that allow inbound
              traffic to connect to processes on an instance in a fleet.  Pro-
              cesses are assigned an IP address/port number combination, which
              must fall into the fleet's allowed ranges. For managed container
              fleets,  the port settings must use the same port numbers as the

                 For  fleets  using Linux builds, only ports 22 and 1026-60000
                 are valid.

                 For fleets using Windows builds, only  ports  1026-60000  are
                 valid.

              ToPort -> (integer)
                 An  ending  value  for  a range of allowed port numbers. Port
                 numbers are end-inclusive. This value must  be  equal  to  or

                 valid.

              IpRange -> (string)
                 A range of allowed IP addresses. This value must be expressed
                 in CIDR notation. Example: "000.000.000.000/[subnet  mask]  "
                 or optionally the shortened version "0.0.0.0/[subnet mask] ".

              Protocol -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FromPort=integer,ToPort=integer,IpRange=string,Protocol=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

            }
            ...
          ]

       --deployment-configuration (structure)
          Instructions  for how to deploy updates to a container fleet, if the
          fleet update initiates a deployment.  The  deployment  configuration
          lets  you  determine how to replace fleet instances and what actions
          to take if the deployment fails.

          ProtectionStrategy -> (string)
              Determines how fleet deployment  activity  affects  active  game
              sessions on the fleet. With protection, a deployment honors game
              session protection, and delays actions that  would  interrupt  a
              protected active game session until the game session ends. With-
              out protection, deployment activity can shut  down  all  running
              tasks,  including  active game sessions, regardless of game ses-
              sion protection.

          MinimumHealthyPercentage -> (integer)
              Sets a minimum level of healthy tasks to maintain during deploy-
              ment activity.

          ImpairmentStrategy -> (string)
              Determines  what  actions  to take if a deployment fails. If the
              fleet is multi-location, this strategy applies across all  fleet
              locations. With a rollback strategy, updated fleet instances are
              rolled back to the last  successful  deployment.  Alternatively,
              you  can  maintain  a few impaired containers for the purpose of
              debugging, while all other tasks return to the  last  successful
              deployment.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ProtectionStrategy=string,MinimumHealthyPercentage=integer,ImpairmentStrategy=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ProtectionStrategy": "WITH_PROTECTION"|"IGNORE_PROTECTION",
            "MinimumHealthyPercentage": integer,
            "ImpairmentStrategy": "MAINTAIN"|"ROLLBACK"
          }

       --description (string)
          A meaningful description of the container fleet.

       --metric-groups (list)
          The  name  of  an Amazon Web Services CloudWatch metric group to add
          this fleet to.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --new-game-session-protection-policy (string)
          The game session protection policy to apply to all new game sessions
          that are started in this fleet. Game sessions that already exist are
          not affected.

          Possible values:

          o NoProtection

          o FullProtection

       --game-session-creation-limit-policy (structure)
          A policy that limits the number of game sessions that each  individ-
          ual  player can create on instances in this fleet. The limit applies
          for a specified span of time.

          NewGameSessionsPerCreator -> (integer)
              A policy that puts limits on the number of game sessions that  a
              player  can  create  within  a specified span of time. With this
              policy, you can control players' ability  to  consume  available
              resources.

              The  policy  evaluates  when a player tries to create a new game
              session.  On  receiving  a  CreateGameSession  request,   Amazon
              GameLift  checks  that the player (identified by CreatorId ) has
              created fewer than game session limit in the specified time  pe-
              riod.

          PolicyPeriodInMinutes -> (integer)
              The  time  span  used  in evaluating the resource creation limit
              policy.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NewGameSessionsPerCreator=integer,PolicyPeriodInMinutes=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "NewGameSessionsPerCreator": integer,
            "PolicyPeriodInMinutes": integer
          }

       --log-configuration (structure)
          The method for collecting container logs for the fleet.

          LogDestination -> (string)
              The type of log collection to use for a fleet.

              o CLOUDWATCH -- (default value) Send logs to  an  Amazon  Cloud-
                Watch  log  group  that you define. Each container emits a log
                stream, which is organized in the log group.

              o S3 -- Store logs in an Amazon S3 bucket that you define.

              o NONE -- Don't collect container logs.

          S3BucketName -> (string)
              If log destination is S3 , logs are sent to the specified Amazon
              S3 bucket name.

          LogGroupArn -> (string)
              If  log  destination is CLOUDWATCH , logs are sent to the speci-
              fied log group in Amazon CloudWatch.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          LogDestination=string,S3BucketName=string,LogGroupArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "LogDestination": "NONE"|"CLOUDWATCH"|"S3",
            "S3BucketName": "string",
            "LogGroupArn": "string"
          }

       --remove-attributes (list)
          If set, this update removes a fleet's per-instance  container  group
          definition.  You  can't remove a fleet's game server container group
          definition.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            PER_INSTANCE_CONTAINER_GROUP_DEFINITION

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ContainerFleet -> (structure)
          A collection of container fleet objects for all  fleets  that  match
          the request criteria.

          InstanceConnectionPortRange -> (structure)
              The set of port numbers to open on each instance in a  container
              fleet.  Connection  ports are used by inbound traffic to connect
              with processes that are running in containers on the fleet.

              FromPort -> (integer)
                 Starting value for the port range.

              ToPort -> (integer)
                 Ending value for the port. Port  numbers  are  end-inclusive.

                 A  range of IP addresses and port settings that allow inbound
                 traffic to connect to processes on an instance  in  a  fleet.
                 Processes are assigned an IP address/port number combination,
                 which must fall into the fleet's allowed ranges. For  managed
                 container  fleets,  the  port settings must use the same port
                 numbers as the fleet's connection ports.

                 For Realtime Servers fleets,  Amazon  GameLift  automatically
                 opens two port ranges, one for TCP messaging and one for UDP.

                 FromPort -> (integer)
                     A starting value for a range of allowed port numbers.

              on each fleet instance.

          MaximumGameServerContainerGroupsPerInstance -> (integer)
              The  calculated  maximum  number  of game server container group
              that can be deployed on each fleet instance. The calculation de-
              pends  on  the resource needs of the container group and the CPU
              and memory resources of the fleet's instance type.

          InstanceType -> (string)
              The Amazon EC2 instance type to use for  all  instances  in  the
              fleet. Instance type determines the computing resources and pro-
              cessing power that's available to host your game  servers.  This
              includes  including  CPU, memory, storage, and networking capac-
              ity. You can't update this fleet property.

          BillingType -> (string)

              (string)

          NewGameSessionProtectionPolicy -> (string)
              Determines whether Amazon GameLift can shut down  game  sessions
              on the fleet that are actively running and hosting players. Ama-
              zon GameLift might prompt an instance shutdown when scaling down
              fleet  capacity  or  when  retiring unhealthy instances. You can
              also set game session protection for  individual  game  sessions
              using UpdateGameSession .

              o NoProtection  --  Game sessions can be shut down during active
                gameplay.

                down.

          GameSessionCreationLimitPolicy -> (structure)
              A policy that limits the number of game sessions that each indi-
              vidual player can create on instances in this fleet.  The  limit
              applies for a specified span of time.

              NewGameSessionsPerCreator -> (integer)
                 A policy that puts limits on the number of game sessions that
                 a player can create within a specified  span  of  time.  With
                 this  policy,  you  can  control  players' ability to consume
                 available resources.

                 The policy evaluates when a player tries to create a new game
                 session.  On  receiving  a  CreateGameSession request, Amazon
                 GameLift checks that the player (identified  by  CreatorId  )
                 has  created  fewer  than game session limit in the specified
                 time period.

              PolicyPeriodInMinutes -> (integer)
