DELETE-GAME-SERVER-GROUP()                          DELETE-GAME-SERVER-GROUP()



NAME
       delete-game-server-group -

DESCRIPTION
          This  operation  is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game
          server groups.

       Terminates a game server group and permanently deletes the game  server
       group  record. You have several options for how these resources are im-
       pacted when deleting the game server group. Depending on  the  type  of
       delete operation selected, this operation might affect these resources:

       o The game server group

       o The corresponding Auto Scaling group

       o All game servers that are currently running in the group

       To delete a game server group, identify the game server group to delete
       and specify the type of  delete  operation  to  initiate.  Game  server
       groups can only be deleted if they are in ACTIVE or ERROR status.

       If  the delete request is successful, a series of operations are kicked
       off. The game server group status  is  changed  to  DELETE_SCHEDULED  ,
       which  prevents  new game servers from being registered and stops auto-
       matic scaling activity. Once all game servers in the game server  group
       are deregistered, GameLift FleetIQ can begin deleting resources. If any
       of the delete operations fail, the game server group is placed in ERROR
       status.

       GameLift FleetIQ emits delete events to Amazon CloudWatch.

OPTIONS
       --game-server-group-name (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the game server group. Use either the name
          or ARN value.

       --delete-option (string)
          The type of delete to perform. Options include the following:

          o SAFE_DELETE  (default) Terminates the game server group and Amazon
            EC2  Auto  Scaling group only when it has no game servers that are
            in UTILIZED status.

          o FORCE_DELETE  Terminates the game server group, including all  ac-
            tive  game servers regardless of their utilization status, and the
            Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group.

          o RETAIN  Does a safe delete of the game server  group  but  retains
            the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group as is.

          Possible values:

          o SAFE_DELETE

          o FORCE_DELETE

          o RETAIN

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GameServerGroup -> (structure)
          An object that describes the deleted  game  server  group  resource,
          with status updated to DELETE_SCHEDULED .

          GameServerGroupName -> (string)
              A  developer-defined  identifier  for the game server group. The
              name is unique for each Region in each Amazon Web  Services  ac-
              count.

          GameServerGroupArn -> (string)
              A generated unique ID for the game server group.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role that allows Ama-
              zon GameLift to access your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups.

          InstanceDefinitions -> (list)
              The set of Amazon EC2 instance types that GameLift  FleetIQ  can
              use  when  balancing  and automatically scaling instances in the
              corresponding Auto Scaling group.

              (structure)
                     This data type is used with the GameLift FleetIQ and game
                     server groups.

                 An  allowed  instance  type for a game server group. All game
                 server groups must have at least two instance  types  defined
                 for  it. GameLift FleetIQ periodically evaluates each defined
                 instance type for viability. It then updates the Auto Scaling
                 group with the list of viable instance types.

                 InstanceType -> (string)
                     An Amazon EC2 instance type designation.

                 WeightedCapacity -> (string)
                     Instance  weighting that indicates how much this instance
                     type contributes to the total capacity of a  game  server
                     group.  Instance  weights are used by GameLift FleetIQ to
                     calculate the instance type's cost per unit hour and bet-
                     ter  identify  the  most  cost-effective options. For de-
                     tailed information on weighting  instance  capacity,  see
                     Instance  Weighting  in  the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
                     Auto Scaling User Guide . Default value is "1".

          BalancingStrategy -> (string)
              Indicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances  the  use  of  Spot  In-
              stances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method
              options include the following:

              o SPOT_ONLY - Only Spot Instances are used in  the  game  server
                group.  If  Spot  Instances  are unavailable or not viable for
                game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capac-
                ity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new
                instances are started, and the  existing  nonviable  Spot  In-
                stances  are  terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are
                not replaced.

              o SPOT_PREFERRED - (default value) Spot Instances are used when-
                ever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are
                unavailable, the game server group continues to provide  host-
                ing  capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing
                nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after  current  game-
                play ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances.

              o ON_DEMAND_ONLY - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game
                server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available,
                while this balancing strategy is in force.

          GameServerProtectionPolicy -> (string)
              A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group
              are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that
              have  active  game  servers running might be terminated during a
              scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from  the  game.
              Protected  instances cannot be terminated while there are active
              game servers running except in the event of a forced game server
              group  deletion  (see  ).  An exception to this is with Spot In-
              stances, which can be terminated by Amazon Web Services  regard-
              less of protection status.

          AutoScalingGroupArn -> (string)
              A generated unique ID for the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group that
              is associated with this game server group.

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of the game server group.  Possible  statuses
              include:

              o NEW  -  GameLift  FleetIQ  has validated the CreateGameServer-
                Group() request.

              o ACTIVATING - GameLift FleetIQ is  setting  up  a  game  server
                group,  which  includes creating an Auto Scaling group in your
                Amazon Web Services account.

              o ACTIVE - The game server group has been successfully created.

              o DELETE_SCHEDULED - A request to delete the game  server  group
                has been received.

              o DELETING  -  GameLift FleetIQ has received a valid DeleteGame-
                ServerGroup() request and is processing it.  GameLift  FleetIQ
                must  first  complete  and release hosts before it deletes the
                Auto Scaling group and the game server group.

              o DELETED - The game server group has been successfully deleted.

              o ERROR - The asynchronous processes of activating or deleting a
                game server group has failed, resulting in an error state.

          StatusReason -> (string)
              Additional  information about the current game server group sta-
              tus. This information might provide additional insight on groups
              that are in ERROR status.

          SuspendedActions -> (list)
              A  list of activities that are currently suspended for this game
              server group. If this property is empty, all activities are  oc-
              curring.

              (string)

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A  time stamp indicating when this data object was created. For-
              mat is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for  ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
              A  timestamp that indicates when this game server group was last
              updated.
