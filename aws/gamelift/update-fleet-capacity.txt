UPDATE-FLEET-CAPACITY()                                UPDATE-FLEET-CAPACITY()



NAME
       update-fleet-capacity -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  capacity  settings for a fleet. For fleets with multiple loca-
       tions, use this operation to manage capacity settings in each  location
       individually. Fleet capacity determines the number of game sessions and
       players that can be hosted based on the fleet configuration.  Use  this
       operation to set the following fleet capacity properties:

       o Minimum/maximum  size:  Set  hard  limits on fleet capacity. GameLift
         cannot set the fleet's capacity to a value  outside  of  this  range,
         whether  the  capacity is changed manually or through automatic scal-
         ing.

       o Desired capacity: Manually set the number of Amazon EC2 instances  to
         be  maintained in a fleet location. Before changing a fleet's desired
         capacity, you may want to call  DescribeEC2InstanceLimits to get  the
         maximum  capacity  of  the fleet's Amazon EC2 instance type. Alterna-
         tively, consider using automatic scaling to adjust capacity based  on
         player demand.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To  update capacity for a fleet's home Region, or if the fleet has no
         remote locations, omit the Location parameter. The fleet must  be  in
         ACTIVE status.

       o To  update  capacity for a fleet's remote location, include the Loca-
         tion parameter set to the location to be updated. The  location  must
         be in ACTIVE status.

       If successful, capacity settings are updated immediately. In response a
       change in desired capacity, GameLift initiates steps to start  new  in-
       stances  or  terminate  existing instances in the requested fleet loca-
       tion. This continues until the location's active instance count matches
       the  new desired instance count. You can track a fleet's current capac-
       ity by calling  DescribeFleetCapacity or  DescribeFleetLocationCapacity
       .  If  the requested desired instance count is higher than the instance
       type's limit, the LimitExceeded exception occurs.

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to update capacity  settings  for.
          You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --desired-instances (integer)
          The number of Amazon EC2 instances you want to maintain in the spec-
          ified fleet location. This value must fall between the  minimum  and
          maximum size limits.

       --min-size (integer)
          The  minimum  number  of instances that are allowed in the specified
          fleet location. If this parameter is not set, the default is 0.

       --max-size (integer)
          The maximum number of instances that are allowed  in  the  specified
          fleet location. If this parameter is not set, the default is 1.

       --location (string)
          The name of a remote location to update fleet capacity settings for,
          in the form of an Amazon Web Services Region code such as  us-west-2
          .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that was updated.

       FleetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift fleet
          resource  and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Re-
          gions.           Format           is           arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
          gion>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .
