UPDATE-FLEET-CAPACITY()                                UPDATE-FLEET-CAPACITY()



NAME
       update-fleet-capacity -

DESCRIPTION
          This  operation  has  been  expanded to use with the Amazon GameLift
          containers feature, which is currently in public preview.

       Updates capacity settings for a managed EC2 fleet or  container  fleet.
       For  these  fleets,  you  adjust capacity by changing the number of in-
       stances in the fleet. Fleet capacity determines the number of game ses-
       sions  and  players that the fleet can host based on its configuration.
       For fleets with multiple locations, use this operation to manage capac-
       ity settings in each location individually.

       Use this operation to set these fleet capacity properties:

       o Minimum/maximum size: Set hard limits on the number of Amazon EC2 in-
         stances  allowed.  If  Amazon  GameLift  receives  a  request--either
         through  manual  update or automatic scaling--it won't change the ca-
         pacity to a value outside of this range.

       o Desired capacity: As an alternative to  automatic  scaling,  manually
         set  the  number  of  Amazon  EC2  instances to be maintained. Before
         changing a fleet's desired capacity, check the  maximum  capacity  of
         the     fleet's    Amazon    EC2    instance    type    by    calling
         DescribeEC2InstanceLimits .

       To update capacity for a fleet's home Region, or if the  fleet  has  no
       remote locations, omit the Location parameter. The fleet must be in AC-
       TIVE status.

       To update capacity for a fleet's remote location, set the Location  pa-
       rameter  to the location to update. The location must be in ACTIVE sta-
       tus.

       If successful, Amazon GameLift updates the capacity  settings  and  re-
       turns  the  identifiers for the updated fleet and/or location. If a re-
       quested change to desired capacity exceeds the instance  type's  limit,
       the LimitExceeded exception occurs.

       Updates  often  prompt  an  immediate change in fleet capacity, such as
       when current capacity is different than the  new  desired  capacity  or
       outside the new limits. In this scenario, Amazon GameLift automatically
       initiates steps to add or remove instances in the fleet  location.  You
       can  track  a fleet's current capacity by calling DescribeFleetCapacity
       or DescribeFleetLocationCapacity .

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to update capacity  settings  for.
          You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --desired-instances (integer)
          The number of Amazon EC2 instances you want to maintain in the spec-
          ified fleet location. This value must fall between the  minimum  and
          maximum  size  limits. Changes in desired instance value can take up
          to 1 minute to be reflected when viewing the fleet's  capacity  set-
          tings.

       --min-size (integer)
          The  minimum  number  of instances that are allowed in the specified
          fleet location. If this parameter is not set, the default is 0.

       --max-size (integer)
          The maximum number of instances that are allowed  in  the  specified
          fleet location. If this parameter is not set, the default is 1.

       --location (string)
          The name of a remote location to update fleet capacity settings for,
          in the form of an Amazon Web Services Region code such as  us-west-2
          .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that was updated.

       FleetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN  )  that  is  assigned  to  a  Amazon
          GameLift  fleet resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique
          across    all    Regions.    Format     is     arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
          gion>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .

       Location -> (string)
          The  remote  location being updated, expressed as an Amazon Web Ser-
          vices Region code, such as us-west-2 .
