DESCRIBE-SCALING-POLICIES()                        DESCRIBE-SCALING-POLICIES()



NAME
       describe-scaling-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves all scaling policies applied to a fleet.

       To get a fleet's scaling policies, specify the fleet ID. You can filter
       this request by policy status, such as to retrieve only active  scaling
       policies. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of
       sequential pages. If successful, set of ScalingPolicy  objects  is  re-
       turned for the fleet.

       A  fleet may have all of its scaling policies suspended. This operation
       does not affect the status of the scaling policies, which  remains  AC-
       TIVE.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-scaling-policies  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: ScalingPolicies

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet  for  which  to  retrieve  scaling
          policies. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --status-filter (string)
          Scaling policy status to filter results on. A scaling policy is only
          in force when in an ACTIVE status.

          o ACTIVE -- The scaling policy is currently in force.

          o UPDATEREQUESTED -- A request to update the scaling policy has been
            received.

          o UPDATING -- A change is being made to the scaling policy.

          o DELETEREQUESTED -- A request to delete the scaling policy has been
            received.

          o DELETING -- The scaling policy is being deleted.

          o DELETED -- The scaling policy has been deleted.

          o ERROR -- An error occurred in creating the policy.  It  should  be
            removed and recreated.

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o UPDATE_REQUESTED

          o UPDATING

          o DELETE_REQUESTED

          o DELETING

          o DELETED

          o ERROR

       --location (string)
          The  fleet  location.  If you don't specify this value, the response
          contains the scaling policies of every location in the fleet.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          request.

          (structure)
              Rule  that  controls how a fleet is scaled. Scaling policies are
              uniquely identified by the combination of name and fleet ID.

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the fleet  that  is  associated  with
                 this scaling policy.

                 A descriptive label that is associated with a fleet's scaling
                 policy. Policy names do not need to be unique.

              Status -> (string)
                 Current  status of the scaling policy. The scaling policy can
                 be in force only when in an ACTIVE status.  Scaling  policies
                 can be suspended for individual fleets. If the policy is sus-
                 pended for a fleet, the policy status does not change.

                 o ACTIVE -- The scaling policy can be used for auto-scaling a
                   fleet.

                 o UPDATE_REQUESTED  -- A request to update the scaling policy
                   has been received.

                 o DELETE_REQUESTED -- A request to delete the scaling  policy
                   has been received.

                 o DELETING -- The scaling policy is being deleted.

                 o DELETED -- The scaling policy has been deleted.

                 o ERROR  --  An  error  occurred  in  creating the policy. It
                   should be removed and recreated.

                 The type of adjustment to make to a fleet's instance count.

                 o ChangeInCapacity  --  add (or subtract) the scaling adjust-
                   ment value from the current instance count. Positive values
                   scale up while negative values scale down.

                 o ExactCapacity  -- set the instance count to the scaling ad-
                   justment value.

                 o PercentChangeInCapacity -- increase or reduce  the  current
                   instance  count  by  the scaling adjustment, read as a per-
                   centage. Positive values scale  up  while  negative  values
                   scale down.

              ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                 Comparison  operator  to  use when measuring a metric against
                 the threshold value.

              Threshold -> (double)
                 Metric value used to trigger a scaling event.

              EvaluationPeriods -> (integer)
                 Length of time (in minutes) the metric must be at  or  beyond
                 the threshold before a scaling event is triggered.

              MetricName -> (string)
                 Name  of  the  Amazon GameLift-defined metric that is used to
                 trigger a scaling adjustment. For  detailed  descriptions  of
                 fleet metrics, see Monitor Amazon GameLift with Amazon Cloud-
                 Watch .

                 o ActivatingGameSessions -- Game sessions in the  process  of
                   being created.

                 o ActiveGameSessions -- Game sessions that are currently run-
                   ning.

                 o ActiveInstances -- Fleet instances that are currently  run-
                   ning at least one game session.

                 o AvailableGameSessions  --  Additional  game  sessions  that
                   fleet could host simultaneously, given current capacity.

                 o AvailablePlayerSessions -- Empty player slots in  currently
                   active  game sessions. This includes game sessions that are
                   not currently accepting players. Reserved player slots  are
                   not included.

                 o CurrentPlayerSessions  --  Player slots in active game ses-
                   sions that are being used by a player or are reserved for a
                   player.

                 o IdleInstances  -- Active instances that are currently host-
                   ing zero game sessions.

                 o PercentAvailableGameSessions -- Unused  percentage  of  the
                   total  number  of game sessions that a fleet could host si-
                   multaneously, given current capacity. Use this metric for a
                   target-based scaling policy.

                 o PercentIdleInstances  --  Percentage of the total number of
                   active instances that are hosting zero game sessions.

                 o QueueDepth -- Pending game session placement  requests,  in
                   any queue, where the current fleet is the top-priority des-
                   tination.

                 o WaitTime -- Current wait  time  for  pending  game  session
                   placement  requests,  in any queue, where the current fleet
                   is the top-priority destination.

              PolicyType -> (string)
                 The type of scaling policy to create. For a target-based pol-
                 icy,  set  the parameter MetricName to 'PercentAvailableGame-
                 Sessions'  and  specify  a  TargetConfiguration   .   For   a
                 rule-based  policy set the following parameters: MetricName ,
                 ComparisonOperator , Threshold , EvaluationPeriods ,  Scalin-
                 gAdjustmentType , and ScalingAdjustment .

              TargetConfiguration -> (structure)
                 An  object  that contains settings for a target-based scaling
                 policy.

                 TargetValue -> (double)
                     Desired value to use with a target-based scaling  policy.
                     The  value must be relevant for whatever metric the scal-
                     ing policy is using. For example, in a policy  using  the
                     metric  PercentAvailableGameSessions,  the  target  value
                     should be the preferred size of the fleet's  buffer  (the
                     percent of capacity that should be idle and ready for new
                     game sessions).

              UpdateStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of the fleet's scaling policies in  a  re-
                 quested  fleet  location. The status PENDING_UPDATE indicates
                 that an update was requested for the fleet but  has  not  yet
                 been completed for the location.

              Location -> (string)
                 The fleet location.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
