NAME
       update-alias -

OPTIONS
       --alias-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the alias that you want to update.  You  can
          use either the alias ID or ARN value.

       --name (string)
          A descriptive label that is associated with an alias. Alias names do
          not need to be unique.

       --description (string)
          A human-readable description of the alias.

       --routing-strategy (structure)
          The routing configuration, including routing type and fleet  target,
          for the alias.

          Type -> (string)
              The type of routing strategy for the alias.

              Possible routing types include the following:

              o SIMPLE  -  The  alias resolves to one specific fleet. Use this
                type when routing to active fleets.

              o TERMINAL - The alias does not resolve to a fleet  but  instead
                can be used to display a message to the user. A terminal alias
                throws a TerminalRoutingStrategyException with the message em-
                bedded.

          FleetId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the fleet that the alias points to. This
              value is the fleet ID, not the fleet ARN.

          Message -> (string)
              The message text to be used with a terminal routing strategy.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,FleetId=string,Message=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Type": "SIMPLE"|"TERMINAL",
            "FleetId": "string",
            "Message": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Alias -> (structure)
          The updated alias resource.

          AliasId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the alias. Alias IDs are unique within a
              Region.

          Name -> (string)
              A  descriptive  label  that  is  associated with an alias. Alias
              names do not need to be unique.

          AliasArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is  assigned  to  a  Amazon
              GameLift  alias  resource  and  uniquely identifies it. ARNs are
              unique  across  all  Regions.  Format  is  arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
              gion>::alias/alias-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912  .  In a
              GameLift alias ARN, the resource ID matches the alias ID value.

          Description -> (string)
              A human-readable description of an alias.

          RoutingStrategy -> (structure)
              The routing configuration, including routing type and fleet tar-
              get, for the alias.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of routing strategy for the alias.

                 Possible routing types include the following:

                 o SIMPLE - The alias resolves to one specific fleet. Use this
                   type when routing to active fleets.

                 o TERMINAL - The alias does not resolve to a  fleet  but  in-
                   stead  can be used to display a message to the user. A ter-
                   minal alias throws a TerminalRoutingStrategyException  with
                   the message embedded.

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier for the fleet that the alias points to.
                 This value is the fleet ID, not the fleet ARN.

              Message -> (string)
                 The message text to be used with a terminal routing strategy.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A time stamp indicating when this data object was created.  For-
              mat  is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that this data object was last modified.  Format  is  a
              number  expressed  in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds (for example
              "1469498468.057" ).
