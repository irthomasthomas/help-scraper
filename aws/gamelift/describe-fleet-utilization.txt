DESCRIBE-FLEET-UTILIZATION()                      DESCRIBE-FLEET-UTILIZATION()



NAME
       describe-fleet-utilization -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  utilization  statistics  for one or more fleets. Utilization
       data provides a snapshot of how the fleet's hosting resources are  cur-
       rently being used. For fleets with remote locations, this operation re-
       trieves   data   for   the    fleet's    home    Region    only.    See
       DescribeFleetLocationUtilization  to  get  utilization statistics for a
       fleet's remote locations.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To get utilization data for one or more specific  fleets,  provide  a
         list of fleet IDs or fleet ARNs.

       o To  get utilization data for all fleets, do not provide a fleet iden-
         tifier.

       When requesting multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters  to  re-
       trieve results as a set of sequential pages.

       If successful, a FleetUtilization object is returned for each requested
       fleet ID, unless the fleet identifier is not found. Each fleet utiliza-
       tion  object  includes a Location property, which is set to the fleet's
       home Region.

       NOTE:
              Some API operations may limit the number of fleet IDs allowed in
              one  request. If a request exceeds this limit, the request fails
              and the error message includes the maximum allowed.

       describe-fleet-utilization is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: FleetUtilization

OPTIONS
       --fleet-ids (list)
          A  unique identifier for the fleet to retrieve utilization data for.
          You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. To retrieve attributes
          for all current fleets, do not include this parameter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example1: To view usage data for a list of fleets

       The following describe-fleet-utilization example retrieves current  us-
       age information for one specified fleet.

          aws gamelift describe-fleet-utilization \
              --fleet-ids arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::fleet/fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "FleetUtilization": [
                  {
                  "FleetId": "fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "ActiveServerProcessCount": 100,
                  "ActiveGameSessionCount": 62,
                  "CurrentPlayerSessionCount": 329,
                  "MaximumPlayerSessionCount": 1000
                  }
              ]
          }

       Example2: To request usage data for all fleets

       The  following  describe-fleet-utilization returns fleet usage data for
       all fleets with any status. This example uses pagination parameters  to
       return data for two fleets at a time.

          aws gamelift describe-fleet-utilization \
              --limit 2

       Output:

          {
              "FleetUtilization": [
                  {
                      "FleetId": "fleet-1111aaaa-22bb-33cc-44dd-5555eeee66ff",
                      "ActiveServerProcessCount": 100,
                      "ActiveGameSessionCount": 13,
                      "CurrentPlayerSessionCount": 98,
                      "MaximumPlayerSessionCount": 1000
                  },
                  {
                      "FleetId": "fleet-2222bbbb-33cc-44dd-55ee-6666ffff77aa",
                      "ActiveServerProcessCount": 100,
                      "ActiveGameSessionCount": 62,
                      "CurrentPlayerSessionCount": 329,
                      "MaximumPlayerSessionCount": 1000
                  }
              ],
              "NextToken": "eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC01NWYxZTZmMS1jY2FlLTQ3YTctOWI5ZS1iYjFkYTQwMjEXAMPLE2"
          }

       Call  the command a second time, passing the NextToken value as the ar-
       gument to the --next-token parameter to see the next two results.

          aws gamelift describe-fleet-utilization \
              --limit 2 \
              --next-token eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC01NWYxZTZmMS1jY2FlLTQ3YTctOWI5ZS1iYjFkYTQwMjEXAMPLE2

       Repeat until the response no longer includes a NextToken value  in  the
       output.
