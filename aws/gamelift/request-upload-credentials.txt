REQUEST-UPLOAD-CREDENTIALS()                      REQUEST-UPLOAD-CREDENTIALS()



NAME
       request-upload-credentials -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  fresh set of credentials for use when uploading a new set
       of game build files to Amazon GameLift's Amazon S3.  This  is  done  as
       part of the build creation process; see CreateBuild .

       To  request  new  credentials, specify the build ID as returned with an
       initial CreateBuild request. If successful, a new  set  of  credentials
       are  returned,  along  with the S3 storage location associated with the
       build ID.

SYNOPSIS

          --build-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]

          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]

OPTIONS
       --build-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the build to get credentials  for.  You  can
          use either the build ID or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To refresh access credentials for uploading a build

       The following create-build example obtains new,  valid  access  creden-
       tials  for  uploading  a  GameLift build file to an Amazon S3 location.
       Credentials have a limited life span. You get the build ID from the re-
       sponse to the original CreateBuild request.

          aws gamelift request-upload-credentials \
              --build-id build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "StorageLocation": {
                  "Bucket": "gamelift-builds-us-west-2",
                  "Key": "123456789012/build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"

              }

OUTPUT
       UploadCredentials -> (structure)
          Amazon Web Services credentials required when uploading a game build
          to  the  storage location. These credentials have a limited lifespan
          and are valid only for the build they were issued for.

          AccessKeyId -> (string)
              The access key ID that identifies the temporary security creden-
              tials.

          SecretAccessKey -> (string)
              The secret access key that can be used to sign requests.

          SessionToken -> (string)
              The  token  that  users  must pass to the service API to use the
              temporary credentials.

       StorageLocation -> (structure)
          Amazon S3 path and key, identifying where the game build  files  are
          stored.

          Bucket -> (string)
              An Amazon S3 bucket identifier. Thename of the S3 bucket.

              NOTE:
                 Amazon  GameLift  doesn't  support  uploading  from Amazon S3
                 buckets with names that contain a dot (.).

          Key -> (string)
              The name of the zip file that contains the build files or script
              files.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role that allows Ama-
              zon GameLift to access the S3 bucket.

          ObjectVersion -> (string)
              The version of the file, if object versioning is turned  on  for
              the  bucket. Amazon GameLift uses this information when retriev-
              ing files from an S3 bucket that you own. Use this parameter  to
              specify  a  specific version of the file. If not set, the latest
              version of the file is retrieved.
