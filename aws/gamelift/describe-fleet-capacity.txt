DESCRIBE-FLEET-CAPACITY()                            DESCRIBE-FLEET-CAPACITY()



NAME
       describe-fleet-capacity -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  resource  capacity settings for one or more fleets. The
       data returned includes the current fleet capacity (number  of  EC2  in-
       stances),  and  settings  that  can  control  how capacity scaling. For
       fleets with remote locations, this operation  retrieves  data  for  the
       fleet's home Region only.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To  get capacity data for one or more specific fleets, provide a list
         of fleet IDs or fleet ARNs.

       o To get capacity data for all fleets, do not provide a  fleet  identi-
         fier.

       When  requesting  multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters to re-
       trieve results as a set of sequential pages.

       If successful, a FleetCapacity object is returned  for  each  requested
       fleet ID. Each FleetCapacity object includes a Location property, which
       is set to the fleet's home Region. When a list of  fleet  IDs  is  pro-
       vided,  attribute  objects  are returned only for fleets that currently
       exist.

       NOTE:
              Some API operations may limit the number of fleet IDs  that  are
              allowed in one request. If a request exceeds this limit, the re-
              quest fails and the error message includes the maximum allowed.

       describe-fleet-capacity is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: FleetCapacity

OPTIONS
       --fleet-ids (list)
          A  unique  identifier for the fleet to retrieve capacity information
          for. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. Leave this param-
          eter empty to retrieve capacity information for all fleets.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       FleetCapacity -> (list)
          A collection of objects that contains capacity information for  each
          requested  fleet  ID.  Capacity objects are returned only for fleets
          that currently exist.

          (structure)
              Current resource capacity settings in a specified fleet or loca-
              tion.  The  location value might refer to a fleet's remote loca-
              tion or its home Region.

                 UpdateFleetCapacity

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier for the fleet associated with the loca-
                 tion.

              FleetArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN  )  that  is  assigned  to  a
                 GameLift  fleet resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are
                 unique across all Regions.  Format  is  arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
                 gion>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .

              InstanceType -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  EC2 instance type that is used for all instances
                 in a fleet. The instance type determines  the  computing  re-
                 sources  in use, including CPU, memory, storage, and network-
                 ing capacity. See Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Instance Types
                 for detailed descriptions.

              InstanceCounts -> (structure)
                 Resource  capacity  settings.  Fleet  capacity is measured in
                 Amazon EC2 instances.  Pending  and  terminating  counts  are
                 non-zero  when  the  fleet capacity is adjusting to a scaling
                 event or if access to resources is temporarily affected.

                 DESIRED -> (integer)
                     Ideal number of active instances.  GameLift  will  always
                     try to maintain the desired number of instances. Capacity
                     is scaled up or down by changing the desired instances.

                 MINIMUM -> (integer)
                     The minimum instance count value allowed.

                 MAXIMUM -> (integer)
                     The maximum instance count value allowed.

                 PENDING -> (integer)
                     Number of instances that are starting but not yet active.

                 ACTIVE -> (integer)
                     Actual number of instances that are ready  to  host  game
                     sessions.

                 IDLE -> (integer)
                     Number of active instances that are not currently hosting
                     a game session.

                 TERMINATING -> (integer)
                     Number of instances that are no longer active but haven't
                     yet been terminated.

              Location -> (string)
                 The  fleet  location  for the instance count information, ex-
                 pressed as an  Amazon  Web  Services  Region  code,  such  as
                 us-west-2 .

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
