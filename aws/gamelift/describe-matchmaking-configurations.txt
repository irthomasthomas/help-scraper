NAME
       describe-matchmaking-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the details of FlexMatch matchmaking configurations.

       This operation offers the following options: (1) retrieve all matchmak-
       ing configurations, (2) retrieve configurations for a  specified  list,
       or  (3) retrieve all configurations that use a specified rule set name.
       When requesting multiple items, use the pagination  parameters  to  re-
       trieve results as a set of sequential pages.

       If  successful,  a  configuration  is returned for each requested name.
       When specifying a list of names, only configurations that currently ex-
       ist are returned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-matchmaking-configurations  is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: Configurations

OPTIONS
       --names (list)
          A unique identifier for  the  matchmaking  configuration(s)  to  re-
          trieve.  You  can use either the configuration name or ARN value. To
          request all existing configurations, leave this parameter empty.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --rule-set-name (string)
          A unique identifier for the matchmaking rule set. You can use either
          the  rule  set name or ARN value. Use this parameter to retrieve all
          matchmaking configurations that use this rule set.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Configurations -> (list)
          A collection of requested matchmaking configurations.

          (structure)
              Guidelines  for  use with FlexMatch to match players into games.
              All matchmaking requests must specify a  matchmaking  configura-
              tion.

              Name -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier for the matchmaking configuration. This
                 name is used to identify the configuration associated with  a
                 matchmaking request or ticket.

              ConfigurationArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a Amazon
                 GameLift  matchmaking  configuration  resource  and  uniquely
                 identifies  it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is
                 arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::matchmakingconfiguration/<match-
                 making  configuration name> . In a Amazon GameLift configura-
                 tion ARN, the resource ID matches the Name value.

              Description -> (string)
                 A descriptive label that is associated with matchmaking  con-
                 figuration.

              GameSessionQueueArns -> (list)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a Amazon
                 GameLift game session queue resource and uniquely  identifies
                 it.   ARNs   are   unique   across  all  Regions.  Format  is
                 arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesessionqueue/<queue  name>   .
                 Queues can be located in any Region. Queues are used to start
                 new Amazon GameLift-hosted game sessions for matches that are
                 created with this matchmaking configuration. This property is
                 not set when FlexMatchMode is set to STANDALONE .

                 (string)

              RequestTimeoutSeconds -> (integer)
                 The maximum duration, in seconds, that a  matchmaking  ticket
                 can  remain  in process before timing out. Requests that fail
                 due to timing out can be resubmitted as needed.

              AcceptanceTimeoutSeconds -> (integer)
                 The length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept
                 a  proposed  match,  if acceptance is required. If any player
                 rejects the match or fails to accept before the timeout,  the
                 ticket continues to look for an acceptable match.

              AcceptanceRequired -> (boolean)
                 A  flag  that indicates whether a match that was created with
                 this configuration must be accepted by the  matched  players.
                 To  require  acceptance, set to TRUE. When this option is en-
                 abled, matchmaking tickets use the status REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE
                 to  indicate  when a completed potential match is waiting for
                 player acceptance.

              RuleSetName -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the matchmaking rule set to use  with
                 this  configuration. A matchmaking configuration can only use
                 rule sets that are defined in the same Region.

              RuleSetArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) associated with the  GameLift
                 matchmaking rule set resource that this configuration uses.

              NotificationTarget -> (string)
                 An  SNS topic ARN that is set up to receive matchmaking noti-
                 fications.

              AdditionalPlayerCount -> (integer)
                 The number of player slots in a match to keep open for future
                 players.  For example, if the configuration's rule set speci-
                 fies a match for a single 12-person team, and the  additional
                 player  count  is  set to 2, only 10 players are selected for
                 the match. This parameter is not used when  FlexMatchMode  is
                 set to STANDALONE .

              CustomEventData -> (string)
                 Information  to attach to all events related to the matchmak-
                 ing configuration.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp indicating when this data  object  was  created.
                 Format  is  a  number  expressed in Unix time as milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              GameProperties -> (list)
                 A set of key-value pairs that can store custom data in a game
                 session.   For   example:   {"Key":   "difficulty",  "Value":
                 "novice"} . This information is added to the new  GameSession
                 object that is created for a successful match. This parameter
                 is not used when FlexMatchMode is set to STANDALONE .

                 (structure)
                     This key-value pair can store custom data  about  a  game
                     session.  For  example,  you  might use a GameProperty to
                     track a game session's map, level of difficulty,  or  re-
                     maining  time.  The  difficulty  level could be specified
                     like this: {"Key": "difficulty", "Value":"Novice"} .

                     You can set game properties when creating a game session.
                     You  can  also  modify  game properties of an active game
                     session. When searching for game sessions, you can filter
                     on  game  property keys and values. You can't delete game
                     properties from a game session.

                     For examples of working with game properties, see  Create
                     a game session with properties .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The game property identifier.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The game property value.

              GameSessionData -> (string)
                 A  set of custom game session properties, formatted as a sin-
                 gle string value. This  data  is  passed  to  a  game  server
                 process  with a request to start a new game session. For more
                 information, see Start a game session . This  information  is
                 added  to  the  new  GameSession object that is created for a
                 successful match. This parameter is not used when  FlexMatch-
                 Mode is set to STANDALONE .

              BackfillMode -> (string)
                 The  method  used to backfill game sessions created with this
                 matchmaking configuration. MANUAL  indicates  that  the  game
                 makes  backfill  requests  or does not use the match backfill
                 feature. AUTOMATIC indicates that GameLift  creates  backfill
                 requests  whenever a game session has one or more open slots.
                 Learn more about manual and automatic  backfill  in  Backfill
                 existing  games  with  FlexMatch  . Automatic backfill is not
                 available when FlexMatchMode is set to STANDALONE .

              FlexMatchMode -> (string)
                 Indicates whether this  matchmaking  configuration  is  being
                 used  with  Amazon GameLift hosting or as a standalone match-
                 making solution.

                 o STANDALONE - FlexMatch forms matches and returns match  in-
                   formation,  including  players  and  team assignments, in a
                   MatchmakingSucceeded event.

                 o WITH_QUEUE - FlexMatch forms matches and uses the specified
                   Amazon  GameLift  queue  to  start  a  game session for the
                   match.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where to resume  retrieving  results  on  the
          next  call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results
          represent the end of the list.
