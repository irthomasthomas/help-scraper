DELETE-SCRIPT()                                                DELETE-SCRIPT()



NAME
       delete-script -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  Realtime  script.  This  operation  permanently deletes the
       script record. If script files were uploaded,  they  are  also  deleted
       (files stored in an S3 bucket are not deleted).

       To delete a script, specify the script ID. Before deleting a script, be
       sure to terminate all fleets that are deployed with  the  script  being
       deleted.  Fleet instances periodically check for script updates, and if
       the script record no longer exists, the instance will go into an  error
       state and be unable to host game sessions.

OPTIONS
       --script-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the Realtime script to delete. You can use
          either the script ID or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
