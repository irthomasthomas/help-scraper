CREATE-MATCHMAKING-RULE-SET()                    CREATE-MATCHMAKING-RULE-SET()



NAME
       create-matchmaking-rule-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new rule set for FlexMatch matchmaking. A rule set describes
       the type of match to create, such as the number and size of  teams.  It
       also sets the parameters for acceptable player matches, such as minimum
       skill level or character type.

       To create a matchmaking rule set, provide unique rule set name and  the
       rule set body in JSON format. Rule sets must be defined in the same Re-
       gion as the matchmaking configuration they are used with.

       Since matchmaking rule sets cannot be edited, it  is  a  good  idea  to
       check  the rule set syntax using ValidateMatchmakingRuleSet before cre-
       ating a new rule set.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A unique identifier for the matchmaking rule set. A matchmaking con-
          figuration  identifies the rule set it uses by this name value. Note
          that the rule set name is different from the optional name field  in
          the rule set body.

       --rule-set-body (string)
          A  collection of matchmaking rules, formatted as a JSON string. Com-
          ments are not allowed in JSON, but most elements support a  descrip-
          tion field.

       --tags (list)
          A list of labels to assign to the new matchmaking rule set resource.
          Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging Amazon Web  Ser-
          vices  resources  are useful for resource management, access manage-
          ment and cost allocation. For more information, see  Tagging  Amazon
          Web  Services Resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference
          .

          (structure)
              A label that you can assign to a Amazon GameLift resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for a developer-defined key value pair for tagging an
                 Amazon Web Services resource.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for a developer-defined key value pair for  tagging
                 an Amazon Web Services resource.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       RuleSet -> (structure)
          The newly created matchmaking rule set.

          RuleSetName -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the matchmaking rule set

          RuleSetArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is  assigned  to  a  Amazon
              GameLift  matchmaking  rule set resource and uniquely identifies
              it.  ARNs   are   unique   across   all   Regions.   Format   is
              arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::matchmakingruleset/<ruleset  name>  .
              In a GameLift rule set ARN, the resource ID matches the RuleSet-
