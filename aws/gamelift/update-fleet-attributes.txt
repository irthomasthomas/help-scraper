OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique identifier for the fleet to update attribute metadata for.
          You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --name (string)
          A descriptive label that is associated with a fleet. Fleet names  do
          not need to be unique.

       --description (string)
          A human-readable description of a fleet.

       --new-game-session-protection-policy (string)
          The game session protection policy to apply to all new game sessions
          created in this fleet. Game sessions that already exist are not  af-
          fected.  You  can  set protection for individual game sessions using
          UpdateGameSession .

          o NoProtection -- The  game  session  can  be  terminated  during  a
            scale-down event.

          o FullProtection  --  If the game session is in an ACTIVE status, it
            cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.

          Possible values:

          o NoProtection

          o FullProtection

       --resource-creation-limit-policy (structure)
          Policy settings that limit the number of game sessions an individual
          player can create over a span of time.

          NewGameSessionsPerCreator -> (integer)
              A  policy that puts limits on the number of game sessions that a
              player can create within a specified span  of  time.  With  this
              policy,  you  can  control players' ability to consume available
              resources.

              The policy is evaluated when a player tries to create a new game
              session.   On  receiving  a  CreateGameSession  request,  Amazon
              GameLift checks that the player (identified by CreatorId  )  has
              created  fewer than game session limit in the specified time pe-
              riod.

          PolicyPeriodInMinutes -> (integer)
              The time span used in evaluating  the  resource  creation  limit
              policy.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NewGameSessionsPerCreator=integer,PolicyPeriodInMinutes=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "NewGameSessionsPerCreator": integer,
            "PolicyPeriodInMinutes": integer
          }

       --metric-groups (list)
          The  name of a metric group to add this fleet to. Use a metric group
          in Amazon CloudWatch to aggregate the metrics from multiple  fleets.
          Provide  an existing metric group name, or create a new metric group
          by providing a new name. A fleet can only be in one metric group  at
          a time.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --anywhere-configuration (structure)
          Amazon GameLift Anywhere configuration options.

          Cost -> (string)
              The  cost  to  run your fleet per hour. Amazon GameLift uses the
              provided cost of your fleet to balance usage in queues. For more
              information  about  queues,  see Setting up queues in the Amazon
              GameLift Developer Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Cost=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Cost": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that was updated.

       FleetArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN  )  that  is  assigned to a Amazon
          GameLift fleet resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are  unique

          gion>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .
