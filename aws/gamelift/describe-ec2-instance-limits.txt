NAME
       describe-ec2-instance-limits -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the instance limits and current utilization for an Amazon Web
       Services Region or location. Instance limits control the number of  in-
       stances, per instance type, per location, that your Amazon Web Services
       account can use. Learn more at Amazon EC2 Instance Types . The informa-
       tion returned includes the maximum number of instances allowed and your
       account's current usage across all fleets. This information can  affect
       your  ability  to  scale your Amazon GameLift fleets. You can request a
       limit increase for your account by using the Service limits page in the
       Amazon GameLift console.

       Instance limits differ based on whether the instances are deployed in a
       fleet's home Region or in a remote location. For remote locations, lim-
       its  also differ based on the combination of home Region and remote lo-
       cation. All requests must specify an Amazon Web Services Region (either
       explicitly  or as your default settings). To get the limit for a remote
       location, you must also specify the location. For example, the  follow-
       ing requests all return different results:

       o Request specifies the Region ap-northeast-1 with no location. The re-
         sult is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed
         in us-east-2 , by all of the fleets that reside in ap-northeast-1 .

       o Request  specifies  the Region us-east-1 with location ca-central-1 .
         The result is limits and usage data on all instance  types  that  are
         deployed  in  ca-central-1  ,  by  all  of  the fleets that reside in
         us-east-2 . These limits do not affect fleets in  any  other  Regions
         that deploy instances to ca-central-1 .

       o Request  specifies  the Region eu-west-1 with location ca-central-1 .
         The result is limits and usage data on all instance  types  that  are
         deployed  in  ca-central-1  ,  by  all  of  the fleets that reside in
         eu-west-1 .

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To get limit and usage data for all instance types that are  deployed
         in  an  Amazon  Web Services Region by fleets that reside in the same
         Region: Specify the Region only. Optionally,  specify  a  single  in-
         stance type to retrieve information for.

       o To  get limit and usage data for all instance types that are deployed
         to a remote location by fleets that reside in  different  Amazon  Web
         Services  Region: Provide both the Amazon Web Services Region and the
         remote location. Optionally, specify a single instance  type  to  re-
         trieve information for.

       If  successful, an EC2InstanceLimits object is returned with limits and
       usage data for each requested instance type.

OPTIONS
       --ec2-instance-type (string)
          Name of an Amazon EC2 instance type  that  is  supported  in  Amazon
          GameLift.  A  fleet instance type determines the computing resources
          of each instance in the fleet, including CPU, memory,  storage,  and
          networking  capacity.  Do  not specify a value for this parameter to
          retrieve limits for all instance types.

       --location (string)
          The name of a remote location to request instance limits for, in the
          form of an Amazon Web Services Region code such as us-west-2 .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve service limits for an EC2 instance type

       The following describe-ec2-instance-limits example displays the maximum
       allowed instances and current instances in use for  the  specified  EC2
       instance  type  in  the  current Region. The result indicates that only
       five of the allowed twenty instances are being used.

          aws gamelift describe-ec2-instance-limits \
              --ec2-instance-type m5.large

       Output:

          {
              "EC2InstanceLimits": [
                  {
                      "EC2InstanceType": ""m5.large",
                      "CurrentInstances": 5,
                      "InstanceLimit": 20
                  }
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Choose  Computing  Resources  in  the  Amazon
       GameLift Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       EC2InstanceLimits -> (list)
          The maximum number of instances for the specified instance type.

          (structure)
              The  Amazon  GameLift  service limits for an Amazon EC2 instance
              type and current utilization. Amazon GameLift allows Amazon  Web
              Services  accounts  a  maximum number of instances, per instance
              type, per Amazon Web Services Region or location, for  use  with
              Amazon  GameLift. You can request an limit increase for your ac-
              count by using the Service limits page in  the  Amazon  GameLift
              console.

              EC2InstanceType -> (string)
                 The  name  of an Amazon EC2 instance type. See Amazon Elastic
                 Compute Cloud Instance Types for detailed descriptions.

              CurrentInstances -> (integer)
                 The number of instances for the specified type  and  location
                 that  are currently being used by the Amazon Web Services ac-
                 count.

              InstanceLimit -> (integer)
                 The number of instances that is allowed for the specified in-
                 stance type and location.

              Location -> (string)
                 An Amazon Web Services Region code, such as us-west-2 .
