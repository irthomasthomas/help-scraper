STOP-FLEET-ACTIONS()                                      STOP-FLEET-ACTIONS()



NAME
       stop-fleet-actions -

DESCRIPTION
       Suspends certain types of activity in a fleet location. Currently, this
       operation is used to stop  auto-scaling  activity.  For  multi-location
       fleets, fleet actions are managed separately for each location.

       Stopping fleet actions has several potential purposes. It allows you to
       temporarily stop auto-scaling activity but retain your scaling policies
       for  use  in  the  future.  For  multi-location  fleets, you can set up
       fleet-wide auto-scaling, and then opt out of it for certain locations.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To stop actions on instances in the fleet's home  Region,  provide  a
         fleet ID and the type of actions to suspend.

       o To  stop actions on instances in one of the fleet's remote locations,
         provide a fleet ID, a location name, and the type of actions to  sus-
         pend.

       If  successful,  GameLift  no longer initiates scaling events except in
       response to manual changes using  UpdateFleetCapacity . You can view  a
       fleet's   stopped   actions   using   DescribeFleetAttributes  or   De-
       scribeFleetLocationAttributes . Suspended activity can be restarted us-
       ing  StartFleetActions .

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to stop actions on.  You  can  use
          either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --actions (list)
          List of actions to suspend on the fleet.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            AUTO_SCALING

       --location (string)
          The  fleet location to stop fleet actions for. Specify a location in
          the form of an Amazon Web Services Region code, such as us-west-2 .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To stop a fleet's automatic scaling activity

       The following stop-fleet-actions example stops the use of  all  scaling
       policies  that  are defined for the specified fleet. After the policies
       are suspended, fleet capacity remains at the same active instance count
       unless you adjust it manually.

          aws gamelift start-fleet-actions \
              --fleet-id fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 \
              --actions AUTO_SCALING

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to stop actions on.

       FleetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift fleet
          resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all  Re-
          gions.           Format           is           arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
          gion>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .
