UPDATE-FLEET-PORT-SETTINGS()                      UPDATE-FLEET-PORT-SETTINGS()



NAME
       update-fleet-port-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  permissions that allow inbound traffic to connect to game ses-
       sions that are being hosted on instances in the fleet.

       To update settings, specify the fleet ID to be updated and specify  the
       changes to be made. List the permissions you want to add in InboundPer-
       missionAuthorizations , and permissions you want to remove in  Inbound-
       PermissionRevocations  .  Permissions to be removed must match existing
       fleet permissions.

       If successful, the fleet ID for the  updated  fleet  is  returned.  For
       fleets  with  remote  locations,  port setting updates can take time to
       propagate across all locations. You can check the status of updates  in
       each  location  by  calling  DescribeFleetPortSettings  with a location
       name.

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to update port settings  for.  You
          can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --inbound-permission-authorizations (list)
          A collection of port settings to be added to the fleet resource.

          (structure)
              A  range  of  IP  addresses and port settings that allow inbound
              traffic to connect to server  processes  on  an  instance  in  a
              fleet.  New game sessions are assigned an IP address/port number
              combination, which must fall into the  fleet's  allowed  ranges.
              Fleets  with custom game builds must have permissions explicitly
              set. For Realtime Servers fleets, GameLift  automatically  opens
              two port ranges, one for TCP messaging and one for UDP.

              FromPort -> (integer)
                 A starting value for a range of allowed port numbers.

                 For  fleets  using  Windows  and  Linux  builds,  only  ports
                 1026-60000 are valid.

              ToPort -> (integer)
                 An ending value for a range of  allowed  port  numbers.  Port
                 numbers  are  end-inclusive.  This  value must be higher than
                 FromPort .

                 For  fleets  using  Windows  and  Linux  builds,  only  ports
                 1026-60000 are valid.

              IpRange -> (string)
                 A range of allowed IP addresses. This value must be expressed
                 in CIDR notation. Example: "000.000.000.000/[subnet  mask]  "
                 or optionally the shortened version "0.0.0.0/[subnet mask] ".

              Protocol -> (string)
                 The network communication protocol used by the fleet.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FromPort=integer,ToPort=integer,IpRange=string,Protocol=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [

          ]

       --inbound-permission-revocations (list)
          A collection of port settings to be removed from the fleet resource.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that was updated.

       FleetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift fleet
          resource  and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Re-
          gions.           Format           is           arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
