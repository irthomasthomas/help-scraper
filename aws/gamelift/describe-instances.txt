DESCRIBE-INSTANCES()                                      DESCRIBE-INSTANCES()



NAME
       describe-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about  the  EC2 instances in an Amazon GameLift
       managed fleet, including instance ID, connection data, and status.  You
       can use this operation with a multi-location fleet to get location-spe-
       cific instance information.  As  an  alternative,  use  the  operations
       ListCompute  and   DescribeCompute  to retrieve information for compute
       resources, including EC2 and Anywhere fleets.

       You can call this operation in the following ways:

       o To get information on all instances in a fleet's home Region, specify
         the fleet ID.

       o To  get  information  on  all instances in a fleet's remote location,
         specify the fleet ID and location name.

       o To get information on a specific instance in  a  fleet,  specify  the
         fleet ID and instance ID.

       Use  the  pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequen-
       tial pages.

       If successful, this operation returns Instance  objects  for  each  re-
       quested instance, listed in no particular order. If you call this oper-
       ation for an Anywhere fleet, you receive an InvalidRequestException.

       describe-instances is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Instances

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the fleet to retrieve instance information
          for. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --instance-id (string)
          A unique identifier for an instance to retrieve. Specify an instance
          ID or leave blank to retrieve all instances in the fleet.

       --location (string)
          The  name of a location to retrieve instance information for, in the
          form of an Amazon Web Services Region code such as us-west-2 .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Instances -> (list)
          A  collection of objects containing properties for each instance re-
          turned.

          (structure)
              Represents a virtual computing instance that  runs  game  server
              processes  and  hosts  game sessions. In Amazon GameLift, one or
              more instances make up a managed EC2 fleet.

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the fleet that the  instance  belongs
                 to.

              FleetArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a Amazon
                 GameLift fleet resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs  are
                 unique  across  all  Regions. Format is arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
                 gion>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the instance.

              IpAddress -> (string)
                 IP address that is assigned to the instance.

              DnsName -> (string)
                 The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that  is  running
                 the game session. Values have the following format:

                 o TLS-enabled  fleets:  <unique  identifier>.<region  identi-
                   fier>.amazongamelift.com .

                 o Non-TLS-enabled   fleets:   ec2-<unique    identifier>.com-
                   pute.amazonaws.com . (See Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing
                   .)

                 When connecting to a  game  session  that  is  running  on  a
                 TLS-enabled  fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP ad-
                 dress.

              OperatingSystem -> (string)
                 Operating system that is running on this EC2 instance.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon Linux  2  (AL2)  will  reach  end  of  support  on
                     6/30/2025.  See more details in the Amazon Linux 2 FAQs .
                     For game servers that are hosted on AL2  and  use  Amazon
                     GameLift  server  SDK  4.x., first update the game server
                     build to server SDK 5.x, and then deploy  to  AL2023  in-
                     stances.  See  Migrate to Amazon GameLift server SDK ver-
                     sion 5.

              Type -> (string)
                 EC2 instance type that defines  the  computing  resources  of
                 this instance.

              Status -> (string)
                 Current status of the instance. Possible statuses include the
                 following:

                 o PENDING -- The instance is in the process of being  created
                   and  launching  server  processes as defined in the fleet's
                   run-time configuration.

                 o ACTIVE -- The instance has been successfully created and at
                   least  one server process has successfully launched and re-
                   ported back to Amazon GameLift that it is ready to  host  a
                   game  session. The instance is now considered ready to host
                   game sessions.

                 o TERMINATING -- The instance is in the process  of  shutting
                   down.  This  may happen to reduce capacity during a scaling
                   down event or to recycle resources in the event of a  prob-
                   lem.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  time  stamp  indicating when this data object was created.
                 Format is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              Location -> (string)
                 The  fleet  location  of the instance, expressed as an Amazon
                 Web Services Region code, such as us-west-2 .

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where to resume  retrieving  results  on  the
          next  call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results
          represent the end of the list.
