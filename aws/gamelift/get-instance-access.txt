GET-INSTANCE-ACCESS()                                    GET-INSTANCE-ACCESS()



NAME
       get-instance-access -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests  authorization to remotely connect to an instance in an Amazon
       GameLift managed fleet. Use this operation to connect to instances with
       game  servers  that  use  Amazon GameLift server SDK 4.x or earlier. To
       connect to instances with game servers  that  use  server  SDK  5.x  or
       later, call  GetComputeAccess .

       To  request access to an instance, specify IDs for the instance and the
       fleet it belongs to. You can retrieve instance IDs for a fleet by call-
       ing DescribeInstances with the fleet ID.

       If  successful,  this  operation returns an IP address and credentials.
       The returned credentials match the operating system of the instance, as
       follows:

       o For a Windows instance: returns a user name and secret (password) for
         use with a Windows Remote Desktop client.

       o For a Linux instance: returns a user name  and  secret  (RSA  private
         key)  for  use with an SSH client. You must save the secret to a .pem
         file. If you're using the CLI, see the example Get credentials for  a
         Linux  instance for tips on automatically saving the secret to a .pem
         file.

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that  contains  the  instance  you
          want  to  access.  You can request access to instances in EC2 fleets
          with the following statuses: ACTIVATING , ACTIVE , or  ERROR  .  Use
          either a fleet ID or an ARN value.

          NOTE:
              You can access fleets in ERROR status for a short period of time
              before Amazon GameLift deletes them.

       --instance-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the instance you want to access. You can ac-
          cess an instance in any status.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

          dress and access credentials.
