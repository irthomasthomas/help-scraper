DESCRIBE-COMPUTE()                                          DESCRIBE-COMPUTE()



NAME
       describe-compute -

DESCRIPTION
          This  operation  has  been  expanded to use with the Amazon GameLift
          containers feature, which is currently in public preview.

       Retrieves properties for a  compute  resource  in  an  Amazon  GameLift
       fleet. To get a list of all computes in a fleet, call  ListCompute .

       To  request information on a specific compute, provide the fleet ID and
       compute name.

       If successful, this operation returns details for the requested compute
       resource.  Depending  on  the fleet's compute type, the result includes
       the following information:

       o For EC2 fleets, this operation returns information about the EC2  in-
         stance.

       o For  ANYWHERE  fleets,  this  operation returns information about the
         registered compute.

       o For CONTAINER fleets, this operation returns  information  about  the
         container  that's registered as a compute, and the instance it's run-
         ning on. The compute name is the container name.

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that the compute belongs  to.  You
          can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --compute-name (string)
          The unique identifier of the compute resource to retrieve properties
          for. For an Anywhere fleet compute, use the registered compute name.
          For  an  EC2  fleet  instance,  use the instance ID. For a container
          fleet,     use     the     compute      name      (for      example,
          a123b456c789012d3e4567f8a901b23c/1a234b56-7cd8-9e0f-a1b2-c34d567ef8a9
          ) or the compute ARN.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Compute -> (structure)
          The set of properties for the requested compute resource.

          FleetId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the fleet that the compute belongs to.

          FleetArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the fleet that the compute be-
              longs to.

          ComputeName -> (string)
              A descriptive label for the compute resource. For instances in a
              managed EC2 fleet, the compute name is the same value as the In-
              stanceId ID.

          ComputeArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  that  is  assigned  to a compute resource and uniquely
              identifies it. ARNs are unique across  locations.  Instances  in
              managed EC2 fleets are not assigned a Compute ARN.

          IpAddress -> (string)
              The IP address of a compute resource. Amazon GameLift requires a
              DNS name or IP address for a compute.

          DnsName -> (string)
              The DNS name of a compute resource. Amazon GameLift  requires  a
              DNS name or IP address for a compute.

          ComputeStatus -> (string)
              Current  status  of  the  compute. A compute must have an ACTIVE
              status to host game sessions.

          Location -> (string)
              The name of the custom location you added to the fleet that this
              compute resource resides in.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A  time stamp indicating when this data object was created. For-
              mat is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for  ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          OperatingSystem -> (string)
              The type of operating system on the compute resource.

              NOTE:
                 Amazon  Linux 2 (AL2) will reach end of support on 6/30/2025.
                 See more details in the  Amazon  Linux  2  FAQs  .  For  game
                 servers that are hosted on AL2 and use Amazon GameLift server
                 SDK 4.x., first update the game server build  to  server  SDK
                 5.x, and then deploy to AL2023 instances. See Migrate to Ama-
                 zon GameLift server SDK version 5.

          Type -> (string)
              The Amazon EC2 instance type that the fleet uses. For registered
              computes  in an Amazon GameLift Anywhere fleet, this property is
              empty.

          GameLiftServiceSdkEndpoint -> (string)
              The Amazon GameLift SDK endpoint  connection  for  a  registered
              compute  resource  in an Anywhere fleet. The game servers on the
              compute use this endpoint to connect to the Amazon GameLift ser-
              vice.

          GameLiftAgentEndpoint -> (string)
              The endpoint of the Amazon GameLift Agent.

          InstanceId -> (string)
              The InstanceID of the Instance hosting the compute for Container
              and Managed EC2 fleets.

          ContainerAttributes -> (structure)
              Some attributes of a container.

              ContainerPortMappings -> (list)
                 Describes how container ports map to connection ports on  the
                 fleet  instance.  Incoming  traffic  connects to a game via a
                 connection port. A ContainerPortMapping directs  the  traffic
                 from  a connection port to a port on the container that hosts
                 the game session.

                 (structure)
                        This data type is used with the Amazon  GameLift  con-
                        tainers feature, which is currently in public preview.

                     Defines  how  an internal-facing container port is mapped
                     to an external-facing connection port on a fleet instance
                     of  compute  type CONTAINER . Incoming traffic, such as a
                     game client, uses a  connection  port  to  connect  to  a
                     process  in  the container fleet. Amazon GameLift directs
                     the inbound traffic to the container  port  that  is  as-
                     signed to the process, such as a game session, running on
                     a container.
                        Part of:   ContainerAttributes

                     ContainerPort -> (integer)
                        The port opened on the container.

                     ConnectionPort -> (integer)
                        The port opened on the fleet instance.  This  is  also
                        called the "host port".

                     Protocol -> (string)
                        The network protocol that this mapping supports.
