       Retrieves  properties  for a compute resource. To request a compute re-
       source specify the fleet ID and compute name. If  successful,  GameLift
       returns an object containing the build properties.

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet the compute is registered to.

       --compute-name (string)
          A  descriptive  label  that  is associated with the compute resource
          registered to your fleet.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Compute -> (structure)
          The  details of the compute resource you registered to the specified
          fleet.

          FleetId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the fleet that the compute is registered
              to.

          FleetArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the fleet that the compute is
              registered to.

          ComputeName -> (string)
              A descriptive label that is associated with the compute resource
              registered to your fleet.

          ComputeArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  that  is assigned to the compute resource and uniquely
              identifies it. ARNs are unique across locations.

          IpAddress -> (string)
              The IP address of the compute resource.  GameLift  requires  the
              DNS name or IP address to manage your compute resource.

          DnsName -> (string)
              The  DNS name of the compute resource. GameLift requires the DNS
              name or IP address to manage your compute resource.

          ComputeStatus -> (string)
              Current status of the compute. A compute  must  have  an  ACTIVE
              status to host game sessions.

          Location -> (string)
              The name of the custom location you added to the fleet that this
              compute resource resides in.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A time stamp indicating when this data object was created.  For-
              mat  is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          OperatingSystem -> (string)
              The type of operating system on your compute resource.

          Type -> (string)
              Which compute type that the fleet uses. A fleet can use Anywhere
              compute resources owned by you or managed Amazon EC2 instances.

          GameLiftServiceSdkEndpoint -> (string)
              The  endpoint  connection  details  of the GameLift SDK endpoint
              that your game server connects to.
