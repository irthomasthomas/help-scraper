CLAIM-GAME-SERVER()                                        CLAIM-GAME-SERVER()



NAME
       claim-game-server -

DESCRIPTION
          This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and
          game server groups.

       Locates an available game server and temporarily reserves  it  to  host
       gameplay  and  players.  This operation is called from a game client or
       client service (such as a matchmaker) to request hosting resources  for
       a  new  game  session.  In response, Amazon GameLift FleetIQ locates an
       available game server, places it in CLAIMED status for 60 seconds,  and
       returns  connection  information that players can use to connect to the
       game server.

       To claim a game server, identify a game  server  group.  You  can  also
       specify  a  game  server  ID,  although  this  approach bypasses Amazon
       GameLift FleetIQ placement optimization. Optionally, include game  data
       to  pass  to  the game server at the start of a game session, such as a
       game map or player information. Add filter options to further  restrict
       how  a game server is chosen, such as only allowing game servers on AC-
       TIVE instances to be claimed.

       When a game server is successfully claimed, connection  information  is
       returned.  A claimed game server's utilization status remains AVAILABLE
       while the claim status is set to CLAIMED for up  to  60  seconds.  This
       time period gives the game server time to update its status to UTILIZED
       after players join. If the game server's status is not  updated  within
       60  seconds,  the game server reverts to unclaimed status and is avail-
       able to be claimed by another request. The claim time period is a fixed
       value and is not configurable.

       If  you  try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in
       the following cases:

       o If the game server utilization status is UTILIZED .

       o If the game server claim status is CLAIMED .

       o If the game server is running on an instance in DRAINING  status  and
         the  provided  filter  option  does not allow placing on DRAINING in-
         stances.

OPTIONS
       --game-server-group-name (string)
          A unique identifier for the game server group where the game  server
          is  running.  If you are not specifying a game server to claim, this
          value identifies where you want Amazon GameLift FleetIQ to look  for
          an available game server to claim.

       --game-server-id (string)
          A  custom  string that uniquely identifies the game server to claim.
          If this parameter is left empty, Amazon  GameLift  FleetIQ  searches
          for an available game server in the specified game server group.

       --game-server-data (string)
          A set of custom game server properties, formatted as a single string
          value. This data is passed to a game client or service when  it  re-
          quests information on game servers.

       --filter-option (structure)
          Object that restricts how a claimed game server is chosen.

          InstanceStatuses -> (list)
              List  of  instance statuses that game servers may be claimed on.
              If provided, the list must contain the ACTIVE status.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InstanceStatuses=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "InstanceStatuses": ["ACTIVE"|"DRAINING", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GameServer -> (structure)
          Object that describes the newly claimed game server.

          GameServerGroupName -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the game server  group  where  the  game
              server is running.

          GameServerGroupArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  identifier  for  the  game server group where the game
              server is located.

          GameServerId -> (string)
              A custom string that uniquely identifies the game  server.  Game
              server  IDs are developer-defined and are unique across all game
              server groups in an Amazon Web Services account.

          InstanceId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the instance where the game server  is
              running.  This ID is available in the instance metadata. EC2 in-
              stance   IDs   use   a   17-character   format,   for   example:
              i-1234567890abcdef0 .

          ConnectionInfo -> (string)
              The  port and IP address that must be used to establish a client
              connection to the game server.

          GameServerData -> (string)
              A set of custom game server properties, formatted  as  a  single
              string  value.  This  data is passed to a game client or service
              when it requests information on game servers.

          ClaimStatus -> (string)
              Indicates when an available game server has  been  reserved  for
              gameplay  but  has  not  yet  started hosting a game. Once it is
              claimed, the game server remains in CLAIMED status for a maximum
              of  one  minute.  During  this time, game clients connect to the
              game server to start the game and trigger the game server to up-
              date  its  utilization status. After one minute, the game server
              claim status reverts to null.

          UtilizationStatus -> (string)
              Indicates whether the game server is currently available for new
              games or is busy. Possible statuses include:

              o AVAILABLE - The game server is available to be claimed. A game
                server that has been claimed remains in this status  until  it
                reports game hosting activity.

              o UTILIZED - The game server is currently hosting a game session
                with players.

          RegistrationTime -> (timestamp)
              Timestamp that indicates when the game  server  registered.  The
              format  is  a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for
              example "1469498468.057" ).

          LastClaimTime -> (timestamp)
              Timestamp that indicates the  last  time  the  game  server  was
              claimed.  The  format is a number expressed in Unix time as mil-
              liseconds (for example "1469498468.057" ). This value is used to
              calculate  when  a claimed game server's status should revert to
              null.

          LastHealthCheckTime -> (timestamp)
              Timestamp that indicates the last time the game server  was  up-
              dated  with  health  status. The format is a number expressed in
              Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057" ). After
              game  server  registration, this property is only changed when a
              game server update specifies a health check value.
