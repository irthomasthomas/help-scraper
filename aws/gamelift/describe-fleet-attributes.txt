DESCRIBE-FLEET-ATTRIBUTES()                        DESCRIBE-FLEET-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       describe-fleet-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
          This  operation  has  been  expanded to use with the Amazon GameLift
          containers feature, which is currently in public preview.

       Retrieves core fleet-wide properties for fleets in an Amazon  Web  Ser-
       vices  Region. Properties include the computing hardware and deployment
       configuration for instances in the fleet.

       You can use this operation in the following ways:

       o To get attributes for specific fleets, provide a list of fleet IDs or
         fleet ARNs.

       o To get attributes for all fleets, do not provide a fleet identifier.

       When  requesting attributes for multiple fleets, use the pagination pa-
       rameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

       If successful, a FleetAttributes object is returned for each fleet  re-
       quested, unless the fleet identifier is not found.

       NOTE:
              Some  API  operations limit the number of fleet IDs that allowed
              in one request. If a request exceeds  this  limit,  the  request
              fails and the error message contains the maximum allowed number.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-fleet-attributes  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: FleetAttributes

OPTIONS
       --fleet-ids (list)
          A list of unique fleet identifiers to retrieve attributes  for.  You
          can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. To retrieve attributes for
          all current fleets, do not include this parameter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example1: To view attributes for a list of fleets

       The following describe-fleet-attributes  example  retrieves  fleet  at-
       tributes  for  two specified fleets. As shown, the requested fleets are
       deployed with the same build, one for On-Demand instances and  one  for
       Spot instances, with some minor configuration differences.

       Example2: To request attributes for all fleets

       The  following  describe-fleet-attributes  returns fleet attributes for
       all fleets with any status. This example illustrates the use of pagina-
       tion parameters to return one fleet at a time.

          aws gamelift describe-fleet-attributes \
              --limit 1

       Output:

          {
              "FleetAttributes": [
                  {
                      "FleetId": "fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",

       The  output  includes  a NextToken value that you can use when you call
       the command a second time. Pass the value to the --next-token parameter
       to  specify  where to pick up the output. The following command returns
       the second result in the output.

          aws gamelift describe-fleet-attributes \
              --limit 1 \
              --next-token eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC01NWYxZTZmMS1jY2FlLTQ3YTctOWI5ZS1iYjFkYTQwMjEXAMPLE1

       Repeat until the response doesn't include a NextToken value.

       GameLift Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       FleetAttributes -> (list)
          A  collection  of objects containing attribute metadata for each re-
          quested fleet ID. Attribute objects are  returned  only  for  fleets
          that currently exist.

          (structure)
                 This  operation  has  been  expanded  to  use with the Amazon
                 GameLift containers feature, which  is  currently  in  public
                 preview.

              Describes  an  Amazon  GameLift fleet of game hosting resources.
              Attributes differ based on the fleet's compute type, as follows:

              o EC2 fleet attributes identify a  Build  resource  (for  fleets
                with  customer  game  server builds) or a Script resource (for
                Realtime Servers fleets).

              o Container fleets have ContainerGroupsAttributes , which  iden-
                tify the fleet's ContainerGroupDefinition resources.

              o Amazon GameLift Anywhere fleets have an abbreviated set of at-
                tributes, because most fleet configurations are  set  directly
                on  the fleet's computes. Attributes include fleet identifiers
                and descriptive  properties,  creation/termination  time,  and
                fleet status.
                 Returned by:   DescribeFleetAttributes

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the fleet.

              FleetArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a Amazon
                 GameLift fleet resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs  are
                 unique  across  all  Regions. Format is arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
                 gion>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .  In
                 a  GameLift  fleet  ARN,  the resource ID matches the FleetId
                 value.

              FleetType -> (string)
                 Indicates whether the fleet uses On-Demand or Spot instances.
                 For  more  information, see On-Demand versus Spot Instances .
                 This fleet property can't be changed after the fleet is  cre-
                 ated.

              InstanceType -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  EC2  instance type that the fleet uses. Instance
                 type determines the computing resources of each  instance  in
                 the fleet, including CPU, memory, storage, and networking ca-
                 pacity. See Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Instance  Types  for
                 detailed  descriptions.  This  attribute  is used with fleets
                 where ComputeType is "EC2" or "Container".

              Description -> (string)
                 A human-readable description of the fleet.

              Name -> (string)
                 A descriptive label that is associated with  a  fleet.  Fleet
                 names do not need to be unique.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  time  stamp  indicating when this data object was created.
                 Format is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              TerminationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp indicating when this data object was terminated.
                 Format is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              Status -> (string)
                 Current  status of the fleet. Possible fleet statuses include
                 the following:

                 o NEW -- A new fleet resource has  been  defined  and  Amazon
                   GameLift  has started creating the fleet. Desired instances
                   is set to 1.

                 o DOWNLOADING/VALIDATING/BUILDING -- Amazon GameLift is down-
                   load  the  game  server build, running install scripts, and
                   then validating the  build  files.  When  complete,  Amazon
                   GameLift launches a fleet instance.

                 o ACTIVATING  --  Amazon  GameLift is launching a game server
                   process  and  testing  its  connectivity  with  the  Amazon
                   GameLift service.

                 o ACTIVE -- The fleet is now ready to host game sessions.

                 o ERROR  --  An  error occurred when downloading, validating,
                   building, or activating the fleet.

                 o DELETING -- Hosts are responding to a delete fleet request.

                 o TERMINATED -- The fleet no longer exists.

              BuildId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the build resource that  is  deployed
                 on  instances  in  this  fleet.  This  attribute is used with

                 used with fleets where ComputeType is "EC2" or "Container".

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon  Linux  2  (AL2)  will  reach  end  of  support on
                     6/30/2025. See more details in the Amazon Linux 2 FAQs  .
                     For  game  servers  that are hosted on AL2 and use Amazon
                     GameLift server SDK 4.x., first update  the  game  server
                     build  to  server  SDK 5.x, and then deploy to AL2023 in-
                     stances. See Migrate to Amazon GameLift server  SDK  ver-
                     sion 5.

              ResourceCreationLimitPolicy -> (structure)
                 A policy that puts limits on the number of game sessions that
                 a player can create within a specified  span  of  time.  With
                 this  policy,  you  can  control  players' ability to consume
                 available resources.

                 The policy is evaluated when a player tries to create  a  new
                 game  session. On receiving a CreateGameSession request, Ama-
                 zon GameLift checks that the player (identified by  CreatorId
                 )  has created fewer than game session limit in the specified
                 time period.

                 NewGameSessionsPerCreator -> (integer)
                     A policy that puts limits on the number of game  sessions
                     that a player can create within a specified span of time.
                     With this policy, you can  control  players'  ability  to
                     consume available resources.

                     The  policy  is evaluated when a player tries to create a
                     new game session. On receiving  a  CreateGameSession  re-
                     quest, Amazon GameLift checks that the player (identified
                     by CreatorId ) has created fewer than game session  limit
                     in the specified time period.

                 PolicyPeriodInMinutes -> (integer)
                     The  time  span  used in evaluating the resource creation
                     limit policy.

              MetricGroups -> (list)
                 Name of a metric group that metrics for this fleet are  added
                 to. In Amazon CloudWatch, you can view aggregated metrics for
                 fleets that are in a metric group. A fleet can be included in
                 only  one metric group at a time. This attribute is used with
                 fleets where ComputeType is "EC2" or "Container".

                 (string)

              StoppedActions -> (list)
                 A list of  fleet  activity  that  has  been  suspended  using
                 StopFleetActions . This includes fleet auto-scaling. This at-
                 tribute is used with fleets where  ComputeType  is  "EC2"  or
                 "Container".

                 (string)

              InstanceRoleArn -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier for an IAM role with access permissions
                 to other Amazon Web Services services. Any  application  that
                 runs  on an instance in the fleet--including install scripts,
                 server processes, and other processes--can use these  permis-
                 sions to interact with Amazon Web Services resources that you
                 own or have access to. For more information about  using  the
                 role with your game server builds, see Communicate with other
                 Amazon Web Services resources from your fleets . This  attri-
                 bute  is used with fleets where ComputeType is "EC2" or "Con-
                 tainer".

              CertificateConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Determines whether a TLS/SSL certificate is generated  for  a
                 fleet.  This feature must be enabled when creating the fleet.
                 All instances in a fleet share the same certificate.

                 CertificateType -> (string)
                     Indicates whether a TLS/SSL certificate is generated  for
                     a fleet.

                     Valid values include:

                     o GENERATED  -  Generate  a  TLS/SSL certificate for this
                       fleet.

                     o DISABLED - (default) Do not generate a TLS/SSL certifi-
                       cate for this fleet.

              ComputeType -> (string)
                 The  type of compute resource used to host your game servers.
                 You can use your own compute resources with  Amazon  GameLift
                 Anywhere  or  use  Amazon  EC2  instances with managed Amazon
                 GameLift.

              AnywhereConfiguration -> (structure)
                     This property is used with the Amazon GameLift containers
                     feature,  which  is currently in public preview. A set of
                     attributes that describe the container  groups  that  are
                     deployed  on the fleet. These attributes are included for
                     fleets with compute type CONTAINER only.  This  attribute
                     is used with fleets where ComputeType is "Container".

                 Cost -> (string)
                     The cost to run your fleet per hour. Amazon GameLift uses
                     the provided cost of  your  fleet  to  balance  usage  in
                     queues. For more information about queues, see Setting up
                     queues in the Amazon GameLift Developer Guide .

              InstanceRoleCredentialsProvider -> (string)
                 Indicates that fleet instances maintain a shared  credentials
                 file  for  the  IAM  role defined in InstanceRoleArn . Shared
                 credentials allow applications that  are  deployed  with  the
                 game  server  executable to communicate with other Amazon Web
                 Services resources. This property is used only when the  game
                 server  is  integrated  with  the server SDK version 5.x. For
                 more  information  about  using   shared   credentials,   see
                 Communicate  with  other  Amazon  Web Services resources from
                 your fleets . This attribute is used with fleets  where  Com-
                 puteType is "EC2" or "Container".

              ContainerGroupsAttributes -> (structure)
                 A  set  of properties that describe the container groups that
                 are deployed to the fleet. These attributes are included  for
                 fleets with compute type CONTAINER .

                 ContainerGroupDefinitionProperties -> (list)
                     A  collection  of properties that describe each container
                     group in the fleet. A container fleet  is  deployed  with
                     one or more  ContainerGroupDefinition resources, which is
                     where these properties are set.

                     (structure)
                            This data type is used with  the  Amazon  GameLift
                            containers  feature,  which is currently in public
                            preview.

                        The properties of a container group that  is  deployed
                        to a container fleet.

                     A  set  of ports that allow inbound traffic to connect to
                     processes running in the fleet's container groups. Amazon
                     GameLift  maps  each connection port to a container port,
                     which is assigned to  a  specific  container  process.  A
                     fleet's  connection  port range can't be changed, but you
                     can control access to  connection  ports  by  updating  a
                     fleet's  EC2InboundPermissions  with  UpdateFleetPortSet-
                     tings .

                     FromPort -> (integer)

                     ToPort -> (integer)
                        Ending value for the port. Port numbers are end-inclu-
                        sive.  This  value  must  be  equal to or greater than
                        FromPort .

                 ContainerGroupsPerInstance -> (structure)
                     Details about the number of replica container groups that
                     Amazon GameLift deploys to each instance in the container
                     fleet.

                     DesiredReplicaContainerGroupsPerInstance -> (integer)
                        The desired number  of  replica  container  groups  to
                        place on each fleet instance.

                     MaxReplicaContainerGroupsPerInstance -> (integer)
                        The  maximum  possible  number  of  replica  container
                        groups that each fleet instance can have.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where to resume  retrieving  results  on  the
          next  call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results
          represent the end of the list.
