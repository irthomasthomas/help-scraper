NAME
       update-container-group-definition -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  properties in an existing container group definition. This op-
       eration doesn't replace the definition. Instead, it creates a new  ver-
       sion of the definition and saves it separately. You can access all ver-
       sions that you choose to retain.

       The only property you can't update is the container group type.
          Request options:

       o Update based on the latest version of the container group definition.
         Specify the container group definition name only, or use an ARN value
         without a version number. Provide updated values for  the  properties
         that you want to change only. All other values remain the same as the
         latest version.

       o Update based on a specific version of the container group definition.
         Specify the container group definition name and a source version num-
         ber, or use an ARN value with a version number. Provide updated  val-
         ues for the properties that you want to change only. All other values
         remain the same as the source version.

       o Change a game server container definition. Provide the  updated  con-
         tainer definition.

       o Add  or change a support container definition. Provide a complete set
         of container definitions, including the updated definition.

       o Remove a support container definition. Provide a complete set of con-
         tainer  definitions,  excluding the definition to remove. If the con-
         tainer group has only one support container  definition,  provide  an
         empty set.
          Results:

       If  successful,  this  operation returns the complete properties of the
       new container group definition version.

       If the container group definition version is used in an active  fleets,
       the  update  automatically  initiates a new fleet deployment of the new
       version. You can track a fleet's  deployments  using   ListFleetDeploy-
       ments .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A  descriptive  identifier  for  the container group definition. The
          name value must be unique in an Amazon Web Services Region.

       --game-server-container-definition (structure)
          An updated definition for the game server container in  this  group.
          Define a game server container only when the container group type is
          GAME_SERVER . You can pass in your container definitions as  a  JSON
          file.

          ContainerName -> (string)
              A  string  that  uniquely  identifies  the  container definition
              within a container group.

          DependsOn -> (list)
              Establishes dependencies between this container and  the  status
              of other containers in the same container group. A container can
              have dependencies on multiple different containers.

              You can use dependencies to  establish  a  startup/shutdown  se-
              quence  across the container group. For example, you might spec-
              ify that ContainerB has a START dependency on ContainerA .  This
              dependency  means  that  ContainerB can't start until after Con-
              tainerA has started. This dependency is  reversed  on  shutdown,
              which means that ContainerB must shut down before ContainerA can
              shut down.

              (structure)
                 A container's dependency on another  container  in  the  same
                 container  group.  The  dependency  impacts how the dependent
                 container is able to start or shut down based the  status  of
                 the other container.

                 For  example, ContainerA is configured with the following de-
                 pendency: a START dependency on ContainerB . This means  that
                 ContainerA  can't start until ContainerB has started. It also
                 means that ContainerA must shut down before ContainerB .

                 ContainerName -> (string)
                     A  descriptive  label  for  the container definition that
                     this container depends on.

                 Condition -> (string)
                     The condition that the dependency  container  must  reach
                     before  the  dependent  container can start. Valid condi-
                     tions include:

                     o START - The dependency container must have started.

                     o COMPLETE - The dependency container has run to  comple-
                       tion (exits). Use this condition with nonessential con-
                       tainers, such as those that run a script and then exit.
                       The  dependency  container  can't  be an essential con-
                       tainer.

                     o SUCCESS - The dependency container has run  to  comple-
                       tion and exited with a zero status. The dependency con-
                       tainer can't be an essential container.

                     o HEALTHY -  The  dependency  container  has  passed  its
                       Docker health check. Use this condition with dependency
                       containers that have  health  checks  configured.  This
                       condition is confirmed at container group startup only.

          MountPoints -> (list)
              A  mount  point that binds a path inside the container to a file
              or directory on the host system and lets it access the  file  or
              directory.

              (structure)
                 A  mount  point that binds a container to a file or directory
                 on the host system.

                     The path to the source file or directory.

                 ContainerPath -> (string)
                     The mount path on the container. If this  property  isn't
                     set, the instance path is used.

                 AccessLevel -> (string)
                     The type of access for the container.

          EnvironmentOverride -> (list)
              A  set  of  environment  variables  to  pass to the container on
              startup. See the ContainerDefinition::environment  parameter  in
              the Amazon Elastic Container Service API Reference .

              (structure)
                 An  environment  variable  to  set inside a container, in the
                 form of a key-value pair.

                     The environment variable name.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The environment variable value.

          ImageUri -> (string)
              The location of the container image to  deploy  to  a  container
              fleet.  Provide an image in an Amazon Elastic Container Registry
              public or private repository. The repository must be in the same
              Amazon Web Services account and Amazon Web Services Region where
              you're creating the container group definition.  For  limits  on
              image  size,  see Amazon GameLift endpoints and quotas . You can
              use any of the following image URI formats:

              o Image  ID  only:  [AWS  account].dkr.ecr.[AWS  region].amazon-
                aws.com/[repository ID]

                aws.com/[repository ID]:[tag]

          PortConfiguration -> (structure)
              A  set  of ports that Amazon GameLift can assign to processes in
              the container. Processes, must be assigned a container  port  to
              accept  inbound  traffic connections. For example, a game server
              process requires a container port to allow game clients to  con-
              nect  to it. Container ports aren't directly accessed by inbound
              traffic. Instead, Amazon GameLift maps container ports to exter-
              nally accessible connection ports (see the container fleet prop-
              erty ConnectionPortRange ).

              ContainerPortRanges -> (list)
                 A set of one or more container port number ranges. The ranges
                 can't overlap.

                 (structure)
                     A  set  of one or more port numbers that can be opened on
                     the container.

                     FromPort -> (integer)
                        A starting value for the range of  allowed  port  num-
                        bers.

                     ToPort -> (integer)
                        An ending value for the range of allowed port numbers.
                        Port numbers are end-inclusive.  This  value  must  be
                        equal to or greater than FromPort .

                     Protocol -> (string)
                        The network protocol that these ports support.

          ServerSdkVersion -> (string)
              The  Amazon  GameLift server SDK version that the game server is
              integrated with. Only game servers using  5.2.0  or  higher  are
              compatible with container fleets.

       --support-container-definitions (list)
          One  or  more  definitions for support containers in this group. You
          can define a support container in any type of container  group.  You
          can pass in your container definitions as a JSON file.

          (structure)
              Describes  a support container in a container group. You can de-
              fine a support container in either a game server container group
              or  a per-instance container group. Support containers don't run
              game server processes.

              This definition includes container configuration, resources, and
              start instructions. Use this data type when creating or updating
              a container group definition. For properties of a deployed  sup-
              port container, see  SupportContainerDefinition .

              ContainerName -> (string)
                 A string that uniquely identifies  the  container  definition
                 within a container group.

              DependsOn -> (list)
                 Establishes  dependencies between this container and the sta-
                 tus of other containers in the same container group.  A  con-
                 tainer  can  have dependencies on multiple different contain-
                 ers.

                 .

                 You can use dependencies to establish a startup/shutdown  se-
                 quence  across  the  container  group. For example, you might
                 specify that ContainerB has a START dependency on  ContainerA
                 . This dependency means that ContainerB can't start until af-
                 ter ContainerA has started. This dependency  is  reversed  on
                 shutdown,  which  means that ContainerB must shut down before
                 ContainerA can shut down.

                 (structure)
                     A container's dependency on another container in the same

                     container is able to start or shut down based the  status
                     of the other container.

                     For  example, ContainerA is configured with the following
                     dependency: a START dependency on ContainerB . This means
                     that ContainerA can't start until ContainerB has started.
                     It also means that ContainerA must shut down before  Con-
                     tainerB .

                        The condition that the dependency container must reach
                        before the dependent container can start. Valid condi-
                        tions include:

                 (structure)
                     An environment variable to set inside a container, in the
                     form of a key-value pair.
                        Part  of:    GameServerContainerDefinition  ,    Game-
                        ServerContainerDefinitionInput ,  SupportContainerDef-
                        inition ,  SupportContainerDefinitionInput

                     Name -> (string)
                        The environment variable name.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The environment variable value.

              Essential -> (boolean)
                 Flags the container as vital for the container group to func-
                 tion  properly.  If  an essential container fails, the entire
                 container group restarts. At least one support container in a
                 per-instance container group must be essential. When flagging
                 a container as essential, also configure a  health  check  so
                 that the container can signal that it's healthy.

              HealthCheck -> (structure)
                 Configuration  for  a  non-terminal health check. A container
                 automatically restarts if it stops functioning. With a health
                 check,  you can define additional reasons to flag a container
                 as unhealthy and restart it. If an essential container  fails
                 a health check, the entire container group restarts.

                 Command -> (list)
                     A  string  array that specifies the command that the con-
                     tainer runs to determine if it's healthy.

                     (string)

                 Interval -> (integer)
                     The time period (in seconds) between each health check.

                 Retries -> (integer)
                     The number of times to retry a failed health check before
                     flagging  the  container  unhealthy. The first run of the
                     command does not count as a retry.

                 StartPeriod -> (integer)
                     The optional grace period (in seconds)  to  give  a  con-
                     tainer  time  to bootstrap before the first failed health
                     check counts toward the number of retries.

                 Timeout -> (integer)
                     The time period (in seconds) to wait for a  health  check
                     to succeed before counting a failed health check.

              ImageUri -> (string)
                 The  location of the container image to deploy to a container
                 fleet. Provide an image in an Amazon Elastic  Container  Reg-
                 istry public or private repository. The repository must be in
                 the same Amazon Web Services account and Amazon Web  Services
                 Region  where you're creating the container group definition.
                 For limits on image size, see Amazon GameLift  endpoints  and
                 quotas . You can use any of the following image URI formats:

                 o Image  ID  only: [AWS account].dkr.ecr.[AWS region].amazon-
                   aws.com/[repository ID]

                   zonaws.com/[repository ID]:[tag]

              MemoryHardLimitMebibytes -> (integer)
                 A specified amount of memory (in MiB)  to  reserve  for  this
                 container.  If  you don't specify a container-specific memory
                 limit, the container shares the container group's total  mem-
                 ory allocation.

              PortConfiguration -> (structure)
                 A set of ports that Amazon GameLift can assign  to  processes
                 in  the  container. Any processes that accept inbound traffic
                 connections must be assigned a port from this set.  The  con-
                 tainer  port range must be large enough to assign one to each
                 process in the container that needs one.

                 Container ports aren't directly accessed by inbound  traffic.
                 Amazon  GameLift maps these container ports to externally ac-
                 cessible connection ports, which are assigned as needed  from
                 the container fleet's ConnectionPortRange .

                 ContainerPortRanges -> (list)
                     A  set  of  one or more container port number ranges. The
                     ranges can't overlap.

                     (structure)
                        A set of one or more port numbers that can  be  opened
                        on the container.
                            Part of:   ContainerPortConfiguration

                        FromPort -> (integer)
                            A  starting  value  for  the range of allowed port
                            numbers.

                        ToPort -> (integer)
                            An ending value for the range of allowed port num-
                            bers.  Port  numbers are end-inclusive. This value
                            must be equal to or greater than FromPort .

                        Protocol -> (string)
                            The network protocol that these ports support.

              Vcpu -> (double)
                 The number of vCPU units to reserve for this  container.  The
                 container  can  use more resources when needed, if available.
                 If you don't reserve CPU units for this container, it  shares
                 the container group's total vCPU limit.

       --total-memory-limit-mebibytes (integer)
          The maximum amount of memory (in MiB) to allocate to  the  container
          group. All containers in the group share this memory. If you specify
          memory limits for an individual container, the total value  must  be
          greater than any individual container's memory limit.

       --total-vcpu-limit (double)
          The  maximum amount of vCPU units to allocate to the container group
          (1 vCPU is equal to 1024 CPU units). All  containers  in  the  group
          share  this  memory.  If you specify vCPU limits for individual con-
          tainers, the total value must be equal to or greater than the sum of
          the CPU limits for all containers in the group.

       --version-description (string)
          A description for this update to the container group definition.

       --source-version-number (integer)
          The  container  group  definition version to update. The new version
          starts with values from the source version, and then updates  values
          included in this request.

       --operating-system (string)
          The  platform  that all containers in the group use. Containers in a
          group must run on the same operating system.

          NOTE:
              Amazon Linux 2 (AL2) will reach end of support on 6/30/2025. See
              more  details in the Amazon Linux 2 FAQs . For game servers that
              are hosted on AL2 and use Amazon GameLift server SDK 4.x,  first
              update  the game server build to server SDK 5.x, and then deploy
              to AL2023 instances. See Migrate to Amazon GameLift  server  SDK
              version 5.

          Possible values:

          o AMAZON_LINUX_2023

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       ContainerGroupDefinition -> (structure)
          The properties of the updated container group definition version.

          ContainerGroupDefinitionArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN ) that is assigned to an Amazon
              GameLift ContainerGroupDefinition resource. It uniquely  identi-
              fies the resource across all Amazon Web Services Regions. Format
              is     arn:aws:gamelift:[region]::containergroupdefinition/[con-

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A  time stamp indicating when this data object was created. For-
              mat is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for  ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          OperatingSystem -> (string)
              The  platform that all containers in the container group defini-
              tion run on.

              NOTE:
                 Amazon Linux 2 (AL2) will reach end of support on  6/30/2025.
                 See  more  details  in  the  Amazon  Linux  2 FAQs . For game
                 servers that are hosted on AL2 and use Amazon GameLift server
                 SDK  4.x,  first  update  the game server build to server SDK
                 5.x, and then deploy to AL2023 instances. See Migrate to Ama-
                 zon GameLift server SDK version 5.

          Name -> (string)
              A descriptive identifier for the container group definition. The
              name value is unique in an Amazon Web Services Region.

          ContainerGroupType -> (string)
              The type of container group. Container group type determines how
              Amazon  GameLift  deploys  the container group on each fleet in-
              stance.

          TotalMemoryLimitMebibytes -> (integer)
              The amount of memory (in MiB) on a fleet  instance  to  allocate
              for the container group. All containers in the group share these
              resources.

              You can set a limit for each container definition in the  group.
              If  individual  containers have limits, this total value must be
              greater than any individual container's memory limit.

          TotalVcpuLimit -> (double)
              The amount of vCPU units on a fleet instance to allocate for the
              container  group  (1  vCPU is equal to 1024 CPU units). All con-
              tainers in the group share these resources. You can set a  limit
              for  each  container definition in the group. If individual con-
              tainers have limits, this  total  value  must  be  equal  to  or
              greater  than  the  sum  of the limits for each container in the
              group.

          GameServerContainerDefinition -> (structure)
              The definition for the game server container in this group. This
              property   is  used  only  when  the  container  group  type  is
              GAME_SERVER . This container definition  specifies  a  container
              image with the game server build.

              ContainerName -> (string)
                 The  container  definition  identifier.  Container  names are
                 unique within a container group definition.

              DependsOn -> (list)
                 Indicates that the container relies on the  status  of  other
                 containers  in  the  same  container group during startup and
                 shutdown sequences. A container might  have  dependencies  on
                 multiple containers.

                 (structure)
                     A container's dependency on another container in the same
                     container group. The dependency impacts how the dependent
                     container  is able to start or shut down based the status
                     of the other container.

                     For example, ContainerA is configured with the  following
                     dependency: a START dependency on ContainerB . This means
                     that ContainerA can't start until ContainerB has started.
                     It  also means that ContainerA must shut down before Con-
                     tainerB .

                     ContainerName -> (string)
                        A  descriptive label for the container definition that
                        this container depends on.

                     Condition -> (string)
                        The condition that the dependency container must reach
                        before the dependent container can start. Valid condi-
                        tions include:

                        o START - The dependency container must have started.

                        o COMPLETE - The dependency container has run to  com-
                          pletion  (exits).  Use this condition with nonessen-
                          tial containers, such as those that run a script and
                          then  exit. The dependency container can't be an es-
                          sential container.

                        o SUCCESS - The dependency container has run  to  com-

                          dency container can't be an essential container.

                        o HEALTHY - The dependency container  has  passed  its
                          Docker  health check. Use this condition with depen-
                          dency containers that have health checks configured.
                          This  condition  is  confirmed  at  container  group
                          startup only.

              MountPoints -> (list)
                 A mount point that binds a path inside  the  container  to  a
                 file  or  directory on the host system and lets it access the
                 file or directory.

                 (structure)
                     A mount point that binds a container to a file or  direc-
                     tory on the host system.

                        The type of access for the container.

              EnvironmentOverride -> (list)
                 A set of environment variables that's passed to the container
                 on  startup. See the ContainerDefinition::environment parame-
                 ter in the Amazon Elastic Container Service API Reference .

                 (structure)
                     An environment variable to set inside a container, in the
                     form of a key-value pair.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The environment variable name.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The environment variable value.

              ImageUri -> (string)
                 The URI to the image that Amazon GameLift uses when deploying
                 this container to a container  fleet.  For  a  more  specific
                 identifier, see ResolvedImageDigest .

              PortConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  set  of ports that are available to bind to processes in
                 the container. For example, a game server process requires  a
                 container  port  to allow game clients to connect to it. Con-
                 tainer ports aren't directly  accessed  by  inbound  traffic.
                 Amazon  GameLift maps these container ports to externally ac-
                 cessible connection ports, which are assigned as needed  from
                 the container fleet's ConnectionPortRange .

                 ContainerPortRanges -> (list)
                     A  set  of  one or more container port number ranges. The
                     ranges can't overlap.

                     (structure)
                        A set of one or more port numbers that can  be  opened
                        on the container.

                        FromPort -> (integer)
                            A  starting  value  for  the range of allowed port
                            numbers.

                        ToPort -> (integer)
                            An ending value for the range of allowed port num-
                            bers.  Port  numbers are end-inclusive. This value
                            must be equal to or greater than FromPort .

                        Protocol -> (string)
                            The network protocol that these ports support.

              ResolvedImageDigest -> (string)
                 A unique and immutable identifier for  the  container  image.
                 The digest is a SHA 256 hash of the container image manifest.

              ServerSdkVersion -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  GameLift server SDK version that the game server
                 is integrated with. Only game servers using 5.2.0  or  higher
                 are compatible with container fleets.

          SupportContainerDefinitions -> (list)
              The  set  of definitions for support containers in this group. A
              container group definition might  have  zero  support  container
              definitions.  Support  container can be used in any type of con-
              tainer group.

              (structure)
                 Describes a support container in a container group. A support
                 container  might  be  in  a  game server container group or a
                 per-instance container group. Support  containers  don't  run
                 game server processes.

                 You  can update a support container definition and deploy the
                 updates to an existing fleet. When  creating  or  updating  a
                 game  server  container  group  definition,  use the property
                 GameServerContainerDefinitionInput .

                 ContainerName -> (string)
                     The container definition identifier. Container names  are
                     unique within a container group definition.

                 DependsOn -> (list)
                     Indicates  that  the  container  relies  on the status of
                     other containers in the same container group  during  its
                     startup  and  shutdown  sequences. A container might have
                     dependencies on multiple containers.

                     (structure)
                        A container's dependency on another container  in  the
                        same  container  group. The dependency impacts how the
                        dependent container is able  to  start  or  shut  down
                        based the status of the other container.

                        For example, ContainerA is configured with the follow-
                        ing dependency: a START  dependency  on  ContainerB  .
                        This  means  that  ContainerA  can't  start until Con-
                        tainerB has started. It  also  means  that  ContainerA
                        must shut down before ContainerB .

                            that this container depends on.

                        Condition -> (string)
                            The  condition  that the dependency container must
                            reach before the dependent  container  can  start.
                            Valid conditions include:

                            o START  -  The  dependency  container  must  have
                              started.

                            o COMPLETE - The dependency container has  run  to
                              completion  (exits).  Use  this  condition  with
                              nonessential containers, such as those that  run
                              a script and then exit. The dependency container
                              can't be an essential container.

                            o SUCCESS - The dependency container  has  run  to
                              completion  and  exited  with a zero status. The
                              dependency container can't be an essential  con-
                              tainer.

                            o HEALTHY  -  The  dependency container has passed
                              its Docker health check. Use this condition with
                              dependency  containers  that  have health checks
                              configured. This condition is confirmed at  con-
                              tainer group startup only.

                 MountPoints -> (list)
                     A mount point that binds a path inside the container to a

                 Essential -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether the container is vital to the container
                     group. If an essential container fails, the  entire  con-
                     tainer group restarts.

                 HealthCheck -> (structure)
                     A  configuration  for a non-terminal health check. A sup-
                     port container automatically restarts if it  stops  func-

                        (string)

                     Interval -> (integer)
                        The time  period  (in  seconds)  between  each  health
                        check.

                     Retries -> (integer)
                        The number of times to retry a failed health check be-
                        fore flagging the container unhealthy. The  first  run
                        of the command does not count as a retry.

                     StartPeriod -> (integer)
                        The  optional grace period (in seconds) to give a con-

                        health check counts toward the number of retries.

                     Timeout -> (integer)
                        The  time  period  (in  seconds)  to wait for a health
                        check to  succeed  before  counting  a  failed  health
                        check.

                     The amount of memory that Amazon GameLift makes available
                     to the container. If memory limits aren't set for an  in-
                     dividual  container,  the  container shares the container
                     group's total memory allocation.

                     A  set  of  ports that allow access to the container from
                     external users. Processes running in  the  container  can
                     bind  to a one of these ports. Container ports aren't di-
                     rectly accessed by inbound traffic. Amazon GameLift  maps
                     these container ports to externally accessible connection

          Status -> (string)
              Current status of the container group definition resource.  Val-
              ues include:

              o COPYING  -- Amazon GameLift is in the process of making copies
                of all container images that are defined in the  group.  While
                in  this  state,  the  resource can't be used to create a con-
                tainer fleet.

              o READY -- Amazon GameLift has copied the  registry  images  for
                all  containers  that  are defined in the group. You can use a
                container group definition in this status  to  create  a  con-
                tainer fleet.

              o FAILED  --  Amazon GameLift failed to create a valid container
                group definition resource. For more details on  the  cause  of
                the  failure,  see StatusReason . A container group definition
                resource in failed status will be deleted within  a  few  min-
                utes.

          StatusReason -> (string)
              Additional information about a container group definition that's
              in FAILED status. Possible reasons include:

              o An internal issue prevented Amazon GameLift from creating  the
                container  group  definition  resource.  Delete the failed re-
                source and call  CreateContainerGroupDefinition again.

              o An access-denied message means that you don't have permissions
                to access the container image on ECR. See IAM permission exam-
                ples for help setting up required IAM permissions  for  Amazon
                GameLift.

              o The  ImageUri  value for at least one of the containers in the
                container group definition was invalid or  not  found  in  the
                current Amazon Web Services account.

              o At  least  one  of the container images referenced in the con-
                tainer group definition exceeds the  allowed  size.  For  size
                limits, see Amazon GameLift endpoints and quotas .

              o At  least  one  of the container images referenced in the con-
                tainer group definition uses a different operating system than
                the one defined for the container group.
