NAME
       list-container-group-definitions -

DESCRIPTION
          This  operation is used with the Amazon GameLift containers feature,
          which is currently in public preview.

       Retrieves all container group definitions for the Amazon  Web  Services
       account  and  Amazon Web Services Region that are currently in use. You
       can filter the result set by the container groups' scheduling strategy.
       Use  the  pagination parameters to retrieve results in a set of sequen-
       tial pages.

       NOTE:
              This operation returns the list of container  group  definitions
              in no particular order.

       list-container-group-definitions is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: ContainerGroupDefinitions

OPTIONS
       --scheduling-strategy (string)
          The type of container group definitions to retrieve.

          o DAEMON -- Daemon container groups run background processes and are
            deployed once per fleet instance.

          o REPLICA  -- Replica container groups run your game server applica-
            tion and supporting software. Replica  groups  might  be  deployed
            multiple times per fleet instance.

          Possible values:

          o REPLICA

          o DAEMON

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ContainerGroupDefinitions -> (list)
          A result set of container group definitions that match the request.

                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to an Amazon
                 GameLift ContainerGroupDefinition resource. It uniquely iden-
                 tifies  the  resource across all Amazon Web Services Regions.
                 Format  is   arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::containergroupdefini-

              OperatingSystem -> (string)
                 The  platform  required  for  all containers in the container
                 group definition.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon Linux  2  (AL2)  will  reach  end  of  support  on
                     6/30/2025.  See more details in the Amazon Linux 2 FAQs .
                     For game servers that are hosted on AL2  and  use  Amazon
                     GameLift  server  SDK  4.x., first update the game server
                     build to server SDK 5.x, and then deploy  to  AL2023  in-
                     stances.  See  Migrate to Amazon GameLift server SDK ver-
                     sion 5.

              Name -> (string)
                 A descriptive identifier for the container group  definition.
                 The name value is unique in an Amazon Web Services Region.

              SchedulingStrategy -> (string)
                 The method for deploying the container group across fleet in-
                 stances. A replica container group might have multiple copies
                 on  each  fleet  instance. A daemon container group maintains
                 only one copy per fleet instance.

              TotalMemoryLimit -> (integer)
                 The amount of memory (in MiB) on a fleet instance to allocate
                 for  the  container  group. All containers in the group share
                 these resources.

                 You can set additional limits for  each   ContainerDefinition
                 in  the  group.  If  individual  containers have limits, this
                 value must meet the following requirements:

                 o Equal to or greater than the sum of all  container-specific
                   soft memory limits in the group.

                 o Equal to or greater than any container-specific hard limits
                   in the group.

                 For more details on  memory  allocation,  see  the  Container
                 fleet design guide .

              TotalCpuLimit -> (integer)
                 The  amount  of CPU units on a fleet instance to allocate for
                 the container group. All containers in the group share  these
                 resources.  This property is an integer value in CPU units (1
                 vCPU is equal to 1024 CPU units).

                 You can set additional limits for  each   ContainerDefinition
                 in  the  group.  If  individual  containers have limits, this
                 value must be equal to or greater than the sum  of  all  con-
                 tainer-specific CPU limits in the group.

                 For  more  details  on  memory  allocation, see the Container
                 fleet design guide .

              ContainerDefinitions -> (list)
                 The set of container definitions that  are  included  in  the
                 container group.

                 (structure)
                        This  data  type is used with the Amazon GameLift con-
                        tainers feature, which is currently in public preview.

                     Describes a container in a container fleet, the resources
                     available to the container, and the commands that are run
                     when the container starts. Container properties can't  be
                     updated.  To  change  a  property, create a new container
                     group definition. See also  ContainerDefinitionInput .

                     ContainerName -> (string)
                        The  container  definition identifier. Container names
                        are unique within a container group definition.

                     ImageUri -> (string)
                        The URI to the image that $short; copied and  deployed
                        to  a container fleet. For a more specific identifier,

                     ResolvedImageDigest -> (string)
                        A unique and immutable identifier  for  the  container
                        image  that  is deployed to a container fleet. The di-
                        gest is a SHA 256 hash of the  container  image  mani-
                        fest.

                     MemoryLimits -> (structure)
                        The amount of memory that Amazon GameLift makes avail-
                        able to the container. If memory limits aren't set for
                        an individual container, the container shares the con-
                        tainer group's total memory allocation.

                        SoftLimit -> (integer)
                            The  amount  of memory that is reserved for a con-
                            tainer. When the container group's  shared  memory
                            is  under contention, the system attempts to main-
                            tain the  container  memory  usage  at  this  soft
                            limit.  However, the container can use more memory
                            when needed, if available. This property is  simi-
                            lar to the Amazon ECS container definition parame-
                            ter memoryreservation  (Amazon  Elastic  Container
                            Service Developer Guide ).

                        HardLimit -> (integer)
                            The  maximum  amount  of memory that the container
                            can use. If a container attempts  to  exceed  this
                            limit,  the container is stopped. This property is
                            similar to the Amazon ECS container definition pa-
                            rameter  memory  in  the  Amazon Elastic Container

                     PortConfiguration -> (structure)
                        Defines the ports that are available to assign to pro-
                        cesses  in  the  container. For example, a game server
                        process  requires  a  container  port  to  allow  game
                        clients  to  connect to it. Container ports aren't di-
                        rectly accessed by inbound  traffic.  Amazon  GameLift
                        maps  these  container  ports to externally accessible
                        connection ports, which are assigned  as  needed  from
                        the container fleet's ConnectionPortRange .

                        ContainerPortRanges -> (list)
                            Specifies  one  or  more ranges of ports on a con-
                            tainer. These ranges must not overlap.

                     HealthCheck -> (structure)
                        A configuration for a  non-terminal  health  check.  A
                        container,  which  automatically  restarts if it stops
                        functioning, also restarts if  it  fails  this  health
                        check.  If  an essential container in the daemon group
                        fails a health check, the entire  container  group  is
                        restarted.  The  essential  container  in  the replica
                        group doesn't use this health check mechanism, because
                        the  Amazon  GameLift  Agent automatically handles the
                        task.

                            The time period (in seconds) to wait for a  health
                            check  to  succeed before a failed health check is
                            counted.

                        Retries -> (integer)
                            The number of times to retry a failed health check
                            before  the container is considered unhealthy. The
                            first run of the  command  does  not  count  as  a
                            retry.

                        StartPeriod -> (integer)
                            The  optional  grace period (in seconds) to give a
                            container  time  to  bootstrap  before  the  first
                            failed  health  check  counts toward the number of
                            retries.

                     Command -> (list)
                        A command that's passed to the container  on  startup.
                        Each  argument for the command is an additional string
                        in the array. See the ContainerDefinition::command pa-
                        rameter  in  the  Amazon Elastic Container Service API
                        reference.

                        (string)

                     Essential -> (boolean)
                        Indicates whether the container is vital to  the  con-
                        tainer group. If an essential container fails, the en-
                        tire container group is restarted.

                     EntryPoint -> (list)
                        The entry point that's  passed  to  the  container  on
                        startup.  If  there are multiple arguments, each argu-
                        ment is an additional string in  the  array.  See  the
                        ContainerDefinition::entryPoint  parameter in the Ama-
                        zon Elastic Container Service API Reference .

                        (string)

                     WorkingDirectory -> (string)
                        The directory in the container where commands are run.
                        See  the ContainerDefinition::workingDirectory parame-
                        ter in the Amazon Elastic Container Service API Refer-
                        ence .

                     Environment -> (list)
                        A  set  of  environment variables that's passed to the
                        container       on       startup.       See        the
                        ContainerDefinition::environment parameter in the Ama-
                        zon Elastic Container Service API Reference .

                        (structure)
                               This data type is used with the Amazon GameLift
                               containers  feature, which is currently in pub-
                               lic preview.

                            An environment variable to set inside a container,
                            in the form of a key-value pair.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The environment variable name.

                            Value -> (string)
                               The environment variable value.

                     DependsOn -> (list)
                        Indicates that the container relies on the  status  of
                        other  containers  in  the same container group during
                        its startup and shutdown sequences. A container  might
                        have dependencies on multiple containers.

                               This data type is used with the Amazon GameLift
                               containers feature, which is currently in  pub-

                            A  container's  dependency on another container in
                            the same container group. The  dependency  impacts
                            how  the  dependent  container is able to start or
                            shut down based the status of the other container.

                            For example, ContainerA  is  configured  with  the
                            following  dependency:  a START dependency on Con-
                            tainerB. This means that  ContainerA  can't  start
                            until  ContainerB  has started. It also means that
                            ContainerA must shut down before ContainerB.

                            ContainerName -> (string)
                               A descriptive label for the  container  defini-
                               tion that this container depends on.

                            Condition -> (string)
                               The  condition  that  the  dependency container
                               must reach before the dependent  container  can
                               start. Valid conditions include:

                               o START  -  The  dependency container must have
                                 started.

                               o COMPLETE - The dependency container  has  run
                                 to  completion  (exits).  Use  this condition
                                 with nonessential containers, such  as  those
                                 that  run  a script and then exit. The depen-
                                 dency container can't be  an  essential  con-
                                 tainer.

                               o SUCCESS - The dependency container has run to
                                 completion and exited with a zero status. The
                                 dependency  container  can't  be an essential
                                 container.

                               o HEALTHY - The dependency container has passed
                                 its  Docker  health check. Use this condition
                                 with dependency containers that  have  health
                                 checks  configured.  This  condition  is con-
                                 firmed at container group startup only.

              Status -> (string)
                 Current status of the container  group  definition  resource.
                 Values include:

                 o COPYING  --  Amazon  GameLift  is  in the process of making
                   copies of all container images  that  are  defined  in  the
                   group.  While  in this state, the resource can't be used to
                   create a container fleet.

                 o READY -- Amazon GameLift has copied the registry images for
                   all containers that are defined in the group. You can use a
                   container group definition in this status to create a  con-
                   tainer fleet.

                 o FAILED  --  Amazon  GameLift  failed to create a valid con-
                   tainer group definition resource. For more details  on  the
                   cause  of the failure, see StatusReason . A container group
                   definition resource in failed status will be deleted within
                   a few minutes.

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 Additional  information  about  a  container group definition
                 that's in FAILED status. Possible reasons include:

                 o An internal issue prevented Amazon GameLift  from  creating
                   the  container group definition resource. Delete the failed
                   resource and call  CreateContainerGroupDefinition again.

                 o An access-denied message means that you don't have  permis-
                   sions to access the container image on ECR. See IAM permis-
                   sion examples for help setting up required IAM  permissions
                   for Amazon GameLift.

                 o The  ImageUri  value  for at least one of the containers in
                   the container group definition was invalid or not found  in
                   the current Amazon Web Services account.

                 o At least one of the container images referenced in the con-
                   tainer group definition exceeds the allowed size. For  size
                   limits, see Amazon GameLift endpoints and quotas .

                 o At least one of the container images referenced in the con-
                   tainer group definition uses a different  operating  system
                   than the one defined for the container group.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
