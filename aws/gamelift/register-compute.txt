REGISTER-COMPUTE()                                          REGISTER-COMPUTE()



NAME
       register-compute -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers a compute resource in an Amazon GameLift Anywhere fleet.

       For  an  Anywhere  fleet  that's running the Amazon GameLift Agent, the
       Agent handles all compute registry tasks for you. For an Anywhere fleet
       that  doesn't use the Agent, call this operation to register fleet com-
       putes.

       To register a compute, give the compute a name (must be  unique  within
       the  fleet)  and specify the compute resource's DNS name or IP address.
       Provide a fleet ID and a fleet location to associate with  the  compute
       being registered. You can optionally include the path to a TLS certifi-
       cate on the compute resource.

       If successful, this operation returns  compute  details,  including  an
       Amazon  GameLift  SDK endpoint or Agent endpoint. Game server processes
       running on the compute can use this endpoint to  communicate  with  the
       Amazon  GameLift service. Each server process includes the SDK endpoint
       in its call to the Amazon GameLift server SDK action InitSDK() .

       To view compute details, call DescribeCompute with the compute name.

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to register the  compute  to.  You
          can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --compute-name (string)
          A descriptive label for the compute resource.

       --certificate-path (string)
          The  path  to  a  TLS  certificate  on your compute resource. Amazon
          GameLift doesn't validate the path and certificate.

       --dns-name (string)
          The DNS name of the compute resource. Amazon GameLift  requires  ei-
          ther a DNS name or IP address.

       --ip-address (string)
          The IP address of the compute resource. Amazon GameLift requires ei-
          ther a DNS name or IP address. When registering an  Anywhere  fleet,
          an IP address is required.

       --location (string)
          The name of a custom location to associate with the compute resource
          being registered. This parameter is required when registering a com-
          pute for an Anywhere fleet.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Compute -> (structure)
          The details of the compute resource you registered.

          FleetId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the fleet that the compute belongs to.

          FleetArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the fleet that the compute be-
              longs to.

          ComputeName -> (string)
              A descriptive label for the compute resource. For instances in a
              managed EC2 fleet, the compute name is the same value as the In-
              stanceId ID.

          ComputeArn -> (string)
              The ARN that is assigned to  a  compute  resource  and  uniquely
              identifies  it.  ARNs  are unique across locations. Instances in
              managed EC2 fleets are not assigned a Compute ARN.

          IpAddress -> (string)
              The IP address of a compute resource. Amazon GameLift requires a
              DNS name or IP address for a compute.

          DnsName -> (string)
              The  DNS  name of a compute resource. Amazon GameLift requires a
              DNS name or IP address for a compute.

          ComputeStatus -> (string)
              Current status of the compute. A compute  must  have  an  ACTIVE
              status to host game sessions.

          Location -> (string)
              The name of the custom location you added to the fleet that this
              compute resource resides in.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A time stamp indicating when this data object was created.  For-
              mat  is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          OperatingSystem -> (string)
              The type of operating system on the compute resource.

              NOTE:
                 Amazon Linux 2 (AL2) will reach end of support on  6/30/2025.
                 See  more  details  in  the  Amazon  Linux  2 FAQs . For game
                 servers that are hosted on AL2 and use Amazon GameLift server
                 SDK  4.x.,  first  update the game server build to server SDK
                 5.x, and then deploy to AL2023 instances. See Migrate to Ama-
                 zon GameLift server SDK version 5.

          Type -> (string)
              The Amazon EC2 instance type that the fleet uses. For registered
              computes in an Amazon GameLift Anywhere fleet, this property  is
              empty.

          GameLiftServiceSdkEndpoint -> (string)
              The  Amazon  GameLift  SDK  endpoint connection for a registered
              compute resource in an Anywhere fleet. The game servers  on  the
              compute use this endpoint to connect to the Amazon GameLift ser-
              vice.

          GameLiftAgentEndpoint -> (string)
              The endpoint of the Amazon GameLift Agent.

          InstanceId -> (string)
              The InstanceID of the EC2 instance that is hosting the compute.

          ContainerAttributes -> (list)
              A set of attributes for each container in the compute.

              (structure)
                 A unique identifier for a container in a container fleet com-
                 pute.
                     Returned by:   DescribeCompute

                 ContainerName -> (string)
                     The  identifier  for a container that's running in a com-
                     pute.

                 ContainerRuntimeId -> (string)
                     The runtime ID for the container that's running in a com-
                     pute. This value is unique within the compute.

          GameServerContainerGroupDefinitionArn -> (string)
              The game server container group definition for the compute.
