REGISTER-COMPUTE()                                          REGISTER-COMPUTE()



NAME
       register-compute -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers your compute resources in a fleet you previously created. Af-
       ter you register a compute to your fleet, you can  monitor  and  manage
       your  compute  using Amazon GameLift. The operation returns the compute
       resource containing SDK endpoint you  can  use  to  connect  your  game
       server to Amazon GameLift.

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for the fleet to register the compute to. You
          can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --compute-name (string)
          A descriptive label that is associated  with  the  compute  resource
          registered to your fleet.

       --certificate-path (string)
          The  path  to the TLS certificate on your compute resource. The path
          and certificate are not validated by Amazon GameLift.

       --dns-name (string)
          The DNS name of the compute resource. Amazon GameLift  requires  the
          DNS name or IP address to manage your compute resource.

       --ip-address (string)
          The IP address of the compute resource. Amazon GameLift requires the
          DNS name or IP address to manage your compute resource.

       --location (string)
          The name of the custom location you added to the fleet you are  reg-
          istering this compute resource to.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Compute -> (structure)
          The details of the compute resource you registered to the  specified
          fleet.

          FleetId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the fleet that the compute is registered
              to.

          FleetArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the fleet that the compute  is
              registered to.

          ComputeName -> (string)
              A descriptive label that is associated with the compute resource
              registered to your fleet.

          ComputeArn -> (string)
              The ARN that is assigned to the compute  resource  and  uniquely
              identifies it. ARNs are unique across locations.

          IpAddress -> (string)
              The IP address of the compute resource. Amazon GameLift requires
              the DNS name or IP address to manage your compute resource.

          DnsName -> (string)
              The DNS name of the compute resource. Amazon  GameLift  requires
              the DNS name or IP address to manage your compute resource.

          ComputeStatus -> (string)
              Current  status  of  the  compute. A compute must have an ACTIVE
              status to host game sessions.

          Location -> (string)
              The name of the custom location you added to the fleet that this
              compute resource resides in.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A  time stamp indicating when this data object was created. For-
              mat is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for  ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          OperatingSystem -> (string)
              The type of operating system on your compute resource.

          Type -> (string)
              The  compute  type that the fleet uses. A fleet can use Anywhere
              compute resources that you own, or use managed  Amazon  EC2  in-
              stances.

          GameLiftServiceSdkEndpoint -> (string)
              The  endpoint connection details of the Amazon GameLift SDK end-
              point that your game server connects to.
