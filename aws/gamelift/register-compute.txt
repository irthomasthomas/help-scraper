REGISTER-COMPUTE()                                          REGISTER-COMPUTE()



NAME
       register-compute -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers a compute resource to an Amazon GameLift Anywhere fleet. With
       Anywhere fleets you can incorporate your own computing hardware into an
       Amazon GameLift game hosting solution.

       To  register  a  compute  to  a fleet, give the compute a name (must be
       unique within the fleet) and specify the compute resource's DNS name or
       IP address. Provide the Anywhere fleet ID and a fleet location to asso-
       ciate with the compute being registered. You can optionally include the
       path to a TLS certificate on the compute resource.

       If successful, this operation returns the compute details, including an
       Amazon GameLift SDK endpoint. Game server processes  that  run  on  the
       compute  use this endpoint to communicate with the Amazon GameLift ser-
       vice. Each server process includes the SDK endpoint in its call to  the
       Amazon GameLift server SDK action InitSDK() .

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for the fleet to register the compute to. You
          can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --compute-name (string)
          A descriptive label for the compute resource.

       --certificate-path (string)
          The path to a TLS  certificate  on  your  compute  resource.  Amazon
          GameLift doesn't validate the path and certificate.

       --dns-name (string)
          The  DNS  name of the compute resource. Amazon GameLift requires ei-
          ther a DNS name or IP address.

       --ip-address (string)
          The IP address of the compute resource. Amazon GameLift requires ei-
          ther a DNS name or IP address.

       --location (string)
          The name of a custom location to associate with the compute resource
          being registered.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Compute -> (structure)
          The details of the compute resource you registered.

          FleetId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the fleet that the compute belongs to.

          FleetArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the fleet that the compute be-
              longs to.

          ComputeName -> (string)
              A descriptive label for the compute resource. For instances in a
              managed EC2 fleet, the compute name is an instance ID.

          ComputeArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  that  is  assigned  to a compute resource and uniquely
              identifies it. ARNs are unique across  locations.  Instances  in
              managed EC2 fleets are not assigned a ComputeARN.

          IpAddress -> (string)
              The IP address of a compute resource. Amazon GameLift requires a
              DNS name or IP address for a compute.

          DnsName -> (string)
              The DNS name of a compute resource. Amazon GameLift  requires  a
              DNS name or IP address for a compute.

          ComputeStatus -> (string)
              Current  status  of  the  compute. A compute must have an ACTIVE
              status to host game sessions.

          Location -> (string)
              The name of the custom location you added to the fleet that this
              compute resource resides in.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A  time stamp indicating when this data object was created. For-
              mat is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for  ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          OperatingSystem -> (string)
              The type of operating system on the compute resource.

          Type -> (string)
              The Amazon EC2 instance type that the fleet uses. For registered
              computes in an Amazon GameLift Anywhere fleet, this property  is
              empty.

          GameLiftServiceSdkEndpoint -> (string)
              The  Amazon  GameLift  SDK  endpoint connection for a registered
              compute resource in an Anywhere fleet. The game servers  on  the
              compute use this endpoint to connect to the Amazon GameLift ser-
              vice.
