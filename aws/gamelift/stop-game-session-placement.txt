OPTIONS
       --placement-id (string)
          A unique identifier for a game session placement to stop.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GameSessionPlacement -> (structure)
          Object that describes the canceled game session placement, with CAN-
          CELLED status and an end time stamp.

          PlacementId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for a game session placement.

          GameSessionQueueName -> (string)
              A  descriptive label that is associated with game session queue.
              Queue names must be unique within each Region.

          Status -> (string)
              Current status of the game session placement request.

              o PENDING -- The placement request is in the queue waiting to be
                processed. Game session properties are not yet final.

              o FULFILLED  -- A new game session has been successfully placed.
                Game session properties are now final.

              o CANCELLED -- The placement request was canceled.

              o TIMED_OUT -- A new game session was not  successfully  created
                before  the time limit expired. You can resubmit the placement
                request as needed.

              o FAILED -- Amazon GameLift is not able to complete the  process
                of  placing the game session. Common reasons are the game ses-
                sion terminated before the placement process was completed, or
                an unexpected internal error.

          GameProperties -> (list)
              A  set  of  custom  properties  for a game session, formatted as
              key:value pairs. These properties are passed to  a  game  server
              process  with a request to start a new game session (see Start a
              Game Session ).

              (structure)
                 Set of key-value pairs that contain information about a  game
                 session. When included in a game session request, these prop-
                 erties communicate details to be used when setting up the new
                 game  session.  For  example, a game property might specify a
                 game mode, level, or map. Game properties are passed  to  the
                 game  server  process when initiating a new game session. For
                 more information, see the Amazon GameLift Developer Guide .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The game property identifier.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The game property value.

          MaximumPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)
              The maximum number of players that can be  connected  simultane-
              ously to the game session.

          GameSessionName -> (string)
              A descriptive label that is associated with a game session. Ses-
              sion names do not need to be unique.

          GameSessionId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the game session. This value isn't final
              until placement status is FULFILLED .

          GameSessionArn -> (string)
              Identifier  for  the  game session created by this placement re-
              quest. This identifier is unique across all Regions. This  value
              isn't final until placement status is FULFILLED .

          GameSessionRegion -> (string)
              Name of the Region where the game session created by this place-
              ment request is running. This value isn't final until  placement
              status is FULFILLED .

          PlayerLatencies -> (list)
              A  set  of values, expressed in milliseconds, that indicates the
              amount of latency that a player experiences  when  connected  to
              Amazon Web Services Regions.

              (structure)
                 Regional latency information for a player, used when request-
                 ing a new game session. This value indicates  the  amount  of
                 time  lag that exists when the player is connected to a fleet
                 in the specified Region. The relative  difference  between  a
                 player's  latency values for multiple Regions are used to de-
                 termine which fleets are best suited to place a new game ses-
                 sion for the player.

                 PlayerId -> (string)
                     A  unique identifier for a player associated with the la-
                     tency data.

                 RegionIdentifier -> (string)
                     Name of the Region that is associated  with  the  latency
                     value.

                 LatencyInMilliseconds -> (float)
                     Amount  of  time that represents the time lag experienced
                     by the player when connected to the specified Region.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              Time stamp indicating when this request was placed in the queue.
              Format  is  a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for
              example "1469498468.057" ).

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              Time stamp indicating when this request was completed, canceled,
              or timed out.

          IpAddress -> (string)
              The  IP  address  of  the  game  session. To connect to a Amazon
              GameLift game server, an app needs both the IP address and  port
              number.  This  value  isn't final until placement status is FUL-
              FILLED .

          DnsName -> (string)
              The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is running  the
              game session. Values have the following format:

              o TLS-enabled   fleets:   <unique   identifier>.<region  identi-
                fier>.amazongamelift.com .

              o Non-TLS-enabled fleets:  ec2-<unique  identifier>.compute.ama-
                zonaws.com . (See Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing .)

              When  connecting  to a game session that is running on a TLS-en-
              abled fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP address.

          Port -> (integer)
              The port number for the game session. To  connect  to  a  Amazon
              GameLift  game server, an app needs both the IP address and port
              number. This value isn't final until placement  status  is  FUL-
              FILLED .

          PlacedPlayerSessions -> (list)
              A  collection  of  information on player sessions created in re-
              sponse to the game session placement request. These player  ses-
              sions  are created only after a new game session is successfully
              placed (placement status is FULFILLED ).  This  information  in-
              cludes  the  player ID, provided in the placement request, and a
              corresponding player session ID.

              (structure)
                 Information about a player session. This object contains only
                 the player ID and player session ID. To retrieve full details
                 on a player session,  call  DescribePlayerSessions  with  the
                 player session ID.

                 PlayerId -> (string)
                     A  unique identifier for a player that is associated with
                     this player session.

                 PlayerSessionId -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for a player session.

          GameSessionData -> (string)
              A set of custom game session properties, formatted as  a  single
              string  value.  This  data is passed to a game server process in
              the GameSession object with a request to start a new  game  ses-
              sion (see Start a Game Session ).

          MatchmakerData -> (string)
              Information on the matchmaking process for this game. Data is in
              JSON syntax, formatted as a string. It identifies the  matchmak-
              ing configuration used to create the match, and contains data on
              all players assigned to the match, including  player  attributes
              and  team  assignments. For more details on matchmaker data, see
              Match Data .
