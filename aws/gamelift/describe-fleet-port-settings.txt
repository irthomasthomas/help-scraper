DESCRIBE-FLEET-PORT-SETTINGS()                  DESCRIBE-FLEET-PORT-SETTINGS()



NAME
       describe-fleet-port-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a fleet's inbound connection permissions. Inbound permissions
       specify IP addresses and port settings that incoming traffic can use to
       access  server  processes  in the fleet. Game server processes that are
       running in the fleet must use a port that falls within this  range.  To
       connect to game server processes on a managed container fleet, the port
       settings should include one or more of the container fleet's connection
       ports.

       Use this operation in the following ways:

       o To  retrieve  the  port  settings  for  a fleet, identify the fleet's
         unique identifier.

       o To check the status of recent updates to  a  fleet  remote  location,
         specify  the  fleet  ID and a location. Port setting updates can take
         time to propagate across all locations.

       If successful, a set of IpPermission objects is returned  for  the  re-
       quested  fleet ID. When specifying a location, this operation returns a
       pending status. If the requested fleet has been deleted, the result set
       is empty.

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to retrieve port settings for. You
          can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --location (string)
          A remote location to check for status of port setting  updates.  Use
          the Amazon Web Services Region code format, such as us-west-2 .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view inbound connection permissions for a fleet

       The following describe-fleet-port-settings example retrieves connection
       settings for a specified fleet.

          aws gamelift describe-fleet-port-settings \
              --fleet-id arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::fleet/fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that was requested.

       FleetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN  )  that  is  assigned  to  a  Amazon
          GameLift  fleet resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique
          across    all    Regions.    Format     is     arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
          gion>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .

       InboundPermissions -> (list)
          The port settings for the requested fleet ID.

          (structure)
              A  range  of  IP  addresses and port settings that allow inbound
              traffic to connect to processes on an instance in a fleet.  Pro-
              cesses are assigned an IP address/port number combination, which
              must fall into the fleet's allowed ranges. For managed container
              fleets,  the port settings must use the same port numbers as the
              fleet's connection ports.

              For Realtime Servers fleets, Amazon GameLift automatically opens
              two port ranges, one for TCP messaging and one for UDP.

              FromPort -> (integer)
                 A starting value for a range of allowed port numbers.

                 For  fleets  using Linux builds, only ports 22 and 1026-60000
                 are valid.

                 For fleets using Windows builds, only  ports  1026-60000  are
                 valid.

              ToPort -> (integer)
                 An  ending  value  for  a range of allowed port numbers. Port
                 numbers are end-inclusive. This value must  be  equal  to  or
                 greater than FromPort .

                 For  fleets  using Linux builds, only ports 22 and 1026-60000
                 are valid.

                 For fleets using Windows builds, only  ports  1026-60000  are
                 valid.

              IpRange -> (string)
                 A range of allowed IP addresses. This value must be expressed
                 in CIDR notation. Example: "000.000.000.000/[subnet  mask]  "
                 or optionally the shortened version "0.0.0.0/[subnet mask] ".

              Protocol -> (string)
                 The network communication protocol used by the fleet.

       UpdateStatus -> (string)
          The  current  status  of updates to the fleet's port settings in the
          requested fleet location. A status of PENDING_UPDATE indicates  that
          an update was requested for the fleet but has not yet been completed
          for the location.

       Location -> (string)
          The requested fleet location, expressed as an  Amazon  Web  Services
          Region code, such as us-west-2 .
