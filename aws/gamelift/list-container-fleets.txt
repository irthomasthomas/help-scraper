LIST-CONTAINER-FLEETS()                                LIST-CONTAINER-FLEETS()



NAME
       list-container-fleets -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  collection  of container fleet resources in an Amazon Web
       Services Region. For fleets that have multiple locations,  this  opera-
       tion retrieves fleets based on their home Region only.
          Request options

       o Get  a  list  of all fleets. Call this operation without specifying a
         container group definition.

       o Get a list of fleets filtered by container group definition.  Provide
         the container group definition name or ARN value.

       o To get a list of all Realtime Servers fleets with a specific configu-
         ration script, provide the script ID.

       Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set  of  sequen-
       tial pages.

       If  successful, this operation returns a collection of container fleets
       that match the request parameters. A NextToken value is  also  returned
       if there are more result pages to retrieve.

       NOTE:
          Fleet IDs are returned in no particular order.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-container-fleets  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ContainerFleets

OPTIONS
       --container-group-definition-name (string)
          The container group definition to filter the list on. Use  this  pa-
          rameter  to  retrieve  only those fleets that use the specified con-
          tainer group definition. You can specify the container group defini-
          tion's  name  to get fleets with the latest versions. Alternatively,
          provide an ARN value to get fleets with a specific version number.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ContainerFleets -> (list)
          A  collection  of  container fleet objects for all fleets that match
          the request criteria.

          (structure)
              Describes an Amazon GameLift managed container fleet.

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the container fleet to retrieve.

              FleetArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a  Amazon
                 GameLift  fleet resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are
                 unique across all Regions.  Format  is  arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
                 gion>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912  . In
                 a GameLift fleet ARN, the resource  ID  matches  the  FleetId
                 value.

              FleetRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  unique  identifier for an Identity and Access Management
                 (IAM) role with permissions to run  your  containers  on  re-
                 sources  that  are  managed by Amazon GameLift. See Set up an
                 IAM service role . This fleet property can't be changed.

              GameServerContainerGroupDefinitionName -> (string)
                 The name of the fleet's game server container  group  defini-
                 tion, which describes how to deploy containers with your game
                 server build and support software onto each fleet instance.

              GameServerContainerGroupDefinitionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN  )  that  is  assigned  to  the
                 fleet's game server container group. The ARN value also iden-
                 tifies the specific container  group  definition  version  in
                 use.

              PerInstanceContainerGroupDefinitionName -> (string)
                 The  name of the fleet's per-instance container group defini-
                 tion.

              PerInstanceContainerGroupDefinitionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN  )  that  is  assigned  to  the
                 fleet's  per-instance  container  group.  The  ARN value also
                 identifies the specific container group definition version in
                 use.

              InstanceConnectionPortRange -> (structure)
                 The  set  of  port numbers to open on each instance in a con-
                 tainer fleet. Connection ports are used by inbound traffic to
                 connect  with processes that are running in containers on the
                 fleet.

                 FromPort -> (integer)
                     Starting value for the port range.

                 ToPort -> (integer)
                     Ending value for the port. Port  numbers  are  end-inclu-
                     sive.  This  value  must  be  equal  to  or  greater than
                     FromPort .

              InstanceInboundPermissions -> (list)
                 The IP address ranges and port settings  that  allow  inbound
                 traffic  to  access game server processes and other processes
                 on this fleet.

                 (structure)
                     A range of IP addresses and port settings that allow  in-
                     bound traffic to connect to processes on an instance in a
                     fleet. Processes are assigned an IP  address/port  number
                     combination,  which  must  fall  into the fleet's allowed
                     ranges. For managed container fleets, the  port  settings
                     must  use the same port numbers as the fleet's connection
                     ports.

                     For Realtime Servers fleets,  Amazon  GameLift  automati-
                     cally  opens  two  port ranges, one for TCP messaging and
                     one for UDP.

                     FromPort -> (integer)
                        A starting value for a range of allowed port numbers.

                        For fleets using  Linux  builds,  only  ports  22  and
                        1026-60000 are valid.

                        For fleets using Windows builds, only ports 1026-60000
                        are valid.

                     ToPort -> (integer)
                        An ending value for a range of allowed  port  numbers.
                        Port  numbers  are  end-inclusive.  This value must be
                        equal to or greater than FromPort .

                        For fleets using  Linux  builds,  only  ports  22  and
                        1026-60000 are valid.

                        For fleets using Windows builds, only ports 1026-60000
                        are valid.

                     IpRange -> (string)
                        A range of allowed IP addresses. This  value  must  be
                        expressed      in      CIDR     notation.     Example:
                        "000.000.000.000/[subnet mask]  "  or  optionally  the
                        shortened version "0.0.0.0/[subnet mask] ".

                     Protocol -> (string)

                 The  number  of  times to replicate the game server container
                 group on each fleet instance.

              MaximumGameServerContainerGroupsPerInstance -> (integer)
                 The calculated maximum number of game server container  group
                 that  can be deployed on each fleet instance. The calculation
                 depends on the resource needs of the container group and  the
                 CPU and memory resources of the fleet's instance type.

              InstanceType -> (string)
                 The  Amazon EC2 instance type to use for all instances in the
                 fleet. Instance type determines the computing  resources  and
                 processing  power that's available to host your game servers.
                 This includes including CPU, memory, storage, and  networking
                 capacity. You can't update this fleet property.

              BillingType -> (string)
                 Indicates  whether the fleet uses On-Demand or Spot instances
                 for this fleet. Learn more about when to use On-Demand versus
                 Spot Instances . You can't update this fleet property.

                 By default, this property is set to ON_DEMAND .

              Description -> (string)
                 A meaningful description of the container fleet.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  time  stamp  indicating when this data object was created.
                 Format is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              MetricGroups -> (list)
                 The name of an Amazon Web Services CloudWatch metric group to
                 add this fleet to. Metric groups aggregate metrics for multi-
                 ple fleets.

                 (string)

              NewGameSessionProtectionPolicy -> (string)
                 Determines  whether  Amazon  GameLift can shut down game ses-
                 sions on the fleet that  are  actively  running  and  hosting
                 players.  Amazon  GameLift  might prompt an instance shutdown
                 when scaling down fleet capacity or when  retiring  unhealthy
                 instances. You can also set game session protection for indi-
                 vidual game sessions using UpdateGameSession .

                 o NoProtection -- Game sessions can be shut down  during  ac-
                   tive gameplay.

                 o FullProtection  --  Game sessions in ACTIVE status can't be
                   shut down.

              GameSessionCreationLimitPolicy -> (structure)
                 A policy that limits the number of game  sessions  that  each
                 individual  player can create on instances in this fleet. The
                 limit applies for a specified span of time.

                 NewGameSessionsPerCreator -> (integer)
                     A policy that puts limits on the number of game  sessions
                     that a player can create within a specified span of time.
                     With this policy, you can  control  players'  ability  to
                     consume available resources.

                     The  policy evaluates when a player tries to create a new
                     game session. On receiving a  CreateGameSession  request,
                     Amazon  GameLift  checks  that  the player (identified by
                     CreatorId ) has created fewer than game session limit  in
                     the specified time period.

                 PolicyPeriodInMinutes -> (integer)
                     The  time  span  used in evaluating the resource creation
                     limit policy.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of the container fleet.

                 o PENDING -- A new container fleet has been requested.

                 o CREATING -- A new container fleet resource  is  being  cre-
                   ated.

                 o CREATED -- A new container fleet resource has been created.
                   No fleet instances have been deployed.

                 o ACTIVATING -- New container fleet instances are  being  de-
                   ployed.

                 o ACTIVE  --  The  container  fleet  has been deployed and is
                   ready to host game sessions.

                 o UPDATING -- Updates to the container  fleet  is  being  up-
                   dated. A deployment is in progress.

                 fleet.  Amazon  GameLift  saves  all standard output for each
                 container in logs, including game session logs.

                 o CLOUDWATCH -- Send logs to an Amazon CloudWatch  log  group
                   that  you  define. Each container emits a log stream, which
                   is organized in the log group.

                 o S3 -- Store logs in an Amazon S3 bucket that you define.

                 o NONE -- Don't collect container logs.

                 LogDestination -> (string)
                     The type of log collection to use for a fleet.

                     o CLOUDWATCH -- (default value) Send logs  to  an  Amazon
                       CloudWatch  log  group  that you define. Each container
                       emits a log stream,  which  is  organized  in  the  log
                       group.

                     o S3  --  Store  logs in an Amazon S3 bucket that you de-
                       fine.

                     o NONE -- Don't collect container logs.

                 S3BucketName -> (string)
                     If log destination is S3 , logs are sent to the specified
                     Amazon S3 bucket name.

                 LogGroupArn -> (string)
                     If  log  destination is CLOUDWATCH , logs are sent to the
                     specified log group in Amazon CloudWatch.

              LocationAttributes -> (list)
                 Information about  the  container  fleet's  remote  locations
