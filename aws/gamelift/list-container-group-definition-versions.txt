LIST-CONTAINER-GROUP-DEFINITION-VERSLIST-CONTAINER-GROUP-DEFINITION-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-container-group-definition-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves all versions of a container group definition. Use the pagina-
       tion parameters to retrieve results in a set of sequential pages.
          Request options:

       o Get all versions of a specified container group  definition.  Specify
         the  container  group definition name or ARN value. (If the ARN value
         has a version number, it's ignored.)
          Results:

       If successful, this operation returns the complete properties of a  set
       of container group definition versions that match the request.

       NOTE:
              This  operation  returns the list of container group definitions
              in descending version order (latest first).

       list-container-group-definition-versions is a paginated operation. Mul-
       tiple  API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set
       of results. You can disable pagination by providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ContainerGroupDefinitions

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The unique identifier for the container group definition to retrieve
          properties for. You can use either the Name or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ContainerGroupDefinitions -> (list)
          A result set of container group definitions that match the request.

          (structure)
              The properties that describe a container group resource. You can
              update all properties of a container  group  definition  proper-
              ties.  Updates  to a container group definition are saved as new
              versions.

              ContainerGroupDefinitionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to an Amazon
                 GameLift ContainerGroupDefinition resource. It uniquely iden-
                 tifies  the  resource across all Amazon Web Services Regions.
                 Format  is   arn:aws:gamelift:[region]::containergroupdefini-
                 tion/[container group definition name]:[version] .

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  time  stamp  indicating when this data object was created.
                 Format is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              OperatingSystem -> (string)
                 The platform that all containers in the container group defi-
                 nition run on.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon Linux  2  (AL2)  will  reach  end  of  support  on
                     6/30/2025.  See more details in the Amazon Linux 2 FAQs .
                     For game servers that are hosted on AL2  and  use  Amazon
                     GameLift  server  SDK  4.x,  first update the game server
                     build to server SDK 5.x, and then deploy  to  AL2023  in-
                     stances.  See  Migrate to Amazon GameLift server SDK ver-
                     sion 5.

              Name -> (string)
                 A descriptive identifier for the container group  definition.
                 The name value is unique in an Amazon Web Services Region.

              ContainerGroupType -> (string)
                 The  type of container group. Container group type determines
                 how Amazon GameLift deploys the container group on each fleet
                 instance.

              TotalMemoryLimitMebibytes -> (integer)
                 The amount of memory (in MiB) on a fleet instance to allocate
                 for the container group. All containers in  the  group  share
                 these resources.

                 You  can  set  a  limit  for each container definition in the
                 group. If individual containers have limits, this total value
                 must be greater than any individual container's memory limit.

              TotalVcpuLimit -> (double)
                 The  amount of vCPU units on a fleet instance to allocate for
                 the container group (1 vCPU is equal to 1024 CPU units).  All
                 containers  in the group share these resources. You can set a
                 limit for each container definition in the group. If individ-
                 ual containers have limits, this total value must be equal to
                 or greater than the sum of the limits for each  container  in
                 the group.

              GameServerContainerDefinition -> (structure)
                 The  definition  for the game server container in this group.
                 This property is used only when the container group  type  is
                 GAME_SERVER . This container definition specifies a container
                 image with the game server build.

                 ContainerName -> (string)
                     The container definition identifier. Container names  are
                     unique within a container group definition.

                 DependsOn -> (list)
                     Indicates  that  the  container  relies  on the status of
                     other containers  in  the  same  container  group  during
                     startup  and  shutdown  sequences. A container might have
                     dependencies on multiple containers.

                     (structure)
                        A container's dependency on another container  in  the
                        same  container  group. The dependency impacts how the
                        dependent container is able  to  start  or  shut  down
                        based the status of the other container.

                        For example, ContainerA is configured with the follow-
                        ing dependency: a START  dependency  on  ContainerB  .
                        This  means  that  ContainerA  can't  start until Con-
                        tainerB has started. It  also  means  that  ContainerA
                        must shut down before ContainerB .

                        ContainerName -> (string)
                            A descriptive label for the  container  definition
                            that this container depends on.

                        Condition -> (string)
                            The  condition  that the dependency container must
                            reach before the dependent  container  can  start.
                            Valid conditions include:

                            o START  -  The  dependency  container  must  have
                              started.

                            o COMPLETE - The dependency container has  run  to
                              completion  (exits).  Use  this  condition  with
                              nonessential containers, such as those that  run
                              a script and then exit. The dependency container
                              can't be an essential container.

                            o SUCCESS - The dependency container  has  run  to
                              completion  and  exited  with a zero status. The
                              dependency container can't be an essential  con-
                              tainer.

                            o HEALTHY  -  The  dependency container has passed
                              its Docker health check. Use this condition with
                              dependency  containers  that  have health checks
                              configured. This condition is confirmed at  con-
                              tainer group startup only.

                 MountPoints -> (list)
                     A mount point that binds a path inside the container to a
                     file or directory on the host system and lets  it  access
                     the file or directory.

                     (structure)
                        A  mount point that binds a container to a file or di-
                        rectory on the host system.

                        InstancePath -> (string)
                            The path to the source file or directory.

                        ContainerPath -> (string)
                            The mount path on the container. If this  property
                            isn't set, the instance path is used.

                        AccessLevel -> (string)
                            The type of access for the container.

                 EnvironmentOverride -> (list)
                     A  set of environment variables that's passed to the con-
                     tainer        on         startup.         See         the
                     ContainerDefinition::environment  parameter in the Amazon
                     Elastic Container Service API Reference .

                     (structure)
                        An environment variable to set inside a container,  in
                        the form of a key-value pair.

                        Name -> (string)
                            The environment variable name.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The environment variable value.

                 ImageUri -> (string)
                     The  URI  to the image that Amazon GameLift uses when de-
                     ploying this container to a container fleet. For  a  more
                     specific identifier, see ResolvedImageDigest .

                 PortConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The  set of ports that are available to bind to processes
                     in the container. For example, a game server process  re-
                     quires  a container port to allow game clients to connect
                     to it. Container ports aren't directly  accessed  by  in-
                     bound traffic. Amazon GameLift maps these container ports
                     to externally accessible connection ports, which are  as-
                     signed  as  needed from the container fleet's Connection-
                     PortRange .

                     ContainerPortRanges -> (list)
                        A set of one or more container port number ranges. The
                        ranges can't overlap.

                        (structure)
                            A  set  of  one  or  more port numbers that can be
                            opened on the container.

                            FromPort -> (integer)
                               A starting value for the range of allowed  port
                               numbers.

                            ToPort -> (integer)
                               An  ending  value for the range of allowed port
                               numbers. Port numbers are  end-inclusive.  This
                               value must be equal to or greater than FromPort
                               .

                            Protocol -> (string)
                               The network protocol that these ports support.

                 ResolvedImageDigest -> (string)
                     A unique and immutable identifier for the  container  im-
                     age.  The digest is a SHA 256 hash of the container image
                     manifest.

                 ServerSdkVersion -> (string)
                     The Amazon GameLift server  SDK  version  that  the  game
                     server  is integrated with. Only game servers using 5.2.0
                     or higher are compatible with container fleets.

              SupportContainerDefinitions -> (list)
                 The set of definitions for support containers in this  group.
                 A  container  group  definition  might have zero support con-
                 tainer definitions. Support container can be used in any type
                 of container group.

                 (structure)
                     Describes  a  support  container  in a container group. A
                     support container might be in  a  game  server  container
                     group or a per-instance container group. Support contain-
                     ers don't run game server processes.

                     You can update a support container definition and  deploy
                     the updates to an existing fleet. When creating or updat-
                     ing a game server container  group  definition,  use  the
                     property  GameServerContainerDefinitionInput .

                     ContainerName -> (string)
                        The  container  definition identifier. Container names
                        are unique within a container group definition.

                     DependsOn -> (list)
                        Indicates that the container relies on the  status  of
                        other  containers  in  the same container group during
                        its startup and shutdown sequences. A container  might
                        have dependencies on multiple containers.

                        (structure)
                            A  container's  dependency on another container in
                            the same container group. The  dependency  impacts
                            how  the  dependent  container is able to start or
                            shut down based the status of the other container.

                            For example, ContainerA  is  configured  with  the
                            following  dependency:  a START dependency on Con-
                            tainerB . This means that ContainerA  can't  start
                            until  ContainerB  has started. It also means that
                            ContainerA must shut down before ContainerB .

                               tion that this container depends on.

                            Condition -> (string)
                               The condition  that  the  dependency  container
                               must  reach  before the dependent container can
                               start. Valid conditions include:

                               o START - The dependency  container  must  have
                                 started.

                               o COMPLETE  -  The dependency container has run
                                 to completion  (exits).  Use  this  condition
                                 with  nonessential  containers, such as those
                                 that run a script and then exit.  The  depen-
                                 dency  container  can't  be an essential con-
                                 tainer.

                               o SUCCESS - The dependency container has run to
                                 completion and exited with a zero status. The
                                 dependency container can't  be  an  essential
                                 container.

                               o HEALTHY - The dependency container has passed
                                 its Docker health check. Use  this  condition
                                 with  dependency  containers that have health
                                 checks configured.  This  condition  is  con-
                                 firmed at container group startup only.

                     MountPoints -> (list)
                        A  mount  point that binds a path inside the container
                        to a file or directory on the host system and lets  it
                        access the file or directory.

                        (structure)
                            A  mount point that binds a container to a file or
                            directory on the host system.

                            ContainerPath -> (string)
                               The  mount path on the container. If this prop-
                               erty isn't set, the instance path is used.

                            AccessLevel -> (string)
                               The type of access for the container.

                     EnvironmentOverride -> (list)
                        A set of environment variables that's  passed  to  the
                        container        on       startup.       See       the

                        (structure)
                            An environment variable to set inside a container,
                            in the form of a key-value pair.

                               The environment variable value.

                     Essential -> (boolean)
                        Indicates  whether  the container is vital to the con-
                        tainer group. If an essential container fails, the en-
                        tire container group restarts.

                     HealthCheck -> (structure)
                        A  configuration  for  a  non-terminal health check. A
                        support container automatically restarts if  it  stops
                        functioning or if it fails this health check.

                        Command -> (list)
                            A string array that specifies the command that the
                            container runs to determine if it's healthy.

                            (string)

                        Interval -> (integer)
                            The time period (in seconds) between  each  health
                            check.

                        Retries -> (integer)
                            The number of times to retry a failed health check
                            before flagging the container unhealthy. The first
                            run of the command does not count as a retry.

                        StartPeriod -> (integer)
                            The  optional  grace period (in seconds) to give a
                            container  time  to  bootstrap  before  the  first
                            failed  health  check  counts toward the number of

                        Timeout -> (integer)
                            The time period (in seconds) to wait for a  health
                            check  to  succeed before counting a failed health
                            check.

                     ImageUri -> (string)
                        The URI to the image that Amazon GameLift deploys to a
                        container  fleet.  For a more specific identifier, see

                     MemoryHardLimitMebibytes -> (integer)
                        The amount of memory that Amazon GameLift makes avail-
                        able to the container. If memory limits aren't set for
                        an individual container, the container shares the con-
                        tainer group's total memory allocation.

                     PortConfiguration -> (structure)
                        A set of ports that allow access to the container from
                        external users. Processes running in the container can
                        bind to a one of these ports. Container  ports  aren't
                        directly  accessed by inbound traffic. Amazon GameLift
                        maps these container ports  to  externally  accessible
                        connection  ports,  which  are assigned as needed from
                        the container fleet's ConnectionPortRange .

                        ContainerPortRanges -> (list)
                            A set of one or more container port number ranges.
                            The ranges can't overlap.

                            (structure)
                               A  set  of one or more port numbers that can be
                               opened on the container.

                                   port numbers.

                               ToPort -> (integer)
                                   An  ending  value  for the range of allowed
                                   port numbers. Port numbers  are  end-inclu-
                                   sive.  This  value  must  be  equal  to  or
                                   greater than FromPort .

                               Protocol -> (string)

                     ResolvedImageDigest -> (string)
                        A  unique  and  immutable identifier for the container
                        image. The digest is a SHA 256 hash of  the  container

                 An optional description that was  provided  for  a  container
                 group  definition  update. Each version can have a unique de-
                 scription.

              Status -> (string)
                 Current status of the container  group  definition  resource.
                 Values include:

                 o COPYING  --  Amazon  GameLift  is  in the process of making
                   copies of all container images  that  are  defined  in  the
                   group.  While  in this state, the resource can't be used to
                   create a container fleet.

                 o READY -- Amazon GameLift has copied the registry images for
                   all containers that are defined in the group. You can use a
                   container group definition in this status to create a  con-
                   tainer fleet.

                 o FAILED  --  Amazon  GameLift  failed to create a valid con-
                   tainer group definition resource. For more details  on  the
                   cause  of the failure, see StatusReason . A container group
                   definition resource in failed status will be deleted within
                   a few minutes.

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 Additional  information  about  a  container group definition
                 that's in FAILED status. Possible reasons include:

                 o An internal issue prevented Amazon GameLift  from  creating
                   the  container group definition resource. Delete the failed
                   resource and call  CreateContainerGroupDefinition again.

                 o An access-denied message means that you don't have  permis-
                   sions to access the container image on ECR. See IAM permis-
                   sion examples for help setting up required IAM  permissions
                   for Amazon GameLift.

                 o The  ImageUri  value  for at least one of the containers in
                   the container group definition was invalid or not found  in
                   the current Amazon Web Services account.

                 o At least one of the container images referenced in the con-
                   tainer group definition exceeds the allowed size. For  size
                   limits, see Amazon GameLift endpoints and quotas .

                 o At least one of the container images referenced in the con-
                   tainer group definition uses a different  operating  system
                   than the one defined for the container group.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
