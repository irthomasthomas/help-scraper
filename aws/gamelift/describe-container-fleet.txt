DESCRIBE-CONTAINER-FLEET()                          DESCRIBE-CONTAINER-FLEET()



NAME
       describe-container-fleet -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  properties  for  a container fleet. When requesting at-
       tributes for multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters to retrieve
       results as a set of sequential pages.
          Request options

       o Get container fleet properties for a single fleet. Provide either the
         fleet ID or ARN value.
          Results

       If successful, a ContainerFleet object is  returned.  This  object  in-
       cludes  the  fleet properties, including information about the most re-
       cent deployment.

       NOTE:
          Some API operations limit the number of fleet IDs  that  allowed  in
          one  request. If a request exceeds this limit, the request fails and
          the error message contains the maximum allowed number.

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the container fleet to retrieve. You can use
          either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is  assigned  to  a  Amazon
              GameLift  fleet  resource  and  uniquely identifies it. ARNs are
              unique  across  all  Regions.  Format  is  arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
              gion>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912  .  In a
              GameLift fleet ARN, the resource ID matches the FleetId value.

          FleetRoleArn -> (string)
              The unique identifier for  an  Identity  and  Access  Management
              (IAM)  role with permissions to run your containers on resources
              that are managed by Amazon GameLift. See Set up an  IAM  service
              role . This fleet property can't be changed.

          GameServerContainerGroupDefinitionName -> (string)
              The  name of the fleet's game server container group definition,
              which describes how to deploy containers with your  game  server
              build and support software onto each fleet instance.

          GameServerContainerGroupDefinitionArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to the fleet's
              game server container group. The ARN value also  identifies  the
              specific container group definition version in use.

          PerInstanceContainerGroupDefinitionName -> (string)
              The name of the fleet's per-instance container group definition.

          PerInstanceContainerGroupDefinitionArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to the fleet's
              per-instance container group. The ARN value also identifies  the
              specific container group definition version in use.

          InstanceConnectionPortRange -> (structure)
              The  set of port numbers to open on each instance in a container
              fleet. Connection ports are used by inbound traffic  to  connect
              with processes that are running in containers on the fleet.

              FromPort -> (integer)
                 Starting value for the port range.

              ToPort -> (integer)
                 Ending  value  for  the port. Port numbers are end-inclusive.
                 This value must be equal to or greater than FromPort .

          InstanceInboundPermissions -> (list)
              The IP address ranges and port settings that allow inbound traf-
              fic  to access game server processes and other processes on this
              fleet.

              (structure)
                 A range of IP addresses and port settings that allow  inbound
                 traffic  to  connect  to processes on an instance in a fleet.
                 Processes are assigned an IP address/port number combination,
                 which  must fall into the fleet's allowed ranges. For managed
                 container fleets, the port settings must use  the  same  port
                 numbers as the fleet's connection ports.

                 For  Realtime  Servers  fleets, Amazon GameLift automatically
                 opens two port ranges, one for TCP messaging and one for UDP.

                 FromPort -> (integer)
                     A starting value for a range of allowed port numbers.

                     For  fleets  using  Linux  builds,  only  ports  22   and
                     1026-60000 are valid.

                     For  fleets  using  Windows builds, only ports 1026-60000
                     are valid.

                 ToPort -> (integer)
                     An ending value for a range of allowed port numbers. Port
                     numbers are end-inclusive. This value must be equal to or
                     greater than FromPort .

                     For  fleets  using  Linux  builds,  only  ports  22   and
                     1026-60000 are valid.

                     For  fleets  using  Windows builds, only ports 1026-60000
                     are valid.

                 IpRange -> (string)
                     A range of allowed IP addresses. This value must  be  ex-
                     pressed in CIDR notation. Example: "000.000.000.000/[sub-
                     net  mask]  "  or  optionally   the   shortened   version
                     "0.0.0.0/[subnet mask] ".

                 Protocol -> (string)
                     The network communication protocol used by the fleet.

          GameServerContainerGroupsPerInstance -> (integer)
              The number of times to replicate the game server container group
              on each fleet instance.

          MaximumGameServerContainerGroupsPerInstance -> (integer)
              The calculated maximum number of  game  server  container  group
              that can be deployed on each fleet instance. The calculation de-
              pends on the resource needs of the container group and  the  CPU
              and memory resources of the fleet's instance type.

          InstanceType -> (string)
              The  Amazon  EC2  instance  type to use for all instances in the
              fleet. Instance type determines the computing resources and pro-
              cessing  power  that's available to host your game servers. This
              includes including CPU, memory, storage, and  networking  capac-
              ity. You can't update this fleet property.

          BillingType -> (string)
              Indicates whether the fleet uses On-Demand or Spot instances for
              this fleet. Learn more about when to use On-Demand  versus  Spot
              Instances . You can't update this fleet property.

              By default, this property is set to ON_DEMAND .

          Description -> (string)
              A meaningful description of the container fleet.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A  time stamp indicating when this data object was created. For-
              mat is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for  ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          MetricGroups -> (list)
              The  name  of  an Amazon Web Services CloudWatch metric group to
              add this fleet to. Metric groups aggregate metrics for  multiple
              fleets.

              (string)

          NewGameSessionProtectionPolicy -> (string)
              Determines  whether  Amazon GameLift can shut down game sessions
              on the fleet that are actively running and hosting players. Ama-
              zon GameLift might prompt an instance shutdown when scaling down
              fleet capacity or when retiring  unhealthy  instances.  You  can
              also  set  game  session protection for individual game sessions
              using UpdateGameSession .

              o NoProtection -- Game sessions can be shut down  during  active
                gameplay.

              o FullProtection -- Game sessions in ACTIVE status can't be shut
                down.

          GameSessionCreationLimitPolicy -> (structure)
              A policy that limits the number of game sessions that each indi-
              vidual  player  can create on instances in this fleet. The limit
              applies for a specified span of time.

              NewGameSessionsPerCreator -> (integer)
                 A policy that puts limits on the number of game sessions that
                 a  player  can  create  within a specified span of time. With
                 this policy, you can  control  players'  ability  to  consume
                 available resources.

                 The policy evaluates when a player tries to create a new game
                 session. On receiving  a  CreateGameSession  request,  Amazon
                 GameLift  checks  that  the player (identified by CreatorId )
                 has created fewer than game session limit  in  the  specified
                 time period.

              PolicyPeriodInMinutes -> (integer)
                 The  time span used in evaluating the resource creation limit
                 policy.
