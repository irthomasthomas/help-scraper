       list-game-servers  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: GameServers

OPTIONS
       --game-server-group-name (string)
          An identifier for the game server group to retrieve a list  of  game
          servers from. Use either the  GameServerGroup name or ARN value.

       --sort-order (string)
          Indicates  how to sort the returned data based on game server regis-
          tration timestamp. Use ASCENDING to  retrieve  oldest  game  servers
          first,  or  use DESCENDING to retrieve newest game servers first. If
          this parameter is left empty, game servers are returned in  no  par-
          ticular order.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GameServers -> (list)
          A collection of game server objects that match the request.

          (structure)
                 This  data  type  is  used with the GameLift FleetIQ and game
                 server groups.

              Properties describing a game server that is running  on  an  in-
              stance in a  GameServerGroup .

              A  game  server is created by a successful call to RegisterGame-
              Server and deleted by  calling  DeregisterGameServer  .  A  game
              server  is  claimed to host a game session by calling ClaimGame-
              Server .

              GameServerGroupName -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the game server group where the  game
                 server  is  running.  Use either the  GameServerGroup name or
                 ARN value.

              GameServerGroupArn -> (string)
                 The ARN identifier for the game server group where  the  game
                 server is located.

              GameServerId -> (string)
                 A  custom  string  that  uniquely identifies the game server.
                 Game server IDs are developer-defined and are  unique  across
                 all game server groups in an Amazon Web Services account.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The  unique identifier for the instance where the game server
                 is running. This ID is available in  the  instance  metadata.
                 EC2  instance  IDs  use  a  17-character format, for example:
                 i-1234567890abcdef0 .

              ConnectionInfo -> (string)
                 The port and IP address that must  be  used  to  establish  a
                 client connection to the game server.

              GameServerData -> (string)
                 A set of custom game server properties, formatted as a single
                 string value. This data is passed to a game client or service
                 when it requests information on game servers using  ListGame-
                 Servers or  ClaimGameServer .

              ClaimStatus -> (string)
                 Indicates when an available game server has been reserved for
                 gameplay  but  has not yet started hosting a game. Once it is
                 claimed, the game server remains in CLAIMED status for a max-
                 imum of one minute. During this time, game clients connect to
                 the game server to start the game and trigger the game server
                 to  update its utilization status. After one minute, the game
                 server claim status reverts to null.

              UtilizationStatus -> (string)
                 Indicates whether the game server is currently available  for
                 new games or is busy. Possible statuses include:

                 o AVAILABLE  -  The game server is available to be claimed. A
                   game server that has been claimed remains  in  this  status
                   until it reports game hosting activity.

                 o UTILIZED - The game server is currently hosting a game ses-
                   sion with players.

              RegistrationTime -> (timestamp)
                 Timestamp that indicates when the  game  server  was  created
                 with  a   RegisterGameServer  request. The format is a number
                 expressed  in  Unix  time  as   milliseconds   (for   example
                 "1469498468.057" ).

              LastClaimTime -> (timestamp)
                 Timestamp  that  indicates  the last time the game server was
                 claimed with a  ClaimGameServer request. The format is a num-
                 ber  expressed  in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds (for example
                 "1469498468.057" ). This value is used to  calculate  when  a
                 claimed game server's status should revert to null.

              LastHealthCheckTime -> (timestamp)
                 Timestamp  that  indicates  the last time the game server was
                 updated with health status  using  an   UpdateGameServer  re-
                 quest.  The format is a number expressed in Unix time as mil-
                 liseconds (for example "1469498468.057" ). After game  server
                 registration,  this  property  is  only  changed  when a game
                 server update specifies a health check value.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where to resume  retrieving  results  on  the
          next  call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results
          represent the end of the list.
