DESCRIBE-FLEET-LOCATION-CAPACITY()          DESCRIBE-FLEET-LOCATION-CAPACITY()



NAME
       describe-fleet-location-capacity -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the resource capacity settings for a fleet location. The data
       returned includes the current capacity (number of  EC2  instances)  and
       some scaling settings for the requested fleet location. For a container
       fleet, this operation also returns counts for replica container groups.

       Use this operation to retrieve capacity information for a  fleet's  re-
       mote  location or home Region (you can also retrieve home Region capac-
       ity by calling DescribeFleetCapacity ).

       To retrieve capacity data, identify a fleet and location.

       If successful, a FleetCapacity object is  returned  for  the  requested
       fleet location.

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique identifier for the fleet to request location capacity for.
          You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --location (string)
          The fleet location to retrieve capacity information for.  Specify  a
          location  in the form of an Amazon Web Services Region code, such as
          us-west-2 .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       FleetCapacity -> (structure)
          Resource  capacity information for the requested fleet location. Ca-
          pacity objects are returned only for fleets and locations that  cur-
          rently  exist.  Changes  in  desired instance value can take up to 1
          minute to be reflected.

          FleetId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the fleet associated with the location.

          FleetArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is  assigned  to  a  Amazon
              GameLift  fleet  resource  and  uniquely identifies it. ARNs are
              unique  across  all  Regions.  Format  is  arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
              gion>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .

          InstanceType -> (string)
              The  Amazon  EC2  instance  type that is used for instances in a
              fleet. Instance type determines the computing resources in  use,
              including  CPU,  memory,  storage,  and networking capacity. See
              Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Instance  Types  for  detailed  de-
              scriptions.

          InstanceCounts -> (structure)
              The current number of instances in the fleet, listed by instance
              status. Counts for pending and terminating  instances  might  be
              non-zero  if the fleet is adjusting to a scaling event or if ac-
              cess to resources is temporarily affected.

              DESIRED -> (integer)
                 Requested number of active instances. Amazon  GameLift  takes
                 action as needed to maintain the desired number of instances.
                 Capacity is scaled up or down by  changing  the  desired  in-
                 stances.  A change in the desired instances value can take up
                 to 1 minute to be reflected when viewing a  fleet's  capacity
                 settings.

              MINIMUM -> (integer)
                 The minimum instance count value allowed.

              MAXIMUM -> (integer)
                 The maximum instance count value allowed.

              PENDING -> (integer)
                 Number of instances that are starting but not yet active.

              ACTIVE -> (integer)
                 Actual  number  of instances that are ready to host game ses-
                 sions.

              IDLE -> (integer)
                 Number of active instances that are not currently  hosting  a
                 game session.

              TERMINATING -> (integer)
                 Number of instances that are no longer active but haven't yet
                 been terminated.

          Location -> (string)
              The fleet location for the instance count information, expressed
              as an Amazon Web Services Region code, such as us-west-2 .

          ReplicaContainerGroupCounts -> (structure)
                 This  property  is  used  with the Amazon GameLift containers
                 feature, which is currently in public preview. The number and
                 status of replica container groups in a container fleet.

              PENDING -> (integer)
                 The  number of container groups that are starting up but have
                 not yet registered.

              ACTIVE -> (integer)
                 The number of container groups that  have  active  game  ses-
                 sions.

              IDLE -> (integer)
                 The  number of container groups that have no active game ses-
                 sions.

              TERMINATING -> (integer)
                 The number of container groups that are  in  the  process  of
