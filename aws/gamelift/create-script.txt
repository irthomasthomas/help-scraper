CREATE-SCRIPT()                                                CREATE-SCRIPT()



NAME
       create-script -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new script record for your Realtime Servers script. Realtime
       scripts are JavaScript that provide configuration settings and optional
       custom game logic for your game. The script is deployed when you create
       a Realtime Servers fleet to host your game sessions.  Script  logic  is
       executed during an active game session.

       To  create  a  new script record, specify a script name and provide the
       script file(s). The script files and all dependencies  must  be  zipped
       into  a single file. You can pull the zip file from either of these lo-
       cations:

       o A locally available directory. Use the ZipFile parameter for this op-
         tion.

       o An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket under your Amazon
         Web Services account. Use the StorageLocation parameter for this  op-
         tion.  You'll  need  to have an Identity Access Management (IAM) role
         that allows the Amazon GameLift service to access your S3 bucket.

       If the call is successful, a new script record is created with a unique
       script  ID. If the script file is provided as a local file, the file is
       uploaded to an Amazon GameLift-owned S3 bucket and the script  record's
       storage location reflects this location. If the script file is provided
       as an S3 bucket, Amazon GameLift accesses the file at this storage  lo-
       cation as needed for deployment.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A  descriptive  label that is associated with a script. Script names
          don't need to be unique. You can use  UpdateScript  to  change  this
          value later.

       --storage-location (structure)
          The  location of the Amazon S3 bucket where a zipped file containing
          your Realtime scripts is stored. The storage location  must  specify
          the Amazon S3 bucket name, the zip file name (the "key"), and a role
          ARN that allows Amazon GameLift to access the Amazon S3 storage  lo-
          cation.  The  S3 bucket must be in the same Region where you want to
          create a new script. By default, Amazon GameLift uploads the  latest
          version of the zip file; if you have S3 object versioning turned on,
          you can use the ObjectVersion parameter to specify an  earlier  ver-
          sion.

          Bucket -> (string)
              An Amazon S3 bucket identifier. Thename of the S3 bucket.

              NOTE:
                 Amazon  GameLift  doesn't  support  uploading  from Amazon S3
                 buckets with names that contain a dot (.).

          Key -> (string)
              The name of the zip file that contains the build files or script
              files.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role that allows Ama-
              zon GameLift to access the S3 bucket.

          ObjectVersion -> (string)
              The version of the file, if object versioning is turned  on  for
              the  bucket. Amazon GameLift uses this information when retriev-
              ing files from an S3 bucket that you own. Use this parameter  to
              specify  a  specific version of the file. If not set, the latest
              version of the file is retrieved.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Bucket=string,Key=string,RoleArn=string,ObjectVersion=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Bucket": "string",
            "Key": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string",
            "ObjectVersion": "string"
          }

       --zip-file (blob)
          A data object containing your Realtime scripts and dependencies as a
          zip  file. The zip file can have one or multiple files. Maximum size
          of a zip file is 5 MB.

          When using the Amazon Web Services CLI tool to create a script, this
          parameter is set to the zip file name. It must be prepended with the
          string "fileb://" to indicate that the file data is a binary object.
          For example: --zip-file fileb://myRealtimeScript.zip .

       --tags (list)
          A  list of labels to assign to the new script resource. Tags are de-
          veloper-defined key-value pairs. Tagging  Amazon  Web  Services  re-
          sources  are  useful  for resource management, access management and
          cost allocation. For more information, see Tagging Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices  Resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference . Once
          the resource is created, you can use TagResource ,  UntagResource  ,
          and  ListTagsForResource  to add, remove, and view tags. The maximum
          tag limit may be lower than stated. See the Amazon Web Services Gen-
          eral Reference for actual tagging limits.

          (structure)
              A label that you can assign to a Amazon GameLift resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for a developer-defined key value pair for tagging an
                 Amazon Web Services resource.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value for a developer-defined key value pair for tagging
                 an Amazon Web Services resource.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",

            ...
          ]

       --script-version (string)
          Version information associated  with  a  build  or  script.  Version
          strings  don't need to be unique. You can use UpdateScript to change
          this value later.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Script -> (structure)
          The newly created script record with a unique script ID and ARN. The
          new script's storage location reflects an Amazon S3 location: (1) If
          the  script  was  uploaded from an S3 bucket under your account, the
          storage location reflects the information that was provided  in  the
          CreateScript request; (2) If the script file was uploaded from a lo-
          cal zip file, the storage location reflects an S3 location  controls
          by the Amazon GameLift service.

          ScriptId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the Realtime script

          ScriptArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN ) that is assigned to a Amazon
              GameLift script resource and uniquely identifies  it.  ARNs  are
              unique  across  all  Regions.  In a GameLift script ARN, the re-
              source ID matches the ScriptId value.

          Name -> (string)
              A descriptive label that is associated  with  a  script.  Script
              names don't need to be unique.

          Version -> (string)
              Version  information  associated with a build or script. Version
              strings don't need to be unique.

          SizeOnDisk -> (long)
              The file size of the  uploaded  Realtime  script,  expressed  in
              bytes.  When  files are uploaded from an S3 location, this value
              remains at "0".

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A time stamp indicating when this data object was created.  For-
              mat  is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          StorageLocation -> (structure)
              The location of the Amazon S3 bucket where a  zipped  file  con-
              taining  your  Realtime  scripts is stored. The storage location
              must specify the Amazon S3 bucket name, the zip file  name  (the
              "key"), and a role ARN that allows Amazon GameLift to access the
              Amazon S3 storage location. The S3 bucket must be  in  the  same
              Region where you want to create a new script. By default, Amazon
              GameLift uploads the latest version of the zip file; if you have
              S3  object  versioning  turned on, you can use the ObjectVersion
              parameter to specify an earlier version.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 An Amazon S3 bucket identifier. Thename of the S3 bucket.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon GameLift doesn't support uploading from Amazon  S3
                     buckets with names that contain a dot (.).

              Key -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  zip file that contains the build files or
                 script files.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role  that  allows
                 Amazon GameLift to access the S3 bucket.

              ObjectVersion -> (string)
                 The  version  of  the file, if object versioning is turned on
                 for the bucket. Amazon GameLift uses  this  information  when
                 retrieving files from an S3 bucket that you own. Use this pa-
                 rameter to specify a specific version of  the  file.  If  not
                 set, the latest version of the file is retrieved.
