NAME
       describe-fleet-location-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information on a fleet's remote locations, including life-cy-
       cle status and any suspended fleet activity.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To get data for specific locations, provide a fleet identifier and  a
         list  of locations. Location data is returned in the order that it is
         requested.

       o To get data for all locations, provide a fleet identifier only. Loca-
         tion data is returned in no particular order.

       When  requesting  attributes for multiple locations, use the pagination
       parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

       If successful, a LocationAttributes object is  returned  for  each  re-
       quested  location.  If the fleet does not have a requested location, no
       information is returned. This operation does not return  the  home  Re-
       gion.  To  get information on a fleet's home Region, call DescribeFlee-
       tAttributes .

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to retrieve remote locations  for.
          You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --locations (list)
          A list of fleet locations to retrieve information for. Specify loca-
          tions in the form of an Amazon Web Services  Region  code,  such  as
          us-west-2 .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --limit (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  results to return. Use this parameter with
          NextToken to get results as a set of sequential pages. This limit is
          not currently enforced.

       --next-token (string)
          A  token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of re-
          sults. Use the token that is returned with a previous call  to  this
          operation. To start at the beginning of the result set, do not spec-
          ify a value.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
