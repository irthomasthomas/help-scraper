CREATE-GAME-SESSION()                                    CREATE-GAME-SESSION()



NAME
       create-game-session -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a multiplayer game session for players in a specific fleet lo-
       cation. This operation prompts an available server process to  start  a
       game session and retrieves connection information for the new game ses-
       sion. As an alternative, consider using the Amazon GameLift  game  ses-
       sion  placement feature with StartGameSessionPlacement , which uses the
       FleetIQ algorithm and queues to optimize the placement process.

       When creating a game session, you specify exactly  where  you  want  to
       place  it and provide a set of game session configuration settings. The
       target fleet must be in ACTIVE status.

       You can use this operation in the following ways:

       o To create a game session on an instance in  a  fleet's  home  Region,
         provide  a  fleet or alias ID along with your game session configura-
         tion.

       o To create a game session on an instance in a fleet's remote location,
         provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name, along with your game
         session configuration.

       o To create a game session on an instance in an Anywhere fleet, specify
         the fleet's custom location.

       If successful, Amazon GameLift initiates a workflow to start a new game
       session and returns a GameSession object containing  the  game  session
       configuration  and  status. When the game session status is ACTIVE , it
       is updated with connection information and you can create  player  ses-
       sions for the game session. By default, newly created game sessions are
       open to new players. You  can  restrict  new  player  access  by  using
       UpdateGameSession  to change the game session's player session creation
       policy.

       Amazon GameLift retains logs for active for  14  days.  To  access  the
       logs, call GetGameSessionLogUrl to download the log files.
          Available in Amazon GameLift Local.

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the fleet to create a game session in. You
          can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. Each request  must  refer-
          ence either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.

       --alias-id (string)
          A  unique identifier for the alias associated with the fleet to cre-
          ate a game session in. You can use either the alias ID or ARN value.
          Each  request  must reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not
          both.

       --maximum-player-session-count (integer)
          The maximum number of players that can be  connected  simultaneously
          to the game session.

       --name (string)
          A  descriptive label that is associated with a game session. Session
          names do not need to be unique.

       --game-properties (list)
          A set of key-value pairs that can store custom data in a  game  ses-
          sion. For example: {"Key": "difficulty", "Value": "novice"} . For an
          example, see Create a game session with custom properties .

          (structure)
              This key-value pair can store custom data about a game  session.
              For  example,  you might use a GameProperty to track a game ses-
              sion's map, level of difficulty, or remaining time.  The  diffi-
              culty  level could be specified like this: {"Key": "difficulty",
              "Value":"Novice"} .

              You can set game properties when creating a  game  session.  You
              can  also modify game properties of an active game session. When
              searching for game sessions, you can  filter  on  game  property
              keys  and  values.  You can't delete game properties from a game
              session.

              For examples of working with game properties, see Create a  game
              session with properties .

              Key -> (string)
                 The game property identifier.

              Value -> (string)
                 The game property value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --creator-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for a player or entity creating the game ses-
          sion.

          If you add a resource creation limit policy to  a  fleet,  the  Cre-
          ateGameSession operation requires a CreatorId . Amazon GameLift lim-
          its the number of game session creation requests with the same  Cre-
          atorId in a specified time period.

          If  you your fleet doesn't have a resource creation limit policy and
          you provide a CreatorId in your CreateGameSession  requests,  Amazon
          GameLift limits requests to one request per CreatorId per second.

          To  not  limit  CreateGameSession requests with the same CreatorId ,
          don't provide a CreatorId in your CreateGameSession request.

       --game-session-id (string)
              This parameter is deprecated. Use ``IdempotencyToken`` instead.

          Custom string that uniquely identifies a request for a new game ses-
          sion.  Maximum  token  length  is  48  characters. If provided, this
          string is included in the new game session's ID.

       --idempotency-token (string)
          Custom string that uniquely identifies the new game session request.
          This is useful for ensuring that game session requests with the same
          idempotency token are processed only once. Subsequent requests  with
          the  same string return the original GameSession object, with an up-
          dated status. Maximum token length is 48  characters.  If  provided,
          this string is included in the new game session's ID. A game session
          ARN has the  following  format:  arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gameses-
          sion/<fleet  ID>/<custom  ID  string or idempotency token> . Idempo-
          tency tokens remain in use for 30 days  after  a  game  session  has
          ended;  game  session  objects are retained for this time period and
          then deleted.

       --game-session-data (string)
          A set of custom game  session  properties,  formatted  as  a  single
          string  value.  This  data is passed to a game server process with a
          request to start a new game session. For more information, see Start
          a game session .

       --location (string)
          A  fleet's remote location to place the new game session in. If this
          parameter is not set, the new game session is placed in the  fleet's
          home  Region.  Specify a remote location with an Amazon Web Services
          Region code such as us-west-2 . When using an Anywhere  fleet,  this
          parameter is required and must be set to the Anywhere fleet's custom
          location.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GameSession -> (structure)
          Object that describes the newly created game session record.

          GameSessionId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the game session. A game session ARN has
              the    following   format:   arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gameses-
              sion/<fleet ID>/<custom ID string or idempotency token> .

          Name -> (string)
              A descriptive label that is associated with a game session. Ses-
              sion names do not need to be unique.

          FleetId -> (string)
              A  unique identifier for the fleet that the game session is run-
              ning on.

          FleetArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN )  associated  with  the  GameLift
              fleet that this game session is running on.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A  time stamp indicating when this data object was created. For-
              mat is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for  ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          TerminationTime -> (timestamp)
              A  time  stamp  indicating when this data object was terminated.
              Format is a number expressed in Unix time as  milliseconds  (for
              example "1469498468.057" ).

          CurrentPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)
              Number of players currently in the game session.

          MaximumPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)
              The  maximum  number of players that can be connected simultane-
              ously to the game session.

          Status -> (string)
              Current status of the game session. A game session must have  an
              ACTIVE status to have player sessions.

          StatusReason -> (string)
              Provides  additional  information about game session status. IN-
              TERRUPTED indicates that the game session was hosted on  a  spot
              instance  that was reclaimed, causing the active game session to
              be terminated.

          GameProperties -> (list)
              A set of key-value pairs that can store custom data  in  a  game
              session. For example: {"Key": "difficulty", "Value": "novice"} .

              (structure)
                 This  key-value  pair can store custom data about a game ses-
                 sion. For example, you might use a GameProperty  to  track  a
                 game  session's  map, level of difficulty, or remaining time.
                 The difficulty level could be specified  like  this:  {"Key":
                 "difficulty", "Value":"Novice"} .

                 You can set game properties when creating a game session. You
                 can also modify game properties of an  active  game  session.
                 When  searching  for  game  sessions,  you can filter on game
                 property keys and values. You can't  delete  game  properties
                 from a game session.

                 For  examples  of  working with game properties, see Create a
                 game session with properties .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The game property identifier.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The game property value.

          IpAddress -> (string)
              The IP address of the game  session.  To  connect  to  a  Amazon
              GameLift  game server, an app needs both the IP address and port
              number.

          DnsName -> (string)
              The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is running  the
              game session. Values have the following format:

              o TLS-enabled   fleets:   <unique   identifier>.<region  identi-
                fier>.amazongamelift.com .

              o Non-TLS-enabled fleets:  ec2-<unique  identifier>.compute.ama-
                zonaws.com . (See Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing .)

              When  connecting  to a game session that is running on a TLS-en-
              abled fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP address.

          Port -> (integer)
              The port number for the game session. To  connect  to  a  Amazon
              GameLift  game server, an app needs both the IP address and port
              number.

          PlayerSessionCreationPolicy -> (string)
              Indicates whether or not the game session is accepting new play-
              ers.

          CreatorId -> (string)
              A  unique  identifier for a player. This ID is used to enforce a
              resource protection policy (if one exists), that limits the num-
              ber of game sessions a player can create.

          GameSessionData -> (string)
              A  set  of custom game session properties, formatted as a single
              string value. This data is passed to a game server process  with
              a request to start a new game session. For more information, see
              Start a game session .

          MatchmakerData -> (string)
              Information about the matchmaking process that resulted  in  the
              game  session,  if matchmaking was used. Data is in JSON syntax,
              formatted as a string. Information includes the matchmaker ID as
              well as player attributes and team assignments. For more details
              on matchmaker data, see Match Data . Matchmaker data is  updated
              whenever new players are added during a successful backfill (see
              StartMatchBackfill ).

          Location -> (string)
              The fleet location where the game session is running. This value
              might  specify the fleet's home Region or a remote location. Lo-
              cation is expressed as an Amazon Web Services Region  code  such
              as us-west-2 .
