SYNOPSIS
            describe-build
          --build-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --build-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for the build to retrieve properties for. You
          can use either the build ID or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information on a custom game build

       The  following  describe-build  example retrieves properties for a game
       server build resource.

          aws gamelift describe-build \
              --build-id build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "Build": {
                  "BuildArn": "arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::build/build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "BuildId": "build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "CreationTime": 1496708916.18,
                  "Name": "My_Game_Server_Build_One",
                  "OperatingSystem": "AMAZON_LINUX",
                  "SizeOnDisk": 1304924,
                  "Status": "READY",
                  "Version": "12345.678"
              }
          }

       the Amazon GameLift Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Build -> (structure)
          Set of properties describing the requested build.

          BuildId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the build.

          BuildArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN ) assigned to a Amazon GameLift
              build resource and  uniquely  identifies  it.  ARNs  are  unique
              across    all    Regions.    Format   is   arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
              gion>::build/build-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .  In  a
              GameLift build ARN, the resource ID matches the BuildId value.

          Name -> (string)
              A  descriptive  label associated with a build. Build names don't
              need  to  be  unique.  It  can  be  set  using  CreateBuild   or
              UpdateBuild .

          Version -> (string)
              Version  information  associated with a build or script. Version
              strings don't need to be unique.

          Status -> (string)
              Current status of the build.

              Possible build statuses include the following:

              o INITIALIZED -- A new build has been defined, but no files have
                been uploaded. You cannot create fleets for builds that are in
                this status. When a build is successfully created,  the  build
                status is set to this value.

              o READY  --  The  game build has been successfully uploaded. You
                can now create new fleets for this build.

              o FAILED -- The game build upload failed. You cannot create  new
                fleets for this build.

          SizeOnDisk -> (long)
              File  size  of the uploaded game build, expressed in bytes. When
              the build status is INITIALIZED or when using a custom Amazon S3
              storage location, this value is 0.

          OperatingSystem -> (string)
              Operating  system that the game server binaries are built to run
              on. This value determines the type of fleet resources  that  you
              can use for this build.

              NOTE:
                 Amazon  Linux 2 (AL2) will reach end of support on 6/30/2025.
                 See more details in the  Amazon  Linux  2  FAQs  .  For  game
                 servers that are hosted on AL2 and use Amazon GameLift server
                 SDK 4.x., first update the game server build  to  server  SDK
                 5.x, and then deploy to AL2023 instances. See Migrate to Ama-
                 zon GameLift server SDK version 5.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A time stamp indicating when this data object was created.  For-
              mat  is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          ServerSdkVersion -> (string)
              The Amazon GameLift Server SDK version used to develop your game
              server.
