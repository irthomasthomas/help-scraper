NAME
       create-matchmaking-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Defines a new matchmaking configuration for use with FlexMatch. Whether
       your are using FlexMatch with Amazon GameLift hosting or  as  a  stand-
       alone matchmaking service, the matchmaking configuration sets out rules
       for matching players and forming teams. If  you're  also  using  Amazon
       GameLift hosting, it defines how to start game sessions for each match.
       Your matchmaking system can use multiple configurations to handle  dif-
       ferent  game scenarios. All matchmaking requests identify the matchmak-
       ing configuration to use and provide player attributes consistent  with
       that configuration.

       To  create a matchmaking configuration, you must provide the following:
       configuration name and FlexMatch mode (with or without Amazon  GameLift
       hosting);  a  rule  set that specifies how to evaluate players and find
       acceptable matches; whether player acceptance is required; and the max-
       imum  time allowed for a matchmaking attempt. When using FlexMatch with
       Amazon GameLift hosting, you also need to  identify  the  game  session
       queue to use when starting a game session for the match.

       In  addition,  you  must  set  up an Amazon Simple Notification Service
       topic to receive matchmaking notifications. Provide the  topic  ARN  in
       the matchmaking configuration.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A  unique identifier for the matchmaking configuration. This name is
          used to identify the configuration associated with a matchmaking re-
          quest or ticket.

       --description (string)
          A human-readable description of the matchmaking configuration.

       --game-session-queue-arns (list)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN  )  that  is  assigned to a Amazon
          GameLift game session queue resource  and  uniquely  identifies  it.
          ARNs  are unique across all Regions. Format is arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
          gion>::gamesessionqueue/<queue name> . Queues can be located in  any
          Region.  Queues  are  used  to start new Amazon GameLift-hosted game
          sessions for matches that are created with this matchmaking configu-
          ration.  If FlexMatchMode is set to STANDALONE , do not set this pa-
          rameter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --request-timeout-seconds (integer)
          The maximum duration, in seconds, that a matchmaking ticket can  re-
          main  in process before timing out. Requests that fail due to timing
          out can be resubmitted as needed.

       --acceptance-timeout-seconds (integer)
          The length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept a pro-
          posed match, if acceptance is required.

       --acceptance-required | --no-acceptance-required (boolean)
          A  flag  that  determines whether a match that was created with this
          configuration must be accepted by the matched  players.  To  require
          acceptance,  set  to  TRUE  .  With this option enabled, matchmaking
          tickets use the status REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE to indicate when  a  com-
          pleted potential match is waiting for player acceptance.

       --rule-set-name (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for the matchmaking rule set to use with this
          configuration. You can use either the rule set name or ARN value.  A
          matchmaking configuration can only use rule sets that are defined in
          the same Region.

       --notification-target (string)
          An SNS topic ARN that is set up  to  receive  matchmaking  notifica-
          tions.  See Setting up notifications for matchmaking for more infor-

          for a single 10-person team, and the additional player count is  set
          to  2,  10  players will be selected for the match and 2 more player
          slots will be open for future players. This parameter is not used if
          FlexMatchMode is set to STANDALONE .

       --custom-event-data (string)
          Information  to  be  added to all events related to this matchmaking
          configuration.

       --game-properties (list)
          A set  of  custom  properties  for  a  game  session,  formatted  as
          key:value  pairs.  These  properties  are  passed  to  a game server
          process with a request to start a new game session (see Start a Game
          Session  ).  This information is added to the new GameSession object
          that is created for a successful match. This parameter is  not  used
          if FlexMatchMode is set to STANDALONE .

          (structure)
              Set  of  key-value  pairs  that contain information about a game

              session. For example, a game property might specify a game mode,
              level,  or  map.  Game  properties are passed to the game server
              process when initiating a new game session.  For  more  informa-
              tion, see the Amazon GameLift Developer Guide .

              Key -> (string)

          This information is added to the new GameSession object that is cre-
          ated  for  a  successful  match. This parameter is not used if Flex-
          MatchMode is set to STANDALONE .

       --backfill-mode (string)
          The method used to backfill game sessions that are created with this
          matchmaking  configuration.  Specify  MANUAL  when your game manages

                 Set of key-value pairs that contain information about a  game
                 session. When included in a game session request, these prop-
                 erties communicate details to be used when setting up the new
                 game  session.  For  example, a game property might specify a
                 game mode, level, or map. Game properties are passed  to  the
                 game  server  process when initiating a new game session. For

              A set of custom game session properties, formatted as  a  single
              string  value. This data is passed to a game server process with
              a request to start a new game session (see Start a Game  Session
              ).  This information is added to the new GameSession object that
              is created for a successful match. This parameter  is  not  used
              when FlexMatchMode is set to STANDALONE .

          BackfillMode -> (string)
              The  method  used  to  backfill  game sessions created with this
              matchmaking configuration. MANUAL indicates that the game  makes
              backfill  requests  or  does not use the match backfill feature.
              AUTOMATIC indicates  that  GameLift  creates  backfill  requests
              whenever  a  game session has one or more open slots. Learn more
              about manual and automatic backfill in Backfill  existing  games
              with  FlexMatch . Automatic backfill is not available when Flex-
              MatchMode is set to STANDALONE .
