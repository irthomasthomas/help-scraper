CREATE-ALIAS()                                                  CREATE-ALIAS()



NAME
       create-alias -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias
       ID in place of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for
       a  fleet  that is useful when redirecting player traffic from one fleet
       to another, such as when updating your game build.

       Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies  for  aliases:
       simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A termi-
       nal alias is used to display messaging or link  to  a  URL  instead  of
       routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a termi-
       nal alias when a game version is no longer supported and  you  want  to
       direct players to an upgrade site.

       To  create  a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and
       optional description. Each simple alias can point to  only  one  fleet,
       but  a  fleet  can  have  multiple  aliases. If successful, a new alias
       record is returned, including an alias ID and an ARN. You can  reassign
       an alias to another fleet by calling UpdateAlias .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A descriptive label that is associated with an alias. Alias names do
          not need to be unique.

       --description (string)
          A human-readable description of the alias.

       --routing-strategy (structure)
          The routing configuration, including routing type and fleet  target,
          for the alias.

          Type -> (string)
              The type of routing strategy for the alias.

              Possible routing types include the following:

              o SIMPLE  -  The  alias resolves to one specific fleet. Use this
                type when routing to active fleets.

              o TERMINAL - The alias does not resolve to a fleet  but  instead
                can be used to display a message to the user. A terminal alias
                throws a TerminalRoutingStrategyException with the message em-
                bedded.

          FleetId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the fleet that the alias points to. This
              value is the fleet ID, not the fleet ARN.

          Message -> (string)
              The message text to be used with a terminal routing strategy.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,FleetId=string,Message=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Type": "SIMPLE"|"TERMINAL",
            "FleetId": "string",
            "Message": "string"
          }

       --tags (list)
          A list of labels to assign to the new alias resource. Tags  are  de-
          veloper-defined  key-value  pairs.  Tagging  Amazon Web Services re-
          sources are useful for resource management,  access  management  and
          cost  allocation.  For more information, see Tagging Amazon Web Ser-
          vices Resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

          (structure)
              A label that you can assign to a Amazon GameLift resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for a developer-defined key value pair for tagging an
                 Amazon Web Services resource.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for a developer-defined key value pair for  tagging
                 an Amazon Web Services resource.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Alias -> (structure)
          The newly created alias resource.

          AliasId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the alias. Alias IDs are unique within a
              Region.

          Name -> (string)
              A descriptive label that is  associated  with  an  alias.  Alias

          AliasArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN ) that is assigned to a Amazon
              GameLift alias resource and uniquely  identifies  it.  ARNs  are
              unique  across  all  Regions.  Format  is  arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
              gion>::alias/alias-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .  In  a
              GameLift alias ARN, the resource ID matches the alias ID value.

          Description -> (string)
              A human-readable description of an alias.

          RoutingStrategy -> (structure)
              The routing configuration, including routing type and fleet tar-
              get, for the alias.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of routing strategy for the alias.

                 Possible routing types include the following:

                 o SIMPLE - The alias resolves to one specific fleet. Use this
                   type when routing to active fleets.

                 o TERMINAL  -  The  alias does not resolve to a fleet but in-
                   stead can be used to display a message to the user. A  ter-
                   minal  alias throws a TerminalRoutingStrategyException with
                   the message embedded.

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the fleet that the alias  points  to.
                 This value is the fleet ID, not the fleet ARN.

              Message -> (string)
                 The message text to be used with a terminal routing strategy.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A  time stamp indicating when this data object was created. For-
              mat is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for  ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
              The  time  that  this data object was last modified. Format is a
              number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds  (for  example
              "1469498468.057" ).
