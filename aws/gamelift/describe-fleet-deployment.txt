OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique identifier for the container fleet. You can use either the
          fleet ID or ARN value.

       --deployment-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the deployment to return information for.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       FleetDeployment -> (structure)
          The requested deployment information.

          DeploymentId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the deployment.

          FleetId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the container fleet.

          GameServerBinaryArn -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the version of the  game  server  con-
              tainer group definition that is being deployed.

          RollbackGameServerBinaryArn -> (string)
              The  unique  identifier  for the version of the game server con-
              tainer group definition to roll back to if deployment fails.

          PerInstanceBinaryArn -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the version of the  per-instance  con-
              tainer group definition that is being deployed.

          RollbackPerInstanceBinaryArn -> (string)
              The  unique  identifier for the version of the per-instance con-
              tainer group definition to roll back to if deployment fails.

          DeploymentStatus -> (string)
              The status of fleet deployment activity in the location.

              o IN_PROGRESS -- The deployment is in progress.

              o IMPAIRED -- The deployment failed and the fleet has  some  im-
                paired containers.

              o COMPLETE -- The deployment has completed successfully.

              o ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS -- The deployment failed and rollback has
                been initiated.

              o ROLLBACK_IN_COMPLETE -- The deployment failed and rollback has
                been completed.

              o CANCELLED -- The deployment was cancelled.

          DeploymentConfiguration -> (structure)
              Instructions  for how to deploy updates to a container fleet and
              what actions to take if the deployment fails.

              ProtectionStrategy -> (string)
                 Determines how fleet deployment activity affects active  game
                 sessions  on  the fleet. With protection, a deployment honors
                 game session protection, and delays actions that would inter-
                 rupt  a  protected active game session until the game session
                 ends. Without protection, deployment activity can  shut  down
                 all running tasks, including active game sessions, regardless
                 of game session protection.

              MinimumHealthyPercentage -> (integer)
                 Sets a minimum level of healthy tasks to maintain during  de-
                 ployment activity.

              ImpairmentStrategy -> (string)
                 Determines what actions to take if a deployment fails. If the
                 fleet is multi-location, this  strategy  applies  across  all
                 fleet  locations. With a rollback strategy, updated fleet in-
                 stances are rolled back to the  last  successful  deployment.
                 Alternatively, you can maintain a few impaired containers for
                 the purpose of debugging, while all other tasks return to the
                 last successful deployment.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A  time stamp indicating when this data object was created. For-
              mat is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for  ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

       LocationalDeployments -> (map)
          If  the  deployment  is for a multi-location fleet, the requests re-
          turns the deployment status in each fleet location.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              For a multi-location container fleet, describes the progress  of
              a deployment across all fleet locations.

              DeploymentStatus -> (string)
                 The status of fleet deployment activity in the location.

                 o IN_PROGRESS -- The deployment is in progress.

                 o IMPAIRED  --  The  deployment failed and the fleet has some
                   impaired containers.

                 o COMPLETE -- The deployment has completed successfully.

                 o ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS -- The deployment failed and  rollback
                   has been initiated.

                 o ROLLBACK_IN_COMPLETE  -- The deployment failed and rollback
                   has been completed.

                 o CANCELLED -- The deployment was cancelled.
