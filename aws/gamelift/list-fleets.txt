LIST-FLEETS()                                                    LIST-FLEETS()



NAME
       list-fleets -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a collection of fleet resources in an Amazon Web Services Re-
       gion. You can call this operation to get fleets  in  a  previously  se-
       lected                default                Region                (see
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/setting-global-region.html
       or  specify  a Region in your request. You can filter the result set to
       find only those fleets that are  deployed  with  a  specific  build  or
       script.  For  fleets  that  have multiple locations, this operation re-
       trieves fleets based on their home Region only.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To get a list of all fleets in a Region, don't  provide  a  build  or
         script identifier.

       o To get a list of all fleets where a specific custom game build is de-
         ployed, provide the build ID.

       o To get a list of all Realtime Servers fleets with a specific configu-
         ration script, provide the script ID.

       Use  the  pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequen-
       tial pages.

       If successful, a list of fleet IDs that match the request parameters is
       returned.  A  NextToken value is also returned if there are more result
       pages to retrieve.

       NOTE:
              Fleet resources are not listed in a particular order.

       list-fleets  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: FleetIds

OPTIONS
       --build-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the build to request fleets  for.  Use  this
          parameter  to return only fleets using a specified build. Use either
          the build ID or ARN value.

       --script-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the Realtime script to request  fleets  for.
          Use  this  parameter to return only fleets using a specified script.
          Use either the script ID or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example1: To get a list of all fleets in a Region

       The  following list-fleets example displays the fleet IDs of all fleets
       in the current Region. This example uses pagination parameters  to  re-
       trieve  two fleet IDs at a time. The response includes a next-token at-
       tribute, which indicates that there are more results to retrieve.

          aws gamelift list-fleets \
              --limit 2

       Output:

          {
              "FleetIds": [
                  "fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222"
              ],
              "NextToken": "eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC01NWYxZTZmMS1jY2FlLTQ3YTctOWI5ZS1iYjFkYTQwMjJEXAMPLE="
          }

       You can pass the NextToken value from the previous response in the next
       command, as shown here to get the next two results.

          aws gamelift list-fleets \
              --limit 2 \
              --next-token eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC00NDRlZjQxZS1hM2I1LTQ2NDYtODJmMy0zYzI4ZTgxNjVjEXAMPLE=

       Example2: To get a list of all fleets in a Region with a specific build
       or script

       The following list-builds example retrieves the IDs of fleets that  are
       deployed with the specified game build. If you're working with Realtime
       Servers, you can provide a script ID in place of a  build  ID.  Because
       this  example does not specify the limit parameter, the results can in-
       clude up to 16 fleet IDs.

          aws gamelift list-fleets \
              --build-id build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "FleetIds": [
                  "fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",
                  "fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE33333",
                  "fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE44444"
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       FleetIds -> (list)
          A set of fleet IDs that match the list request. You can retrieve ad-
          ditional  information  about all returned fleets by passing this re-
          sult set to a  DescribeFleetAttributes ,  DescribeFleetCapacity , or
          DescribeFleetUtilization call.

          (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
