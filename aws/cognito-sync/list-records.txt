LIST-RECORDS()                                                  LIST-RECORDS()



NAME
       list-records -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  paginated  records,  optionally  changed  after a particular sync
       count for a dataset and identity. With Amazon Cognito Sync, each  iden-
       tity  has  access  only  to its own data. Thus, the credentials used to
       make this API call need to have access to the identity data.

       ListRecords can be called with temporary user credentials  provided  by
       Cognito  Identity or with developer credentials. You should use Cognito
       Identity credentials to make this API call.

OPTIONS
       --identity-pool-id  (string)   A   name-spaced   GUID   (for   example,
       us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE)  created by Amazon Cog-
       nito. GUID generation is unique within a region.

       --identity-id   (string)   A    name-spaced    GUID    (for    example,
       us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE)  created by Amazon Cog-
       nito. GUID generation is unique within a region.

       --dataset-name (string) A string of up to 128 characters. Allowed char-
       acters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '_' (underscore), '-' (dash), and '.' (dot).

       --last-sync-count (long) The last server sync count for this record.

       --next-token (string) A pagination token for obtaining the next page of
       results.

       --max-results (integer) The maximum number of results to be returned.

       --sync-session-token (string) A token containing a session ID, identity
       ID, and expiration.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
