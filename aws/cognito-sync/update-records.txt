UPDATE-RECORDS()                                              UPDATE-RECORDS()



NAME
       update-records -

DESCRIPTION
       Posts updates to records and adds and deletes records for a dataset and
       user.

       The sync count in the record patch is your last known  sync  count  for
       that record. The server will reject an UpdateRecords request with a Re-
       sourceConflictException if you try to patch a record with a  new  value
       but a stale sync count.

       For  example,  if  the  sync  count on the server is 5 for a key called
       highScore and you try and submit a new highScore with sync count of  4,
       the  request  will  be rejected. To obtain the current sync count for a
       record, call ListRecords. On a successful update of the record, the re-
       sponse  returns  the new sync count for that record. You should present
       that sync count the next time you try to update that same record.  When
       the record does not exist, specify the sync count as 0.

       This API can be called with temporary user credentials provided by Cog-
       nito Identity or with developer credentials.

OPTIONS
       --identity-pool-id  (string)   A   name-spaced   GUID   (for   example,
       us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE)  created by Amazon Cog-
       nito. GUID generation is unique within a region.

       --identity-id   (string)   A    name-spaced    GUID    (for    example,
       us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE)  created by Amazon Cog-
       nito. GUID generation is unique within a region.

       --dataset-name (string) A string of up to 128 characters. Allowed char-
       acters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '_' (underscore), '-' (dash), and '.' (dot).

       --device-id (string)
          The unique ID generated for this device by Cognito.

       --record-patches (list) A list of patch operations.(structure)
          An update operation for a record.

          Op -> (string)
              An operation, either replace or remove.

          Key -> (string)
              The key associated with the record patch.

          Value -> (string)
              The value associated with the record patch.

          SyncCount -> (long)
              Last  known  server  sync count for this record. Set to 0 if un-
              known.

          DeviceLastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
              The last modified date of the client device.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Op=string,Key=string,Value=string,SyncCount=long,DeviceLastModifiedDate=timestamp ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Op": "replace"|"remove",
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "SyncCount": long,
              "DeviceLastModifiedDate": timestamp
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sync-session-token (string) The SyncSessionToken returned by a previ-
       ous call to ListRecords for this dataset and identity.

       --client-context (string) Intended to supply a device ID that will pop-
       ulate the lastModifiedBy field referenced in other methods. The Client-
       Context field is not yet implemented.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
