DELETE-DATASET()                                              DELETE-DATASET()



NAME
       delete-dataset -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the specific dataset. The dataset will be deleted permanently,
       and the action can't be undone. Datasets that this dataset  was  merged
       with  will no longer report the merge. Any subsequent operation on this
       dataset will result in a ResourceNotFoundException.

       This API can be called with temporary user credentials provided by Cog-
       nito Identity or with developer credentials.

OPTIONS
       --identity-pool-id   (string)   A   name-spaced   GUID   (for  example,
       us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE) created by Amazon  Cog-
       nito. GUID generation is unique within a region.

       --identity-id    (string)    A    name-spaced    GUID   (for   example,
       us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE) created by Amazon  Cog-
       nito. GUID generation is unique within a region.

       --dataset-name (string) A string of up to 128 characters. Allowed char-
       acters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '_' (underscore), '-' (dash), and '.' (dot).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Dataset -> (structure)
          A collection of data for an identity pool. An identity pool can have
          multiple datasets. A dataset is per identity and can be  general  or
          associated  with a particular entity in an application (like a saved
          game). Datasets are automatically created if they don't exist.  Data
          is  synced by dataset, and a dataset can hold up to 1MB of key-value
          pairs.

          IdentityId -> (string)
              A         name-spaced         GUID         (for         example,
              us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE)  created by Ama-
              zon Cognito. GUID generation is unique within a region.

          DatasetName -> (string)
              A string of up to 128 characters. Allowed  characters  are  a-z,
              A-Z, 0-9, '_' (underscore), '-' (dash), and '.' (dot).

          CreationDate -> (timestamp)
              Date on which the dataset was created.

          LastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
              Date when the dataset was last modified.

          LastModifiedBy -> (string)
              The device that made the last change to this dataset.

          DataStorage -> (long)
              Total size in bytes of the records in this dataset.

          NumRecords -> (long)
              Number of records in this dataset.
