RESOLVE-ROOM()                                                  RESOLVE-ROOM()



NAME
       resolve-room -

DESCRIPTION
       Determines  the details for the room from which a skill request was in-
       voked. This operation is used by skill developers.

       To query ResolveRoom from an Alexa skill, the skill ID needs to be  au-
       thorized.  When the skill is using an AWS Lambda function, the skill is
       automatically authorized when you publish your skill as a private skill
       to  your AWS account. Skills that are hosted using a custom web service
       must be manually authorized. To get your skill authorized, contact  AWS
       Support  with  your AWS account ID that queries the ResolveRoom API and
       skill ID.

OPTIONS
       --user-id (string)
          The ARN of the user. Required.

       --skill-id (string)
          The ARN of the skill that was requested. Required.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)
