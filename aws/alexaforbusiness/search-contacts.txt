OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters to use to list a specified set  of  address  books.  The
          supported  filter keys are DisplayName, FirstName, LastName, and Ad-
          dressBookArns.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific list of results. Filters can be used to match a set of re-
              sources by various criteria.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of a filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The values of a filter.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sort-criteria (list)
          The sort order to use in listing the specified set of contacts.  The
          supported sort keys are DisplayName, FirstName, and LastName.

          (structure)
              An object representing a sort criteria.

              Key -> (string)
                 The sort key of a sort object.

              Value -> (string)
                 The sort value of a sort object.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "ASC"|"DESC"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --next-token (string)
          An  optional token returned from a prior request. Use this token for
          pagination of results from this action. If this parameter is  speci-
          fied, the response only includes results beyond the token, up to the
          value specified by MaxResults.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to include in the  response.  If  more
          results  exist  than  the specified MaxResults value, a token is in-
          cluded in the response so that the  remaining  results  can  be  re-
          trieved.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
