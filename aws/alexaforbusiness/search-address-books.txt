OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters to use to list a specified set  of  address  books.  The
          supported filter key is AddressBookName.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results. Filters can be used to match a set of re-
              sources by various criteria.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of a filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The values of a filter.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sort-criteria (list)
          The sort order to use in listing the specified set of address books.
          The supported sort key is AddressBookName.

          (structure)
              An object representing a sort criteria.

              Key -> (string)
                 The sort key of a sort object.

              Value -> (string)
                 The sort value of a sort object.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "ASC"|"DESC"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --next-token (string)
          An optional token returned from a prior request. Use this token  for
          pagination  of results from this action. If this parameter is speci-
          fied, the response only includes results beyond the token, up to the
          value specified by MaxResults.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of results to include in the response. If more
          results exist than the specified MaxResults value, a  token  is  in-
          cluded  in  the  response  so  that the remaining results can be re-
          trieved.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
