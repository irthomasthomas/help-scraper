GET-RECOMMENDATIONS()                                    GET-RECOMMENDATIONS()



NAME
       get-recommendations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  recommendations for the specified session. To avoid retriev-
       ing   the   same   recommendations    in    subsequent    calls,    use
       NotifyRecommendationsReceived . This API supports long-polling behavior
       with the waitTimeSeconds parameter. Short poll is the default  behavior
       and only returns recommendations already available. To perform a manual
       query against an assistant, use QueryAssistant .

OPTIONS
       --assistant-id (string)
          The identifier of the Wisdom assistant. Can be either the ID or  the
          ARN. URLs cannot contain the ARN.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return per page.

       --session-id (string)
          The identifier of the session. Can be either the ID or the ARN. URLs
          cannot contain the ARN.

       --wait-time-seconds (integer)
          The duration (in seconds) for which the call waits for a recommenda-
          tion  to  be made available before returning. If a recommendation is
          available, the call returns sooner than WaitTimeSeconds . If no mes-
          sages are available and the wait time expires, the call returns suc-
          cessfully with an empty list.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
