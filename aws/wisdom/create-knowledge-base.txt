NAME
       create-knowledge-base -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a knowledge base.

       NOTE:
          When using this API, you cannot reuse Amazon AppIntegrations DataIn-
          tegrations with external knowledge bases such as Salesforce and Ser-
          viceNow. If you do, you'll get an InvalidRequestException error.

          For  example,  you're programmatically managing your external knowl-
          edge base, and you want to add or remove one of the fields  that  is
          being ingested from Salesforce. Do the following:

          o Call DeleteKnowledgeBase .

          o Call DeleteDataIntegration .

          o Call  CreateDataIntegration  to  recreate the DataIntegration or a
            create different one.

          o Call CreateKnowledgeBase.

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request. If not provided, the Amazon Web Services

       --description (string)
          The description.

       --knowledge-base-type (string)
          The type of knowledge base. Only CUSTOM knowledge bases allow you to
          upload your own content. EXTERNAL knowledge bases  support  integra-
          tions  with  third-party systems whose content is synchronized auto-
          matically.

          Possible values:

          o EXTERNAL

          o CUSTOM

          o QUICK_RESPONSES

       --name (string)
          The name of the knowledge base.

       --rendering-configuration (structure)
          Information about how to render the content.

          templateUri -> (string)
              A URI template containing exactly one  variable  in  ${variable-
              Name} format. This can only be set for EXTERNAL knowledge bases.
              For Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Zendesk, the  variable  must  be
              one of the following:

              o Salesforce:  Id , ArticleNumber , VersionNumber , Title , Pub-
                lishStatus , or IsDeleted

       the string will be taken literally.
