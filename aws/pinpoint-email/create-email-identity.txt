CREATE-EMAIL-IDENTITY()                                CREATE-EMAIL-IDENTITY()



NAME
       create-email-identity -

DESCRIPTION
       Verifies an email identity for use with Amazon Pinpoint. In Amazon Pin-
       point, an identity is an email address or domain that you use when  you
       send  email.  Before  you can use an identity to send email with Amazon
       Pinpoint, you first have to verify it. By  verifying  an  address,  you
       demonstrate that you're the owner of the address, and that you've given
       Amazon Pinpoint permission to send email from the address.

       When you verify an email address, Amazon Pinpoint sends an email to the
       address.  Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link
       in the verification email.

       When you verify a domain, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens,
       which  you can convert into CNAME tokens. You add these CNAME tokens to
       the DNS configuration for your domain. Your  domain  is  verified  when
       Amazon Pinpoint detects these records in the DNS configuration for your
       domain. It usually takes around 72 hours to complete the domain verifi-
       cation process.

OPTIONS
       --email-identity (string)
          The email address or domain that you want to verify.

       --tags (list)
          An  array of objects that define the tags (keys and values) that you
          want to associate with the email identity.

          (structure)
              An object that defines the tags that are associated with  a  re-
              source.  A  tag  is a label that you optionally define and asso-
              ciate with a resource in Amazon Pinpoint. Tags can help you cat-
              egorize  and manage resources in different ways, such as by pur-
              pose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have
              as many as 50 tags.

              Each  tag  consists  of a required tag key and an associated tag
              value , both of which you define. A tag key is a  general  label
              that  acts  as  a  category for a more specific tag value. A tag
              value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can  con-
              tain  as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many
              as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode  letters,  dig-
              its,  white  space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = +
              -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique  and
                it can have only one value.

              o The aws: prefix is reserved for use by AWS; you cant use it in
                any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can't
                edit  or  remove tag keys or values that use this prefix. Tags
                that use this prefix dont count against the limit of  50  tags
                per resource.

              o You  can  associate  tags with public or shared resources, but
                the tags are available only for  your  AWS  account,  not  any
                other  accounts that share the resource. In addition, the tags
                are available only for resources that are located in the spec-
                ified AWS Region for your AWS account.

              Key -> (string)
                 One  part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum
                 length of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length  is
                 1 character.

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The
                 maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters. The  minimum
                 length is 0 characters. If you dont want a resource to have a
                 specific tag value, dont specify a value for this  parameter.
                 Amazon Pinpoint will set the value to an empty string.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       IdentityType -> (string)
          The email identity type.

       VerifiedForSendingStatus -> (boolean)
          Specifies whether or not the identity is verified.  In  Amazon  Pin-
          point,  you can only send email from verified email addresses or do-
          mains. For more information  about  verifying  identities,  see  the
          Amazon Pinpoint User Guide .

       DkimAttributes -> (structure)
          An  object  that  contains information about the DKIM attributes for
          the identity. This object includes the tokens that you use to create
          the  CNAME  records that are required to complete the DKIM verifica-
          tion process.

          SigningEnabled -> (boolean)
              If the value is true , then the messages  that  Amazon  Pinpoint
              sends from the identity are DKIM-signed. If the value is false ,
              then the messages that Amazon Pinpoint sends from  the  identity
              aren't DKIM-signed.

          Status -> (string)
              Describes  whether  or  not Amazon Pinpoint has successfully lo-
              cated the DKIM records in the DNS records for  the  domain.  The
              status can be one of the following:

              o PENDING   Amazon  Pinpoint hasn't yet located the DKIM records
                in the DNS configuration for the domain, but will continue  to
                attempt to locate them.

              o SUCCESS   Amazon  Pinpoint located the DKIM records in the DNS
                configuration for the domain and determined that they're  cor-
                rect.  Amazon Pinpoint can now send DKIM-signed email from the
                identity.

              o FAILED  Amazon Pinpoint was unable to locate the DKIM  records
                in  the  DNS  settings  for  the domain, and won't continue to
                search for them.

              o TEMPORARY_FAILURE  A temporary issue occurred, which prevented
                Amazon  Pinpoint  from determining the DKIM status for the do-
                main.

              o NOT_STARTED  Amazon Pinpoint hasn't yet started searching  for
                the DKIM records in the DKIM records for the domain.

          Tokens -> (list)
              A  set  of  unique strings that you use to create a set of CNAME
              records that you add to the DNS configuration for  your  domain.
              When Amazon Pinpoint detects these records in the DNS configura-
              tion for your domain, the DKIM authentication  process  is  com-
              plete.  Amazon  Pinpoint  usually  detects  these records within
              about 72 hours of adding them to the DNS configuration for  your
              domain.
