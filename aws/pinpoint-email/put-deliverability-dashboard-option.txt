DESCRIPTION
       Enable or disable the Deliverability dashboard for your Amazon Pinpoint
       account. When you enable the Deliverability dashboard, you gain  access
       to  reputation,  deliverability, and other metrics for the domains that
       you use to send email using Amazon Pinpoint. You also gain the  ability
       to perform predictive inbox placement tests.

       When  you use the Deliverability dashboard, you pay a monthly subscrip-
       tion charge, in addition to any other fees that  you  accrue  by  using
       Amazon  Pinpoint. For more information about the features and cost of a
       Deliverability dashboard subscription, see Amazon Pinpoint Pricing .

       the string will be taken literally.

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
