GET-DEDICATED-IPS()                                        GET-DEDICATED-IPS()



NAME
       get-dedicated-ips -

DESCRIPTION
       List  the  dedicated  IP addresses that are associated with your Amazon
       Pinpoint account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-dedicated-ips is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: DedicatedIps

OPTIONS
       --pool-name (string)
          The  name of the IP pool that the dedicated IP address is associated
          with.

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       DedicatedIps -> (list)
          A list of dedicated IP addresses that are reserved for use  by  your
          Amazon Pinpoint account.

          (structure)
              Contains  information about a dedicated IP address that is asso-
              ciated with your Amazon Pinpoint account.

              Ip -> (string)
                 An IP address that is reserved for use by  your  Amazon  Pin-

              WarmupStatus -> (string)
                 The  warm-up status of a dedicated IP address. The status can
                 have one of the following values:

                 o IN_PROGRESS  The IP address isn't ready to use because  the
                   dedicated IP warm-up process is ongoing.

                 o DONE  The dedicated IP warm-up process is complete, and the
                   IP address is ready to use.

              WarmupPercentage -> (integer)
                 Indicates how complete the dedicated IP warm-up  process  is.
                 When  this  value  equals  1,  the  address has completed the
                 warm-up process and is ready for use.

              PoolName -> (string)
                 The name of the dedicated IP pool that the IP address is  as-
                 sociated with.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates that there are additional dedicated IP ad-
          dresses to list. To view additional addresses, issue another request
          to GetDedicatedIps , passing this token in the NextToken parameter.
