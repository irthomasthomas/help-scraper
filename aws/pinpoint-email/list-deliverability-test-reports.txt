NAME
       list-deliverability-test-reports -

DESCRIPTION
       Show  a  list  of the predictive inbox placement tests that you've per-
       formed, regardless of their statuses. For  predictive  inbox  placement
       tests  that  are  complete, you can use the GetDeliverabilityTestReport
       operation to view the results.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-deliverability-test-reports is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: DeliverabilityTestReports

OPTIONS
       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       DeliverabilityTestReports -> (list)
          An object that contains a lists of predictive inbox placement  tests
          that you've performed.

          (structure)
              An  object  that contains metadata related to a predictive inbox
              placement test.

              ReportId -> (string)
                 A unique string that identifies the predictive  inbox  place-
                 ment test.

              ReportName -> (string)
                 A  name  that helps you identify a predictive inbox placement
                 test report.

              Subject -> (string)
                 The subject line for an email that you submitted in a predic-
                 tive inbox placement test.

              FromEmailAddress -> (string)
                 The  sender address that you specified for the predictive in-
                 box placement test.

              CreateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the predictive  inbox  placement  test
                 was created, in Unix time format.

              DeliverabilityTestStatus -> (string)
                 The  status  of  the  predictive inbox placement test. If the
                 status is IN_PROGRESS , then the predictive  inbox  placement
                 test  is  currently running. Predictive inbox placement tests
                 are usually complete within 24 hours of creating the test. If
                 the  status  is COMPLETE , then the test is finished, and you
                 can use the GetDeliverabilityTestReport to view  the  results
                 of the test.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates that there are additional predictive inbox
          placement tests to list. To view additional predictive inbox  place-
          ment tests, issue another request to ListDeliverabilityTestReports ,
          and pass this token in the NextToken parameter.
