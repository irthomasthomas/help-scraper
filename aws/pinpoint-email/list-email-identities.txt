LIST-EMAIL-IDENTITIES()                                LIST-EMAIL-IDENTITIES()



NAME
       list-email-identities -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of all of the email identities that are associated with
       your Amazon Pinpoint account. An identity can be either  an  email  ad-
       dress  or a domain. This operation returns identities that are verified
       as well as those that aren't.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-email-identities is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: EmailIdentities

OPTIONS
       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       EmailIdentities -> (list)
          An  array  that  includes all of the identities associated with your
          Amazon Pinpoint account.

          (structure)
              Information about an email identity.

              IdentityType -> (string)
                 The email identity type. The identity type can be one of  the
                 following:

                 o EMAIL_ADDRESS  The identity is an email address.

                 o DOMAIN  The identity is a domain.

                 o MANAGED_DOMAIN  The identity is a domain that is managed by
                   AWS.

              IdentityName -> (string)
                 The address or domain of the identity.

              SendingEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether or not you can send email  from  the  iden-
                 tity.

                 In Amazon Pinpoint, an identity is an email address or domain
                 that you send email from. Before you can send email  from  an
                 identity,  you  have to demostrate that you own the identity,
                 and that you authorize Amazon Pinpoint  to  send  email  from
                 that identity.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token that indicates that there are additional configuration sets
          to list. To view additional configuration sets,  issue  another  re-
          quest  to ListEmailIdentities , and pass this token in the NextToken
          parameter.
