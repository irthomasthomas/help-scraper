NAME
       get-configuration-set-event-destinations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve  a  list of event destinations that are associated with a con-
       figuration set.

       In Amazon Pinpoint, events include message  sends,  deliveries,  opens,
       clicks, bounces, and complaints. Event destinations are places that you
       can send information about these events to. For example, you  can  send
       event  data  to  Amazon  SNS  to receive notifications when you receive
       bounces or complaints, or you can use Amazon Kinesis Data  Firehose  to
       stream data to Amazon S3 for long-term storage.

OPTIONS
       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The  name  of the configuration set that contains the event destina-
          tion.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

OUTPUT
       EventDestinations -> (list)
          An array that includes all of the events destinations that have been
          configured for the configuration set.

          (structure)
              In Amazon Pinpoint, events include  message  sends,  deliveries,
              opens,  clicks,  bounces, and complaints. Event destinations are
              places that you can send information about these events to.  For
              example,  you can send event data to Amazon SNS to receive noti-
              fications when you receive bounces or complaints, or you can use
              Amazon  Kinesis  Data  Firehose  to stream data to Amazon S3 for
              long-term storage.

              Name -> (string)
                 A name that identifies the event destination.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 If true , the event destination is enabled.  When  the  event
                 destination is enabled, the specified event types are sent to
                 the destinations in this EventDestinationDefinition .

                 If false , the event destination is disabled. When the  event
                 destination  is disabled, events aren't sent to the specified
                 destinations.

              MatchingEventTypes -> (list)
                 The types of events that Amazon Pinpoint sends to the  speci-
                 fied event destinations.

                     (structure)
                        An object that defines the dimension configuration  to
                        use when you send Amazon Pinpoint email events to Ama-
