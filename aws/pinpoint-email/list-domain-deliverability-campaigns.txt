OPTIONS
       --start-date (timestamp)
          The first day, in Unix time format, that you want to obtain deliver-
          ability data for.

       --end-date (timestamp)
          The  last day, in Unix time format, that you want to obtain deliver-
          ability data for. This value has to be less than or equal to 30 days
          after the value of the StartDate parameter.

       --subscribed-domain (string)
          The domain to obtain deliverability data for.

       --next-token (string)
          A  token thats returned from a previous call to the ListDomainDeliv-
          erabilityCampaigns operation. This token indicates the position of a
          campaign in the list of campaigns.

       --page-size (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  results to include in response to a single
          call to the ListDomainDeliverabilityCampaigns operation. If the num-
          ber  of  results  is larger than the number that you specify in this
          parameter, the response includes a NextToken element, which you  can
          use to obtain additional results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

                 that Amazon Pinpoint assigns to campaigns that you create and
