          About control APIs

       These interfaces allow you to apply the Amazon Web Services library  of
       pre-defined controls to your organizational units, programmatically. In
       Amazon Web Services Control Tower, the terms "control" and  "guardrail"
       are synonyms.

       To call these APIs, you'll need to know:

       o the  controlIdentifier for the control--or guardrail--you are target-
         ing.

       o the ARN associated with the target organizational unit (OU), which we
         call the targetIdentifier .

       o the ARN associated with a resource that you wish to tag or untag.
          To  get  the ``controlIdentifier`` for your Amazon Web Services Con-
          trol Tower control:

       The controlIdentifier is an ARN that is specified for each control. You
       can  view  the  controlIdentifier in the console on the Control details
       page, as well as in the documentation.
          About identifiers for Amazon Web Services Control Tower

       The Amazon Web Services Control Tower controlIdentifier  is  unique  in
       each Amazon Web Services Region for each control. You can find the con-
       trolIdentifier for each Region and control in  the  Tables  of  control
       metadata or the Control availability by Region tables in the Amazon Web
       Services Control Tower Controls Reference Guide .

       A quick-reference list of control identifers for the  Amazon  Web  Ser-
       vices  Control  Tower legacy Strongly recommended and Elective controls
       is given in Resource identifiers for APIs and controls in the `  Amazon
       Web     Services     Control    Tower    Controls    Reference    Guide
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/controlreference/control-identifiers.html`__
       . Remember that Mandatory controls cannot be added or removed.

       NOTE:
                 Some controls have two identifiers

              o ARN   format   for   Amazon   Web   Services   Control  Tower:
                arn:aws:controltower:{REGION}::control/{CON-
                TROL_TOWER_OPAQUE_ID}           Example:          arn:aws:con-
                troltower:us-west-2::control/AWS-GR_AUTOSCALING_LAUNCH_CON-
                FIG_PUBLIC_IP_DISABLED

              o ARN format for Amazon Web Services Control Catalog:  arn:{PAR-
                TITION}:controlcatalog:::control/{CONTROL_CATALOG_OPAQUE_ID}

              You can find the {CONTROL_CATALOG_OPAQUE_ID} in the ` Amazon Web
              Services     Control     Tower    Controls    Reference    Guide
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/controlreference/all-global-identifiers.html`__
              ,  or  in  the Amazon Web Services Control Tower console, on the
              Control details page.

              The Amazon Web Services Control Tower APIs for enabled controls,
              such  as GetEnabledControl and ListEnabledControls always return
              an ARN of the same type given when the control was enabled.

          To get the ``targetIdentifier`` :

       The targetIdentifier is the ARN for an OU.

       In the Amazon Web Services Organizations console, you can find the  ARN
       for the OU on the Organizational unit details page associated with that
       OU.

       NOTE:
              OU ARN format:

              arn:${Partition}:organizations::${MasterAccountId}:ou/o-${Orga-
              nizationId}/ou-${OrganizationalUnitId}

          About landing zone APIs

       You can configure and launch an Amazon Web Services Control Tower land-
       ing zone with APIs. For an introduction and steps, see Getting  started
       with Amazon Web Services Control Tower using APIs .

       For an overview of landing zone API operations, see Amazon Web Services
       Control Tower supports landing zone APIs . The  individual  API  opera-
       tions  for  landing zones are detailed in this document, the API refer-
       ence manual , in the "Actions" section.
          About baseline APIs

       You can apply the AWSControlTowerBaseline baseline to an organizational
       unit  (OU) as a way to register the OU with Amazon Web Services Control
       Tower, programmatically. For a general overview of this capability, see
       Amazon Web Services Control Tower supports APIs for OU registration and
       configuration with baselines .

       You can call the baseline API operations to  view  the  baselines  that
       Amazon  Web  Services  Control  Tower enables for your landing zone, on
       your behalf, when setting up the  landing  zone.  These  baselines  are
       read-only baselines.

       The  individual API operations for baselines are detailed in this docu-
       ment, the API reference manual , in the "Actions"  section.  For  usage
       examples, see Baseline API input and output examples with CLI .
          About Amazon Web Services Control Catalog identifiers

       o The  EnableControl and DisableControl API operations can be called by
         specifying either the Amazon Web Services Control Tower identifer  or
         the  Amazon Web Services Control Catalog identifier. The API response
         returns the same type of identifier that you specified  when  calling
         the API.

       o If  you  use  an Amazon Web Services Control Tower identifier to call
         the EnableControl API, and then call EnableControl again with an Ama-
         zon Web Services Control Catalog identifier, Amazon Web Services Con-
         trol Tower returns an error message stating that the control  is  al-
         ready enabled. Similar behavior applies to the DisableControl API op-
         eration.

       o Mandatory controls and the  landing-zone-level  Region  deny  control
         have Amazon Web Services Control Tower identifiers only.

          Recording API Requests

       Amazon  Web  Services Control Tower supports Amazon Web Services Cloud-
       Trail, a service that records Amazon Web Services API  calls  for  your
       Amazon  Web  Services  account  and  delivers log files to an Amazon S3
       bucket. By using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine
       which  requests the Amazon Web Services Control Tower service received,
       who made the request and when, and so on. For  more  about  Amazon  Web
       Services Control Tower and its support for CloudTrail, see Logging Ama-
       zon Web Services Control Tower Actions with Amazon Web Services  Cloud-
       Trail  in  the  Amazon  Web Services Control Tower User Guide. To learn
       more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and  find  your  log
       files, see the Amazon Web Services CloudTrail User Guide.
