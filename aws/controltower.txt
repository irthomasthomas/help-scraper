NAME
       controltower -

DESCRIPTION
       These  interfaces allow you to apply the Amazon Web Services library of
       pre-defined controls to your organizational units, programmatically. In
       Amazon  Web Services Control Tower, the terms "control" and "guardrail"
       are synonyms.

       To call these APIs, you'll need to know:

       o the controlIdentifier for the control--or guardrail--you are  target-
         ing.

       o the ARN associated with the target organizational unit (OU), which we
         call the targetIdentifier .

       o the ARN associated with a resource that you wish to tag or untag.
          To get the ``controlIdentifier`` for your Amazon Web  Services  Con-
          trol Tower control:

       The controlIdentifier is an ARN that is specified for each control. You
       can view the controlIdentifier in the console on  the  Control  details
       page, as well as in the documentation.

       The  controlIdentifier is unique in each Amazon Web Services Region for
       each control. You can find the controlIdentifier for  each  Region  and
       control  in  the  Tables of control metadata in the Amazon Web Services
       Control Tower User Guide.

       A quick-reference list of control identifers for the  Amazon  Web  Ser-
       vices  Control  Tower legacy Strongly recommended and Elective controls
       is given in Resource identifiers for APIs and controls in the  Controls
       reference  guide  section of the Amazon Web Services Control Tower User
       Guide . Remember that Mandatory controls cannot be added or removed.

       NOTE:
              ARN    format:      arn:aws:controltower:{REGION}::control/{CON-
              TROL_NAME}

              Example:

              arn:aws:controltower:us-west-2::control/AWS-GR_AUTOSCAL-
              ING_LAUNCH_CONFIG_PUBLIC_IP_DISABLED

          To get the ``targetIdentifier`` :

       The targetIdentifier is the ARN for an OU.

       In the Amazon Web Services Organizations console, you can find the  ARN
       for the OU on the Organizational unit details page associated with that
       OU.

       NOTE:
              OU ARN format:

              arn:${Partition}:organizations::${MasterAccountId}:ou/o-${Orga-
              nizationId}/ou-${OrganizationalUnitId}

          Recording API Requests

       Amazon  Web  Services Control Tower supports Amazon Web Services Cloud-
       Trail, a service that records Amazon Web Services API  calls  for  your
       Amazon  Web  Services  account  and  delivers log files to an Amazon S3
       bucket. By using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine
       which  requests the Amazon Web Services Control Tower service received,
       who made the request and when, and so on. For  more  about  Amazon  Web
       Services Control Tower and its support for CloudTrail, see Logging Ama-
       zon Web Services Control Tower Actions with Amazon Web Services  Cloud-
       Trail  in  the  Amazon  Web Services Control Tower User Guide. To learn
       more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and  find  your  log
       files, see the Amazon Web Services CloudTrail User Guide.
