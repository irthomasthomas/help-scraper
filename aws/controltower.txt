NAME
       controltower -

DESCRIPTION
       These interfaces allow you to apply the AWS library of pre-defined con-
       trols to your organizational units, programmatically. In this  context,
       controls are the same as AWS Control Tower guardrails.

       To call these APIs, you'll need to know:

       o the  ControlARN for the control--that is, the guardrail--you are tar-
         geting,

       o and the ARN associated with the target organizational unit (OU).
          To get the ``ControlARN`` for your AWS Control Tower guardrail:

       The ControlARN contains the control name which  is  specified  in  each
       guardrail.  For  a  list  of control names for Strongly recommended and
       Elective guardrails, see Resource identifiers for APIs  and  guardrails
       in  the  Automating  tasks section of the AWS Control Tower User Guide.
       Remember that Mandatory guardrails cannot be added or removed.

       NOTE:
              ARN    format:      arn:aws:controltower:{REGION}::control/{CON-
              TROL_NAME}

              Example:

              arn:aws:controltower:us-west-2::control/AWS-GR_AUTOSCAL-
              ING_LAUNCH_CONFIG_PUBLIC_IP_DISABLED

          To get the ARN for an OU:

       In the AWS Organizations console, you can find the ARN for  the  OU  on
       the Organizational unit details page associated with that OU.

       NOTE:
              OU ARN format:

              arn:${Partition}:organizations::${MasterAccountId}:ou/o-${Orga-
              nizationId}/ou-${OrganizationalUnitId}

          Recording API Requests

       AWS  Control  Tower supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS
       API calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an  Amazon  S3
       bucket. By using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine
       which requests the AWS Control Tower service received, who made the re-
       quest  and  when,  and  so on. For more about AWS Control Tower and its
       support for CloudTrail, see Logging AWS Control Tower Actions with  AWS
       CloudTrail  in  the  AWS  Control Tower User Guide. To learn more about
       CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your  log  files,  see
       the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.
