CONTROLTOWER()                                                  CONTROLTOWER()



NAME
       controltower -

DESCRIPTION
       These interfaces allow you to apply the AWS library of pre-defined con-
       trols to your organizational units, programmatically.  In  AWS  Control
       Tower, the terms "control" and "guardrail" are synonyms. .

       To call these APIs, you'll need to know:

       o the  controlIdentifier for the control--or guardrail--you are target-
         ing.

       o the ARN associated with the target organizational unit (OU), which we
         call the targetIdentifier .
          To get the ``controlIdentifier`` for your AWS Control Tower control:

       The controlIdentifier is an ARN that is specified for each control. You
       can view the controlIdentifier in the console on  the  Control  details
       page, as well as in the documentation.

       The  controlIdentifier  is  unique in each AWS Region for each control.
       You can find the controlIdentifier for each Region and control  in  the
       Tables of control metadata in the AWS Control Tower User Guide.

       A  quick-reference list of control identifers for the AWS Control Tower
       legacy Strongly recommended and Elective controls is given in  Resource
       identifiers  for  APIs  and  guardrails in the Controls reference guide
       section of the AWS Control Tower User Guide . Remember  that  Mandatory
       controls cannot be added or removed.

       NOTE:
              ARN     format:     arn:aws:controltower:{REGION}::control/{CON-
              TROL_NAME}

              Example:

              arn:aws:controltower:us-west-2::control/AWS-GR_AUTOSCAL-
              ING_LAUNCH_CONFIG_PUBLIC_IP_DISABLED

          To get the ``targetIdentifier`` :

       The targetIdentifier is the ARN for an OU.

       In  the  AWS  Organizations console, you can find the ARN for the OU on
       the Organizational unit details page associated with that OU.

       NOTE:
              OU ARN format:

              arn:${Partition}:organizations::${MasterAccountId}:ou/o-${Orga-
              nizationId}/ou-${OrganizationalUnitId}

          Recording API Requests

       AWS Control Tower supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that  records  AWS
       API  calls  for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3
       bucket. By using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine
       which requests the AWS Control Tower service received, who made the re-
       quest and when, and so on. For more about AWS  Control  Tower  and  its
       support  for CloudTrail, see Logging AWS Control Tower Actions with AWS
       CloudTrail in the AWS Control Tower User Guide.  To  learn  more  about
       CloudTrail,  including  how  to turn it on and find your log files, see
       the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.
