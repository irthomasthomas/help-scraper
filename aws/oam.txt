DESCRIPTION
       Use Amazon CloudWatch Observability Access Manager to create and manage
       links between source accounts and monitoring accounts by  using  Cloud-
       Watch  cross-account  observability . With CloudWatch cross-account ob-
       servability, you can monitor and troubleshoot  applications  that  span
       multiple  accounts  within  a Region. Seamlessly search, visualize, and
       analyze your metrics, logs, and traces in any of  the  linked  accounts
       without account boundaries.
          <p>Set  up one or more Amazon Web Services accounts as <i>monitoring
          accounts</i> and link them with multiple <i>source  accounts</i>.  A
          monitoring account is a central Amazon Web Services account that can
          view and interact with observability data generated from source  ac-
          counts.  A  source  account is an individual Amazon Web Services ac-
          count that generates observability data for the resources  that  re-
          side  in it. Source accounts share their observability data with the
          monitoring account. The shared observability data can  include  met-
          rics  in  Amazon  CloudWatch,  logs  in  Amazon CloudWatch Logs, and
          traces in X-Ray.</p>
