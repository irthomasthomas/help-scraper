DESCRIPTION
       Use Amazon CloudWatch Observability Access Manager to create and manage
       links between source accounts and monitoring accounts by  using  Cloud-
       Watch  cross-account  observability . With CloudWatch cross-account ob-
       servability, you can monitor and troubleshoot  applications  that  span
       multiple  accounts  within  a Region. Seamlessly search, visualize, and
       analyze your metrics, logs, traces, and Application  Insights  applica-
       tions in any of the linked accounts without account boundaries.

       Set  up one or more Amazon Web Services accounts as monitoring accounts
       and link them with multiple source accounts . A monitoring account is a
       central Amazon Web Services account that can view and interact with ob-
       servability data generated from source accounts. A source account is an
       individual  Amazon  Web  Services  account that generates observability
       data for the resources that reside in it. Source accounts  share  their
       observability  data with the monitoring account. The shared observabil-
       ity data can include metrics  in  Amazon  CloudWatch,  logs  in  Amazon
       CloudWatch Logs, traces in X-Ray, and applications in Amazon CloudWatch
       Application Insights.
