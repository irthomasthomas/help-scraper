IMPORT-MODEL()                                                  IMPORT-MODEL()



NAME
       import-model -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new custom model that replicates a source custom model that
       you import. The source model can be in your Amazon Web Services account
       or another one.

       If  the source model is in another Amazon Web Services account, then it
       must have a resource-based policy that authorizes you to import it.

       The source model must be in the same Amazon Web  Services  Region  that
       you're using when you import. You can't import a model that's in a dif-
       ferent Region.

OPTIONS
       --source-model-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the custom model to import.

       --model-name (string)
          The name to assign to the custom model that  is  created  in  Amazon
          Comprehend by this import.

       --version-name (string)
          The  version  name given to the custom model that is created by this
          import. Version names can have a maximum of 256 characters. Alphanu-
          meric  characters,  hyphens (-) and underscores (_) are allowed. The
          version name must be unique among all models with the  same  classi-
          fier name in the account/Region.

       --model-kms-key-id (string)
          ID  for  the  KMS key that Amazon Comprehend uses to encrypt trained
          custom models. The ModelKmsKeyId can be either of the following for-
          mats:

          o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

          o Amazon     Resource     Name     (ARN)     of     a    KMS    Key:
            "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

       --data-access-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the IAM role that grants Amazon
          Comprehend permission to use Amazon Key Management Service (KMS)  to
          encrypt or decrypt the custom model.

       --tags (list)
          Tags  to associate with the custom model that is created by this im-
          port. A tag is a key-value pair that adds as a  metadata  to  a  re-
          source used by Amazon Comprehend. For example, a tag with "Sales" as
          the key might be added to a resource to  indicate  its  use  by  the
          sales department.

          (structure)
              A  key-value  pair that adds as a metadata to a resource used by
              Amazon Comprehend. For example, a tag with  the  key-value  pair
              Department:Sales  might  be  added to a resource to indicate its
              use by a particular department.

              Key -> (string)
                 The initial part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show
                 which resources are used by which departments, you might  use
                 Department as the key portion of the pair, with multiple pos-
                 sible values such as sales, legal, and administration.

              Value -> (string)
                 The second part of a key-value pair that forms a tag  associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show
                 which resources are used by which departments, you might  use
                 Department  as  the initial (key) portion of the pair, with a
                 value of sales to indicate the sales department.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To import a model

       The following import-model example imports a model from a different AWS
       account.  The  document  classifier model in account 444455556666 has a
       resource-based policy  allowing  account  111122223333  to  import  the
       model.

          aws comprehend import-model \
              --source-model-arn arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:444455556666:document-classifier/example-classifier

       Output:

          {
              "ModelArn": "arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:document-classifier/example-classifier"
          }

       For more information, see Copying custom models between AWS accounts in
       the Amazon Comprehend Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       ModelArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the custom model being imported.
