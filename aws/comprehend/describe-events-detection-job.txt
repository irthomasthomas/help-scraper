OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The identifier of the events detection job.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       EventsDetectionJobProperties -> (structure)
          An object that contains the properties associated with an event  de-
          tection job.

          JobId -> (string)
              The identifier assigned to the events detection job.

          JobArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the events detection job. It
              is a unique, fully qualified identifier for the job. It includes
              the  AWS  account, Region, and the job ID. The format of the ARN
              is as follows:
                 arn:<partition>:comprehend:<region>:<account-id>:events-de-
                 tection-job/<job-id>

              The following is an example job ARN:
                 arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:events-detec-
                 tion-job/1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab

          JobName -> (string)
              The name you assigned the events detection job.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the events detection job.

          Message -> (string)
              A description of the status of the events detection job.

          SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the events detection job was  submitted  for  pro-
              cessing.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the events detection job completed.

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The  input data configuration that you supplied when you created
              the events detection job.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must be in same
                 region  as the API endpoint that you are calling. The URI can
                 point to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for
                 a collection of data files.

                 For  example,  if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix , if
                 the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file
                 as  input. If more than one file begins with the prefix, Ama-
                 zon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

              InputFormat -> (string)
                 Specifies how the text in an input file should be processed:

                 o ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is considered a separate docu-
                   ment.  Use  this option when you are processing large docu-
                   ments, such as newspaper articles or scientific papers.

                 o ONE_DOC_PER_LINE - Each line in a file is considered a sep-
                   arate  document.  Use  this  option when you are processing
                   many short documents, such as text messages.

              DocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)
                 The document reader config field applies only for  InputData-
                 Config of StartEntitiesDetectionJob.

                 Use  DocumentReaderConfig to provide specifications about how
                 you want your inference documents read. Currently it  applies
                 for  PDF documents in StartEntitiesDetectionJob custom infer-
                 ence.

                 DocumentReadAction -> (string)
                     This enum field will start with two values which will ap-
                     ply to PDFs:

                     o TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT  -  The service calls De-
                       tectDocumentText for PDF documents per page.

                     o TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT - The service calls  Analyze-
                       Document for PDF documents per page.

                 DocumentReadMode -> (string)
                     This enum field provides two values:

                     o SERVICE_DEFAULT  -  use  service  defaults for Document
                       reading. For Digital PDF it would mean using an  inter-
                       nal parser instead of Textract APIs

                     o FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION  -  Always use specified ac-
                       tion for DocumentReadAction, including Digital PDF.

                 FeatureTypes -> (list)
                     Specifies how the text in an input file  should  be  pro-
                     cessed:

                     (string)
                        A list of the types of analyses to perform. This field
                        specifies what feature types need to be extracted from
                        the document where entity recognition is expected.

                        o TABLES  -  Add TABLES to the list to return informa-
                          tion about the tables that are detected in the input
                          document.

                        o FORMS - Add FORMS to return detected form data.

          OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The output data configuration that you supplied when you created
              the events detection job.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 When you use the OutputDataConfig  object  with  asynchronous
                 operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where you want
                 to write the output data. The URI must be in the same  region
                 as  the  API  endpoint  that you are calling. The location is
                 used as the prefix for the  actual  location  of  the  output
                 file.

                 When the topic detection job is finished, the service creates
                 an output file in a directory specific to the job. The  S3Uri
                 field  contains  the location of the output file, called out-
                 put.tar.gz . It is a compressed  archive  that  contains  the
                 ouput of the operation.

                 For  a  PII  entity  detection  job, the output file is plain
                 text, not a compressed archive. The output file name  is  the
                 same as the input file, with .out appended at the end.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 ID  for  the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key that Amazon
                 Comprehend uses to encrypt the output results from an  analy-
                 sis job. The KmsKeyId can be one of the following formats:

                 o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                 o Amazon    Resource    Name    (ARN)    of    a   KMS   Key:
                   "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                 o KMS Key Alias: "alias/ExampleAlias"

                 o ARN         of        a        KMS        Key        Alias:
                   "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias"

          LanguageCode -> (string)
              The language code of the input documents.

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS  Identify  and  Access
              Management  (IAM) role that grants Amazon Comprehend read access
              to your input data.

          TargetEventTypes -> (list)
              The types of events that are detected by the job.

              (string)
