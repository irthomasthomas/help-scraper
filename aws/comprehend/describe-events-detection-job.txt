          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The identifier of the events detection job.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       EventsDetectionJobProperties -> (structure)
          An  object that contains the properties associated with an event de-
          tection job.

          JobId -> (string)
              The identifier assigned to the events detection job.

          JobArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the events detection  job.  It
              is a unique, fully qualified identifier for the job. It includes
              the Amazon Web Services account, Amazon Web Services Region, and
              the job ID. The format of the ARN is as follows:
                 arn:<partition>:comprehend:<region>:<account-id>:events-de-
                 tection-job/<job-id>

              The following is an example job ARN:
                 arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:events-detec-
                 tion-job/1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab

          JobName -> (string)
              The name you assigned the events detection job.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the events detection job.

          Message -> (string)
              A description of the status of the events detection job.

          SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
              The  time  that  the events detection job was submitted for pro-
              cessing.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the events detection job completed.

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The input data configuration that you supplied when you  created
              the events detection job.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must be in same
                 Region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The URI  can
                 point to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for
                 a collection of data files.

                 For example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix  ,  if
                 the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file
                 as input. If more than one file begins with the prefix,  Ama-
                 zon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

              InputFormat -> (string)
                 Specifies how the text in an input file should be processed:

                 o ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is considered a separate docu-
                   ment. Use this option when you are processing  large  docu-
                   ments, such as newspaper articles or scientific papers.

                 o ONE_DOC_PER_LINE - Each line in a file is considered a sep-
                   arate document. Use this option  when  you  are  processing
                   many short documents, such as text messages.

              DocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)
                 Provides configuration parameters to override the default ac-
                 tions for extracting text from PDF documents and image files.

                 DocumentReadAction -> (string)
                     This field defines the Amazon Textract API operation that
                     Amazon Comprehend uses to extract text from PDF files and
                     image files. Enter one of the following values:

                     o TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT - The  Amazon  Comprehend
                       service uses the DetectDocumentText API operation.

                     o TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT  - The Amazon Comprehend ser-
                       vice uses the AnalyzeDocument API operation.

                 DocumentReadMode -> (string)
                     Determines the text extraction actions for PDF files. En-
                     ter one of the following values:

                     o SERVICE_DEFAULT - use the Amazon Comprehend service de-
                       faults for PDF files.

                     o FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION - Amazon Comprehend uses the
                       Textract  API  specified  by DocumentReadAction for all
                       PDF files, including digital PDF files.

                 FeatureTypes -> (list)
                     Specifies the type of Amazon Textract features to  apply.
                     If  you  chose  TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT as the read ac-
                     tion, you must specify one or both of the following  val-
                     ues:

                     o TABLES  -  Returns additional information about any ta-
                       bles that are detected in the input document.

                     o FORMS - Returns additional information about any  forms
                       that are detected in the input document.

                     (string)
                        TABLES or FORMS

          OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The output data configuration that you supplied when you created
              the events detection job.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 When you use the OutputDataConfig  object  with  asynchronous
                 operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where you want
                 to write the output data. The URI must be in the same  Region
                 as  the  API  endpoint  that you are calling. The location is
                 used as the prefix for the  actual  location  of  the  output
                 file.

                 When the topic detection job is finished, the service creates
                 an output file in a directory specific to the job. The  S3Uri
                 field  contains  the location of the output file, called out-
                 put.tar.gz . It is a compressed  archive  that  contains  the
                 ouput of the operation.

                 For  a  PII  entity  detection  job, the output file is plain
                 text, not a compressed archive. The output file name  is  the
                 same as the input file, with .out appended at the end.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 ID  for  the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS)
                 key that Amazon Comprehend uses to encrypt the output results
                 from  an analysis job. Specify the Key Id of a symmetric key,
                 because you cannot use an asymmetric key for  uploading  data
                 to S3.

                 The KmsKeyId can be one of the following formats:

                 o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                 o Amazon    Resource    Name    (ARN)    of    a   KMS   Key:
                   "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                 o KMS Key Alias: "alias/ExampleAlias"

                 o ARN         of        a        KMS        Key        Alias:
                   "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias"

          LanguageCode -> (string)
              The language code of the input documents.

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that grants  Ama-
              zon Comprehend read access to your input data.

          TargetEventTypes -> (list)
              The types of events that are detected by the job.

              (string)
