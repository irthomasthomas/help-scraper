LIST-DOCUMENT-CLASSIFIERS()                        LIST-DOCUMENT-CLASSIFIERS()



NAME
       list-document-classifiers -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of the document classifiers that you have created.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-document-classifiers  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: DocumentClassifierPropertiesList

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Filters the jobs that are returned. You can  filter  jobs  on  their
          name, status, or the date and time that they were submitted. You can
          only set one filter at a time.

          Status -> (string)
              Filters the list of classifiers based on status.

          DocumentClassifierName -> (string)
              The name that you assigned to the document classifier

          SubmitTimeBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of classifiers based on the time that the clas-
              sifier  was  submitted  for processing. Returns only classifiers
              submitted before the specified time. Classifiers are returned in
              ascending order, oldest to newest.

          SubmitTimeAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of classifiers based on the time that the clas-
              sifier was submitted for processing.  Returns  only  classifiers
              submitted  after the specified time. Classifiers are returned in
              descending order, newest to oldest.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Status=string,DocumentClassifierName=string,SubmitTimeBefore=timestamp,SubmitTimeAfter=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Status": "SUBMITTED"|"TRAINING"|"DELETING"|"STOP_REQUESTED"|"STOPPED"|"IN_ERROR"|"TRAINED"|"TRAINED_WITH_WARNING",
            "DocumentClassifierName": "string",
            "SubmitTimeBefore": timestamp,
            "SubmitTimeAfter": timestamp
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       DocumentClassifierPropertiesList -> (list)
          A list containing the properties of each job returned.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a document classifier.

              DocumentClassifierArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the document
                 classifier.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The language code for the language of the documents that  the
                 classifier was trained on.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  status  of  the  document  classifier.  If the status is
                 TRAINED the classifier is ready to  use.  If  the  status  is
                 TRAINED_WITH_WARNINGS  the classifier training succeeded, but
                 you should review the warnings returned  in  the  CreateDocu-
                 mentClassifier response.

                 If  the  status  is FAILED you can see additional information
                 about why the classifier wasn't trained in the Message field.

              Message -> (string)
                 Additional information about the status of the classifier.

              SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that  the  document  classifier  was  submitted  for
                 training.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that training the document classifier completed.

              TrainingStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 Indicates  the time when the training starts on documentation
                 classifiers. You are billed for  the  time  interval  between
                 this time and the value of TrainingEndTime.

              TrainingEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  that  training of the document classifier was com-
                 pleted. Indicates the time when  the  training  completes  on
                 documentation classifiers. You are billed for the time inter-
                 val between this time and the value of TrainingStartTime.

              InputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The input data configuration that you supplied when you  cre-
                 ated the document classifier for training.

                 DataFormat -> (string)
                     The format of your training data:

                     o COMPREHEND_CSV  :  A  two-column CSV file, where labels
                       are provided in the first  column,  and  documents  are
                       provided in the second. If you use this value, you must
                       provide the S3Uri parameter in your request.

                     o AUGMENTED_MANIFEST : A labeled dataset that is produced
                       by  Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. This file is in JSON
                       lines format. Each line is a complete JSON object  that
                       contains a training document and its associated labels.
                       If you use this value, you must provide the  Augmented-
                       Manifests parameter in your request.

                     If you don't specify a value, Amazon Comprehend uses COM-
                     PREHEND_CSV as the default.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The S3 bucket  must
                     be  in  the  same Region as the API endpoint that you are
                     calling. The URI can point to a single input file  or  it
                     can provide the prefix for a collection of input files.

                     For  example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix ,
                     if the prefix is a single file,  Amazon  Comprehend  uses
                     that file as input. If more than one file begins with the
                     prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

                     This parameter is required if you set DataFormat to  COM-
                     PREHEND_CSV .

                 TestS3Uri -> (string)
                     This  specifies  the Amazon S3 location that contains the
                     test annotations for the  document  classifier.  The  URI
                     must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the API
                     endpoint that you are calling.

                 LabelDelimiter -> (string)
                     Indicates the delimiter used to separate each  label  for
                     training  a multi-label classifier. The default delimiter
                     between labels is a pipe (|). You  can  use  a  different
                     character  as  a delimiter (if it's an allowed character)
                     by specifying it  under  Delimiter  for  labels.  If  the
                     training documents use a delimiter other than the default
                     or the delimiter you specify, the  labels  on  that  line
                     will  be  combined to make a single unique label, such as
                     LABELLABELLABEL.

                 AugmentedManifests -> (list)
                     A list of augmented manifest files that provide  training
                     data for your custom model. An augmented manifest file is
                     a labeled dataset that is produced  by  Amazon  SageMaker
                     Ground Truth.

                     This  parameter is required if you set DataFormat to AUG-
                     MENTED_MANIFEST .

                     (structure)
                        An augmented manifest file that provides training data
                        for your custom model. An augmented manifest file is a
                        labeled dataset that is produced by  Amazon  SageMaker
                        Ground Truth.

                        S3Uri -> (string)
                            The  Amazon  S3 location of the augmented manifest
                            file.

                        Split -> (string)
                            The purpose of the data  you've  provided  in  the
                            augmented  manifest.  You can either train or test
                            this data. If you don't specify,  the  default  is
                            train.

                            TRAIN  - all of the documents in the manifest will
                            be used for training. If  no  test  documents  are
                            provided, Amazon Comprehend will automatically re-
                            serve a portion  of  the  training  documents  for
                            testing.

                            TEST  -  all of the documents in the manifest will
                            be used for testing.

                        AttributeNames -> (list)
                            The JSON attribute that contains  the  annotations
                            for  your training documents. The number of attri-
                            bute names that you  specify  depends  on  whether
                            your  augmented  manifest  file is the output of a
                            single labeling job or a chained labeling job.

                            If your file is the output of  a  single  labeling
                            job,  specify  the LabelAttributeName key that was
                            used when the job was created in Ground Truth.

                            If your file is the output of a  chained  labeling
                            job, specify the LabelAttributeName key for one or
                            more jobs in the  chain.  Each  LabelAttributeName
                            key  provides  the  annotations from an individual
                            job.

                        DocumentType -> (string)
                            The type of augmented manifest.  PlainTextDocument
                            or  SemiStructuredDocument.  If you don't specify,
                            the default is PlainTextDocument.

                            o PLAIN_TEXT_DOCUMENT A document type that  repre-
                              sents any unicode text that is encoded in UTF-8.

                            o SEMI_STRUCTURED_DOCUMENT  A  document  type with
                              positional and structural context, like  a  PDF.
                              For  training  with Amazon Comprehend, only PDFs
                              are supported. For inference, Amazon  Comprehend
                              support PDFs, DOCX and TXT.

                 DocumentType -> (string)
                     The  type of input documents for training the model. Pro-
                     vide plain-text documents to create a  plain-text  model,
                     and  provide semi-structured documents to create a native
                     document model.

                 Documents -> (structure)
                     The S3 location of the training documents. This parameter
                     is  required  in  a  request  to create a native document
                     model.

                     S3Uri -> (string)
                        The S3 URI location of the training  documents  speci-
                        fied in the S3Uri CSV file.

                     TestS3Uri -> (string)
                        The  S3 URI location of the test documents included in
                        the TestS3Uri CSV file. This field is not required  if
                        you do not specify a test CSV file.

                 DocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)
                     Provides configuration parameters to override the default
                     actions for extracting text from PDF documents and  image
                     files.

                     By  default, Amazon Comprehend performs the following ac-
                     tions to extract text from files, based on the input file
                     type:

                     o Word  files  -  Amazon  Comprehend  parser extracts the
                       text.

                     o Digital PDF files - Amazon Comprehend  parser  extracts
                       the text.

                     o Image  files  and scanned PDF files - Amazon Comprehend
                       uses the Amazon Textract DetectDocumentText API to  ex-
                       tract the text.
                        DocumentReaderConfig  does  not  apply  to  plain text
                        files or Word files.

                     For image files and PDF documents, you can override these
                     default  actions  using the fields listed below. For more
                     information, see Setting text extraction options  in  the
                     Comprehend Developer Guide.

                     DocumentReadAction -> (string)
                        This  field  defines the Amazon Textract API operation
                        that Amazon Comprehend uses to extract text  from  PDF
                        files and image files. Enter one of the following val-
                        ues:

                        o TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT - The  Amazon  Compre-
                          hend  service uses the DetectDocumentText API opera-
                          tion.

                        o TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT -  The  Amazon  Comprehend
                          service uses the AnalyzeDocument API operation.

                     DocumentReadMode -> (string)
                        Determines  the text extraction actions for PDF files.
                        Enter one of the following values:

                        o SERVICE_DEFAULT - use the Amazon Comprehend  service
                          defaults for PDF files.

                        o FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION  - Amazon Comprehend uses
                          the Textract API specified by DocumentReadAction for
                          all PDF files, including digital PDF files.

                     FeatureTypes -> (list)
                        Specifies  the type of Amazon Textract features to ap-
                        ply. If you  chose  TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT  as  the
                        read  action, you must specify one or both of the fol-
                        lowing values:

                        o TABLES - Returns information about any  tables  that
                          are detected in the input document.

                        o FORMS  -  Returns  information and the data from any
                          forms that are detected in the input document.

                        (string)
                            Specifies the type of Amazon Textract features  to
                            apply.  If  you chose TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT as
                            the read action, you must specify one or  both  of
                            the following values:

                            o TABLES  -  Returns  additional information about
                              any tables that are detected in the input  docu-
                              ment.

                            o FORMS - Returns additional information about any
                              forms that are detected in the input document.

              OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 Provides output results configuration parameters  for  custom
                 classifier jobs.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     When you use the OutputDataConfig object while creating a
                     custom classifier, you specify  the  Amazon  S3  location
                     where  you  want  to write the confusion matrix and other
                     output files. The URI must be in the same Region  as  the
                     API  endpoint  that you are calling. The location is used
                     as the prefix for the  actual  location  of  this  output
                     file.

                     When  the  custom classifier job is finished, the service
                     creates the output file in a directory  specific  to  the
                     job.  The S3Uri field contains the location of the output
                     file, called output.tar.gz . It is a  compressed  archive
                     that contains the confusion matrix.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     ID  for  the  Amazon  Web Services Key Management Service
                     (KMS) key that Amazon Comprehend uses to encrypt the out-
                     put results from an analysis job. The KmsKeyId can be one
                     of the following formats:

                     o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                     o Amazon   Resource   Name   (ARN)   of   a   KMS    Key:
                       "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                     o KMS Key Alias: "alias/ExampleAlias"

                     o ARN       of       a       KMS        Key        Alias:
                       "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias"

                 FlywheelStatsS3Prefix -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  S3  prefix for the data lake location of the
                     flywheel statistics.

              ClassifierMetadata -> (structure)
                 Information about the document classifier, including the num-
                 ber of documents used for training the classifier, the number
                 of documents used for test the classifier,  and  an  accuracy
                 rating.

                 NumberOfLabels -> (integer)
                     The number of labels in the input data.

                 NumberOfTrainedDocuments -> (integer)
                     The  number of documents in the input data that were used
                     to train the classifier. Typically this is 80 to 90  per-
                     cent of the input documents.

                 NumberOfTestDocuments -> (integer)
                     The  number of documents in the input data that were used
                     to test the classifier. Typically this is 10 to  20  per-
                     cent of the input documents, up to 10,000 documents.

                 EvaluationMetrics -> (structure)
                     Describes the result metrics for the test data associated
                     with an documentation classifier.

                     Accuracy -> (double)
                        The fraction of the labels that  were  correct  recog-
                        nized. It is computed by dividing the number of labels
                        in the test documents that were  correctly  recognized
                        by the total number of labels in the test documents.

                     Precision -> (double)
                        A  measure of the usefulness of the classifier results
                        in the test data. High precision means that the  clas-
                        sifier  returned  substantially  more relevant results
                        than irrelevant ones.

                     Recall -> (double)
                        A measure of how complete the classifier  results  are
                        for  the test data. High recall means that the classi-
                        fier returned most of the relevant results.

                     F1Score -> (double)
                        A measure of how accurate the classifier  results  are
                        for  the  test  data. It is derived from the Precision
                        and Recall values. The F1Score is the harmonic average
                        of  the  two  scores.  The highest score is 1, and the
                        worst score is 0.

                     MicroPrecision -> (double)
                        A measure of the usefulness of the recognizer  results
                        in the test data. High precision means that the recog-
                        nizer returned  substantially  more  relevant  results
                        than  irrelevant  ones.  Unlike  the  Precision metric
                        which comes from averaging the precision of all avail-
                        able labels, this is based on the overall score of all
                        precision scores added together.

                     MicroRecall -> (double)
                        A measure of how complete the classifier  results  are
                        for  the test data. High recall means that the classi-
                        fier returned most of the relevant  results.  Specifi-
                        cally,  this  indicates  how many of the correct cate-
                        gories in the text that the model can predict. It is a
                        percentage  of correct categories in the text that can
                        found. Instead of averaging the recall scores  of  all
                        labels  (as with Recall), micro Recall is based on the
                        overall score of all recall scores added together.

                     MicroF1Score -> (double)
                        A measure of how accurate the classifier  results  are
                        for  the  test  data. It is a combination of the Micro
                        Precision and Micro Recall values. The  Micro  F1Score
                        is  the  harmonic  mean of the two scores. The highest
                        score is 1, and the worst score is 0.

                     HammingLoss -> (double)
                        Indicates the fraction of labels that are  incorrectly
                        predicted.  Also  seen as the fraction of wrong labels
                        compared to the total number of labels. Scores  closer
                        to zero are better.

              DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the IAM role that grants
                 Amazon Comprehend read access to your input data.

              VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                 ID for the Amazon Web Services Key Management  Service  (KMS)
                 key  that Amazon Comprehend uses to encrypt data on the stor-
                 age volume  attached  to  the  ML  compute  instance(s)  that
                 process the analysis job. The VolumeKmsKeyId can be either of
                 the following formats:

                 o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                 o Amazon   Resource   Name    (ARN)    of    a    KMS    Key:
                   "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

              VpcConfig -> (structure)
                 Configuration parameters for a private Virtual Private  Cloud
                 (VPC)  containing the resources you are using for your custom
                 classifier. For more information, see Amazon VPC .

                 SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                     The ID number for a security group on an instance of your
                     private  VPC.  Security groups on your VPC function serve
                     as a virtual firewall to  control  inbound  and  outbound
                     traffic  and  provides  security  for  the resources that
                     youll be accessing on the VPC. This ID number is preceded
                     by  "sg-", for instance: "sg-03b388029b0a285ea". For more
                     information, see Security Groups for your VPC .

                     (string)

                 Subnets -> (list)
                     The ID for each subnet being used in  your  private  VPC.
                     This  subnet is a subset of the a range of IPv4 addresses

                     zone  in  the  VPCs Region. This ID number is preceded by
                     "subnet-", for instance: "subnet-04ccf456919e69055".  For
                     more information, see VPCs and Subnets .

                     (string)

              Mode -> (string)
                 Indicates  the  mode  in  which  the  specific classifier was
                 trained. This also indicates the format  of  input  documents
