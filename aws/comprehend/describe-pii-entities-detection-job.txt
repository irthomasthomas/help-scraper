OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The identifier that Amazon Comprehend generated for the job. The op-
          eration returns this identifier in its response.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       PiiEntitiesDetectionJobProperties -> (structure)
          Provides information about a PII entities detection job.

          JobId -> (string)
              The identifier assigned to the PII entities detection job.

          JobArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  PII  entities  detection
              job.  It is a unique, fully qualified identifier for the job. It
              includes the AWS account, Region, and the job ID. The format  of
              the ARN is as follows:
                 arn:<partition>:comprehend:<region>:<account-id>:pii-enti-
                 ties-detection-job/<job-id>

              The following is an example job ARN:
                 arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:pii-entities-detec-
                 tion-job/1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab

          JobName -> (string)
              The name that you assigned the PII entities detection job.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              The  current  status  of  the PII entities detection job. If the
              status is FAILED , the Message field shows the  reason  for  the
              failure.

          Message -> (string)
              A description of the status of a job.

          SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
              The  time  that the PII entities detection job was submitted for
              processing.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the PII entities detection job completed.

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The input properties for a PII entities detection job.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must be in same
                 region  as the API endpoint that you are calling. The URI can
                 point to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for
                 a collection of data files.

                 For  example,  if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix , if
                 the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file
                 as  input. If more than one file begins with the prefix, Ama-
                 zon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

              InputFormat -> (string)
                 Specifies how the text in an input file should be processed:

                 o ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is considered a separate docu-
                   ment.  Use  this option when you are processing large docu-
                   ments, such as newspaper articles or scientific papers.

                 o ONE_DOC_PER_LINE - Each line in a file is considered a sep-
                   arate  document.  Use  this  option when you are processing
                   many short documents, such as text messages.

              DocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)
                 Provides configuration parameters to override the default ac-
                 tions for extracting text from PDF documents and image files.

                 DocumentReadAction -> (string)
                     This field defines the Amazon Textract API operation that
                     Amazon Comprehend uses to extract text from PDF files and
                     image files. Enter one of the following values:

                     o TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT  -  The Amazon Comprehend
                       service uses the DetectDocumentText API operation.

                     o TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT - The Amazon Comprehend  ser-
                       vice uses the AnalyzeDocument API operation.

                 DocumentReadMode -> (string)
                     Determines the text extraction actions for PDF files. En-
                     ter one of the following values:

                     o SERVICE_DEFAULT - use the Amazon Comprehend service de-
                       faults for PDF files.

                     o FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION - Amazon Comprehend uses the
                       Textract API specified by  DocumentReadAction  for  all
                       PDF files, including digital PDF files.

                 FeatureTypes -> (list)
                     Specifies  the type of Amazon Textract features to apply.
                     If you chose TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT as  the  read  ac-
                     tion,  you must specify one or both of the following val-
                     ues:

                     o TABLES - Returns information about any tables that  are
                       detected in the input document.

                     o FORMS - Returns information and the data from any forms
                       that are detected in the input document.

                        ply.  If  you  chose  TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT as the
                        read action, you must specify one or both of the  fol-
                        lowing values:

                        o TABLES  -  Returns  additional information about any
                          tables that are detected in the input document.

                 When you use the PiiOutputDataConfig object with asynchronous
                 operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where you want
                 to write the output data.

                 For a PII entity detection job,  the  output  file  is  plain
                 text,  not  a compressed archive. The output file name is the
                 same as the input file, with .out appended at the end.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 ID for the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key  that  Amazon
                 Comprehend  uses to encrypt the output results from an analy-
                 sis job.

          RedactionConfig -> (structure)
              Provides configuration parameters for PII entity redaction.

              This parameter is required if you  set  the  Mode  parameter  to
              ONLY_REDACTION  . In that case, you must provide a RedactionCon-
              fig definition that includes the PiiEntityTypes parameter.

              PiiEntityTypes -> (list)
                 An array of the types of PII entities that Amazon  Comprehend
                 detects in the input text for your request.

                 (string)

              MaskMode -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether  the  PII entity is redacted with the mask
                 character or the entity type.

              MaskCharacter -> (string)
                 A character that replaces each character in the redacted  PII
                 entity.

          LanguageCode -> (string)
              The language code of the input documents

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that gives Amazon Comprehend read
              access to your input data.

          Mode -> (string)
              Specifies whether the output provides the locations (offsets) of
              PII entities or a file in which PII entities are redacted.
