OPTIONS
       --text-list (list)
          A list containing the text of the input documents. The list can con-
          tain a maximum of 25 documents. Each  document  must  contain  fewer
          that 5,000 bytes of UTF-8 encoded characters.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --language-code (string)
          The language of the input documents. You can specify any of the fol-
          lowing languages supported by Amazon Comprehend: German ("de"), Eng-
          lish  ("en"), Spanish ("es"), French ("fr"), Italian ("it"), or Por-
          tuguese ("pt"). All documents must be in the same language.

          Possible values:

          o en

          o es

          o fr

          o de

          o it

          o pt

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ResultList -> (list)
          A  list  of objects containing the results of the operation. The re-
          sults are sorted in ascending order by the Index field and match the
          order  of  the  documents in the input list. If all of the documents
          contain an error, the ResultList is empty.

          (structure)
              The result of calling the operation. The operation  returns  one
              object that is successfully processed by the operation.

              Index -> (integer)
                 The zero-based index of the document in the input list.

              SyntaxTokens -> (list)
                 The  syntax  tokens  for the words in the document, one token
                 for each word.

                 (structure)
                     Represents a work in the input text that  was  recognized
                     and  assigned a part of speech. There is one syntax token
                     record for each word in the source text.

                     TokenId -> (integer)
                        A unique identifier for a token.

                     Text -> (string)
                        The word that was recognized in the source text.

                     BeginOffset -> (integer)
                        The zero-based offset from the beginning of the source
                        text to the first character in the word.

                     EndOffset -> (integer)
                        The zero-based offset from the beginning of the source
                        text to the last character in the word.

                     PartOfSpeech -> (structure)
                        Provides the part of speech label and  the  confidence
                        level  that  Amazon  Comprehend  has  that the part of
                        speech was correctly identified. For more information,
                        see  how-syntax .

                        Tag -> (string)
                            Identifies  the part of speech that the token rep-
                            resents.

                        Score -> (float)
                            The confidence that Amazon Comprehend has that the
                            part of speech was correctly identified.

       ErrorList -> (list)
          A list containing one object for each document that contained an er-
          ror. The results are sorted in ascending order by  the  Index  field
          and match the order of the documents in the input list. If there are
          no errors in the batch, the ErrorList is empty.

          (structure)
              Describes an error that occurred while processing a document  in
              a batch. The operation returns on BatchItemError object for each
              document that contained an error.

              Index -> (integer)
                 The zero-based index of the document in the input list.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The numeric error code of the error.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 A text description of the error.
