NAME
       list-dominant-language-detection-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a list of the dominant language detection jobs that you have sub-
       mitted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-dominant-language-detection-jobs is a paginated operation.  Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  ar-
       gument.   When  using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: DominantLanguageDetectionJobProper-
       tiesList

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Filters that jobs that are returned. You can filter  jobs  on  their
          name, status, or the date and time that they were submitted. You can
          only set one filter at a time.

          JobName -> (string)
              Filters on the name of the job.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              Filters the list of jobs based on job status. Returns only  jobs
              with the specified status.

          SubmitTimeBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted for processing. Returns only jobs  submitted  before  the
              specified  time. Jobs are returned in ascending order, oldest to
              newest.

          SubmitTimeAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted  for  processing.  Returns  only jobs submitted after the
              specified time. Jobs are returned in descending order, newest to
              oldest.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          JobName=string,JobStatus=string,SubmitTimeBefore=timestamp,SubmitTimeAfter=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "JobName": "string",
            "JobStatus": "SUBMITTED"|"IN_PROGRESS"|"COMPLETED"|"FAILED"|"STOP_REQUESTED"|"STOPPED",
            "SubmitTimeBefore": timestamp,
            "SubmitTimeAfter": timestamp
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

          (structure)
              Provides information about a dominant language detection job.

              JobId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  assigned  to the dominant language detection
                 job.

              JobArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dominant  language  de-
                 tection  job.  It is a unique, fully qualified identifier for
                 the job. It includes the Amazon Web Services account,  Amazon
                 Web Services Region, and the job ID. The format of the ARN is
                 as follows:
                     arn:<partition>:comprehend:<region>:<account-id>:domi-
                     nant-language-detection-job/<job-id>

                 The following is an example job ARN:
                     arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:dominant-lan-
                     guage-detection-job/1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab

              JobName -> (string)
                 The name that you assigned to the dominant language detection
                 job.

              JobStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of the dominant language detection job. If
                 the status is FAILED , the Message field shows the reason for
                 the failure.

              Message -> (string)
                 A description for the status of a job.

              SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the dominant language detection job was submit-
                 ted for processing.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the dominant language detection job completed.

              InputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The input data configuration that you supplied when you  cre-
                 ated the dominant language detection job.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     The  Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must be in
                     same Region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The
                     URI  can  point  to a single input file or it can provide
                     the prefix for a collection of data files.

                     For example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix  ,
                     if  the  prefix  is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses
                     that file as input. If more than one file begins with the
                     prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

                 InputFormat -> (string)
                     Specifies  how  the  text in an input file should be pro-
                     cessed:

                     o ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is considered  a  separate
                       document. Use this option when you are processing large
                       documents, such as newspaper articles or scientific pa-
                       pers.

                     o ONE_DOC_PER_LINE  - Each line in a file is considered a
                       separate document. Use this option when  you  are  pro-
                       cessing many short documents, such as text messages.

                 DocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)
                     Provides configuration parameters to override the default
                     actions for extracting text from PDF documents and  image
                     files.

                     DocumentReadAction -> (string)
                        This  field  defines the Amazon Textract API operation
                        that Amazon Comprehend uses to extract text  from  PDF
                        files and image files. Enter one of the following val-
                        ues:

                        o TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT - The  Amazon  Compre-
                          hend  service uses the DetectDocumentText API opera-
                          tion.

                        o TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT -  The  Amazon  Comprehend
                          service uses the AnalyzeDocument API operation.

                     DocumentReadMode -> (string)
                        Determines  the text extraction actions for PDF files.
                        Enter one of the following values:

                        o SERVICE_DEFAULT - use the Amazon Comprehend  service
                          defaults for PDF files.

                        o FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION  - Amazon Comprehend uses
                          the Textract API specified by DocumentReadAction for
                          all PDF files, including digital PDF files.

                     FeatureTypes -> (list)
                        Specifies  the type of Amazon Textract features to ap-
                        ply. If you  chose  TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT  as  the
                        read  action, you must specify one or both of the fol-
                        lowing values:

                        o TABLES - Returns information about any  tables  that
                          are detected in the input document.

                        o FORMS  -  Returns  information and the data from any
                          forms that are detected in the input document.

                        (string)
                            Specifies the type of Amazon Textract features  to
                            apply.  If  you chose TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT as
                            the read action, you must specify one or  both  of
                            the following values:

                            o TABLES  -  Returns  additional information about
                              any tables that are detected in the input  docu-
                              ment.

                            o FORMS - Returns additional information about any
                              forms that are detected in the input document.

              OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The output data configuration that you supplied when you cre-
                 ated the dominant language detection job.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     When  you  use the OutputDataConfig object with asynchro-
                     nous operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where
                     you want to write the output data. The URI must be in the
                     same Region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The
                     location is used as the prefix for the actual location of
                     the output file.

                     When the topic detection job  is  finished,  the  service
                     creates  an  output  file  in a directory specific to the
                     job. The S3Uri field contains the location of the  output
                     file,  called  output.tar.gz . It is a compressed archive
                     that contains the ouput of the operation.

                     For a PII entity detection job, the output file is  plain
                     text,  not  a compressed archive. The output file name is
                     the same as the input file, with  .out  appended  at  the
                     end.
