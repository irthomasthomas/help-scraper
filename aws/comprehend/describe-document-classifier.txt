          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --document-classifier-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the document classi-
          fier. The CreateDocumentClassifier operation returns this identifier
          in its response.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       DocumentClassifierProperties -> (structure)
          An  object  that  contains the properties associated with a document
          classifier.

          DocumentClassifierArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  that  identifies  the  document
              classifier.

          LanguageCode -> (string)
              The  language  code  for  the language of the documents that the
              classifier was trained on.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the document classifier. If the status is  TRAINED
              the   classifier   is   ready   to   use.   If   the  status  is
              TRAINED_WITH_WARNINGS the classifier training succeeded, but you
              should review the warnings returned in the CreateDocumentClassi-
              fier response.

              If the status is FAILED you can see additional information about
              why the classifier wasn't trained in the Message field.

          Message -> (string)
              Additional information about the status of the classifier.

          SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
              The  time  that the document classifier was submitted for train-
              ing.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that training the document classifier completed.

          TrainingStartTime -> (timestamp)
              Indicates the time when the  training  starts  on  documentation
              classifiers.  You  are billed for the time interval between this
              time and the value of TrainingEndTime.

          TrainingEndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that training of the document classifier was completed.
              Indicates  the time when the training completes on documentation
              classifiers. You are billed for the time interval  between  this
              time and the value of TrainingStartTime.

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The  input data configuration that you supplied when you created
              the document classifier for training.

              DataFormat -> (string)
                 The format of your training data:

                 o COMPREHEND_CSV : A two-column CSV file,  where  labels  are
                   provided in the first column, and documents are provided in
                   the second. If you use this value,  you  must  provide  the
                   S3Uri parameter in your request.

                 o AUGMENTED_MANIFEST  : A labeled dataset that is produced by
                   Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. This file is in  JSON  lines
                   format. Each line is a complete JSON object that contains a
                   training document and its associated labels.   If  you  use
                   this value, you must provide the AugmentedManifests parame-
                   ter in your request.

                 If you don't specify a value, Amazon Comprehend uses  COMPRE-
                 HEND_CSV as the default.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  S3 URI for the input data. The S3 bucket must be
                 in the same Region as the API endpoint that you are  calling.
                 The  URI  can  point to a single input file or it can provide
                 the prefix for a collection of input files.

                 For example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix  ,  if
                 the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file
                 as input. If more than one file begins with the prefix,  Ama-
                 zon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

                 This  parameter  is required if you set DataFormat to COMPRE-
                 HEND_CSV .

              TestS3Uri -> (string)
                 This specifies the Amazon S3 location where the test  annota-
                 tions  for  an entity recognizer are located. The URI must be
                 in the same Amazon Web Services Region as  the  API  endpoint
                 that you are calling.

              LabelDelimiter -> (string)
                 Indicates  the  delimiter  used  to  separate  each label for
                 training a multi-label classifier. The default delimiter  be-
                 tween labels is a pipe (|). You can use a different character
                 as a delimiter (if it's an allowed character)  by  specifying
                 it  under Delimiter for labels. If the training documents use
                 a delimiter other than the default or the delimiter you spec-
                 ify,  the labels on that line will be combined to make a sin-
                 gle unique label, such as LABELLABELLABEL.

              AugmentedManifests -> (list)
                 A list of augmented manifest files that provide training data
                 for  your  custom  model. An augmented manifest file is a la-
                 beled dataset that is produced  by  Amazon  SageMaker  Ground
                 Truth.

                 This  parameter  is  required  if  you set DataFormat to AUG-
                 MENTED_MANIFEST .

                 (structure)
                     An augmented manifest file that  provides  training  data
                     for  your  custom  model. An augmented manifest file is a
                     labeled dataset that  is  produced  by  Amazon  SageMaker
                     Ground Truth.

                     S3Uri -> (string)
                        The Amazon S3 location of the augmented manifest file.

                     Split -> (string)
                        The  purpose  of  the data you've provided in the aug-
                        mented manifest. You can either  train  or  test  this
                        data. If you don't specify, the default is train.

                        TRAIN  -  all of the documents in the manifest will be
                        used for training. If no test documents are  provided,
                        Amazon Comprehend will automatically reserve a portion
                        of the training documents for testing.

                        TEST - all of the documents in the  manifest  will  be
                        used for testing.

                     AttributeNames -> (list)
                        The  JSON  attribute that contains the annotations for
                        your training documents. The number of attribute names
                        that  you  specify  depends  on whether your augmented
                        manifest file is the output of a single  labeling  job
                        or a chained labeling job.

                        If  your  file is the output of a single labeling job,
                        specify the LabelAttributeName key that was used  when
                        the job was created in Ground Truth.

                        If  your file is the output of a chained labeling job,
                        specify the LabelAttributeName key  for  one  or  more
                        jobs  in  the  chain. Each LabelAttributeName key pro-
                        vides the annotations from an individual job.

                        (string)

                     AnnotationDataS3Uri -> (string)
                        The S3 prefix to the annotation  files  that  are  re-
                        ferred in the augmented manifest file.

                     SourceDocumentsS3Uri -> (string)
                        The  S3 prefix to the source files (PDFs) that are re-
                        ferred to in the augmented manifest file.

                     DocumentType -> (string)
                        The type of augmented manifest.  PlainTextDocument  or
                        SemiStructuredDocument.  If you don't specify, the de-
                        fault is PlainTextDocument.

                        o PLAIN_TEXT_DOCUMENT A document type that  represents
                          any unicode text that is encoded in UTF-8.

                        o SEMI_STRUCTURED_DOCUMENT  A document type with posi-
                          tional and  structural  context,  like  a  PDF.  For
                          training  with Amazon Comprehend, only PDFs are sup-
                          ported. For  inference,  Amazon  Comprehend  support
                          PDFs, DOCX and TXT.

              DocumentType -> (string)
                 The  type  of input documents for training the model. Provide
                 plain-text documents to create a plain-text model,  and  pro-
                 vide semi-structured documents to create a native model.

              Documents -> (structure)
                 The  S3 location of the training documents. This parameter is
                 required in a request to create a native classifier model.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     The S3 URI location of the training  documents  specified
                     in the S3Uri CSV file.

                 TestS3Uri -> (string)
                     The S3 URI location of the test documents included in the
                     TestS3Uri CSV file. This field is not required if you  do
                     not specify a test CSV file.

              DocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)
                 Provides configuration parameters to override the default ac-
                 tions for extracting text from PDF documents and image files.

                 By default, Amazon Comprehend performs the following  actions
                 to extract text from files, based on the input file type:

                 o Word files - Amazon Comprehend parser extracts the text.

                 o Digital  PDF  files - Amazon Comprehend parser extracts the
                   text.

                 o Image files and scanned PDF files - Amazon Comprehend  uses
                   the  Amazon  Textract DetectDocumentText API to extract the
                   text.
                     DocumentReaderConfig does not apply to plain  text  files
                     or Word files.

                 For image files and PDF documents, you can override these de-
                 fault actions using the fields listed below. For more  infor-
                 mation, see Setting text extraction options in the Comprehend
                 Developer Guide.

                 DocumentReadAction -> (string)
                     This field defines the Amazon Textract API operation that
                     Amazon Comprehend uses to extract text from PDF files and
                     image files. Enter one of the following values:

                     o TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT - The  Amazon  Comprehend
                       service uses the DetectDocumentText API operation.

                     o TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT  - The Amazon Comprehend ser-
                       vice uses the AnalyzeDocument API operation.

                 DocumentReadMode -> (string)
                     Determines the text extraction actions for PDF files. En-
                     ter one of the following values:

                     o SERVICE_DEFAULT - use the Amazon Comprehend service de-
                       faults for PDF files.

                     o FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION - Amazon Comprehend uses the
                       Textract  API  specified  by DocumentReadAction for all
                       PDF files, including digital PDF files.

                 FeatureTypes -> (list)
                     Specifies the type of Amazon Textract features to  apply.
                     If  you  chose  TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT as the read ac-
                     tion, you must specify one or both of the following  val-
                     ues:

                       detected in the input document.

                     o FORMS - Returns information and the data from any forms
                       that are detected in the input document.

                     (string)
                        Specifies  the type of Amazon Textract features to ap-
                        ply. If you  chose  TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT  as  the
                        read  action, you must specify one or both of the fol-
                        lowing values:

                        o TABLES - Returns additional  information  about  any
                          tables that are detected in the input document.

                        o FORMS  -  Returns  additional  information about any
                          forms that are detected in the input document.

          OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
              Provides output  results  configuration  parameters  for  custom
              classifier jobs.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 When  you  use  the  OutputDataConfig object while creating a
                 custom classifier, you specify the Amazon S3  location  where
                 you  want  to  write  the  confusion  matrix and other output
                 files. The URI must be in the same Region as the API endpoint
                 that  you are calling. The location is used as the prefix for
                 the actual location of this output file.

                 When the custom classifier job is finished, the service  cre-
                 ates  the output file in a directory specific to the job. The
                 S3Uri field contains the location of the output file,  called
                 output.tar.gz  . It is a compressed archive that contains the
                 confusion matrix.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 ID for the Amazon Web Services Key Management  Service  (KMS)
                 key that Amazon Comprehend uses to encrypt the output results
                 from an analysis job. The KmsKeyId can be one of the  follow-
                 ing formats:

                 o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                 o Amazon    Resource    Name    (ARN)    of    a   KMS   Key:
                   "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                 o KMS Key Alias: "alias/ExampleAlias"

                 o ARN         of        a        KMS        Key        Alias:
                   "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias"

                 wheel statistics.

          ClassifierMetadata -> (structure)
              Information  about the document classifier, including the number
              of documents used for training the  classifier,  the  number  of
              documents used for test the classifier, and an accuracy rating.

              NumberOfLabels -> (integer)
                 The number of labels in the input data.

              NumberOfTrainedDocuments -> (integer)
                 The  number  of documents in the input data that were used to
                 train the classifier. Typically this is 80 to 90  percent  of
                 the input documents.

              NumberOfTestDocuments -> (integer)
                 The  number  of documents in the input data that were used to
                 test the classifier. Typically this is 10 to  20  percent  of
                 the input documents, up to 10,000 documents.

              EvaluationMetrics -> (structure)
                 Describes  the  result  metrics  for the test data associated
                 with an documentation classifier.

                 Accuracy -> (double)
                     The fraction of the labels that were correct  recognized.
                     It  is  computed  by dividing the number of labels in the
                     test documents that were correctly recognized by the  to-
                     tal number of labels in the test documents.

                 Precision -> (double)
                     A  measure of the usefulness of the classifier results in
                     the test data. High precision means that  the  classifier
                     returned substantially more relevant results than irrele-
                     vant ones.

                 Recall -> (double)
                     A measure of how complete the classifier results are  for
                     the  test data. High recall means that the classifier re-
                     turned most of the relevant results.

                 F1Score -> (double)
                     A measure of how accurate the classifier results are  for
                     the  test  data. It is derived from the Precision and Re-
                     call values. The F1Score is the harmonic average  of  the
                     two  scores.  The highest score is 1, and the worst score
                     is 0.

                 MicroPrecision -> (double)
                     A measure of the usefulness of the recognizer results  in
                     the  test  data. High precision means that the recognizer
                     returned substantially more relevant results than irrele-
                     vant  ones.  Unlike the Precision metric which comes from
                     averaging the precision of all available labels, this  is
                     based  on the overall score of all precision scores added
                     together.

                 MicroRecall -> (double)
                     A measure of how complete the classifier results are  for
                     the  test data. High recall means that the classifier re-
                     turned most of the relevant results.  Specifically,  this
                     indicates  how many of the correct categories in the text
                     that the model can predict. It is a percentage of correct
                     categories in the text that can found. Instead of averag-
                     ing the recall scores of all labels (as with Recall), mi-
                     cro  Recall  is  based on the overall score of all recall
                     scores added together.

                 MicroF1Score -> (double)
                     A measure of how accurate the classifier results are  for
                     the test data. It is a combination of the Micro Precision
                     and Micro Recall values. The Micro F1Score  is  the  har-
                     monic mean of the two scores. The highest score is 1, and
                     the worst score is 0.

                 HammingLoss -> (double)
                     Indicates the fraction of  labels  that  are  incorrectly
                     predicted. Also seen as the fraction of wrong labels com-
                     pared to the total number of  labels.  Scores  closer  to
                     zero are better.

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that grants Ama-
              zon Comprehend read access to your input data.

              ID for the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS)  key
              that  Amazon Comprehend uses to encrypt data on the storage vol-
              ume attached to the ML  compute  instance(s)  that  process  the
              analysis  job. The VolumeKmsKeyId can be either of the following
              formats:

              o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

              o Amazon    Resource    Name    (ARN)    of    a    KMS     Key:
                "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

              (VPC)  containing  the  resources  you are using for your custom
              classifier. For more information, see Amazon VPC .

              SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                 The ID number for a security group on  an  instance  of  your
                 private  VPC. Security groups on your VPC function serve as a
                 virtual firewall to control inbound and outbound traffic  and
                 provides  security  for the resources that youll be accessing
                 on the VPC. This ID number is  preceded  by  "sg-",  for  in-
                 stance:  "sg-03b388029b0a285ea".  For  more  information, see
                 Security Groups for your VPC .

                 (string)

              Subnets -> (list)
                 The ID for each subnet being used in your private  VPC.  This
                 subnet  is  a subset of the a range of IPv4 addresses used by
                 the VPC and is specific to a given availability zone  in  the
                 VPCs Region. This ID number is preceded by "subnet-", for in-
                 stance: "subnet-04ccf456919e69055". For more information, see
                 VPCs and Subnets .

                 (string)

          Mode -> (string)
              Indicates the mode in which the specific classifier was trained.
              This also indicates the format of input documents and the format
              of  the confusion matrix. Each classifier can only be trained in
              one mode and this cannot  be  changed  once  the  classifier  is
              trained.

          ModelKmsKeyId -> (string)
              ID  for  the  KMS  key  that  Amazon  Comprehend uses to encrypt
