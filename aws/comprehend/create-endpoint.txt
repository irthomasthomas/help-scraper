OPTIONS
       --endpoint-name (string)
          This  is the descriptive suffix that becomes part of the EndpointArn
          used for all subsequent requests to this resource.

       --model-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the model to which the  endpoint
          will be attached.

       --desired-inference-units (integer)
          The  desired number of inference units to be used by the model using
          this endpoint. Each inference unit represents of a throughput of 100
          characters per second.

       --client-request-token (string)
          An idempotency token provided by the customer. If this token matches
          a previous endpoint creation request, Amazon Comprehend will not re-
          turn a ResourceInUseException .

       --tags (list)
          Tags  to associate with the endpoint. A tag is a key-value pair that
          adds metadata to the endpoint. For example, a tag  with  "Sales"  as
          the  key  might  be  added to an endpoint to indicate its use by the
          sales department.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair that adds as a metadata to a resource  used  by
              Amazon  Comprehend.  For  example, a tag with the key-value pair
              Department:Sales might be added to a resource  to  indicate  its
              use by a particular department.

              Key -> (string)
                 The initial part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show
                 which  resources are used by which departments, you might use
                 Department as the key portion of the pair, with multiple pos-
                 sible values such as sales, legal, and administration.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  second part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show
                 which  resources are used by which departments, you might use
                 Department as the initial (key) portion of the pair,  with  a
                 value of sales to indicate the sales department.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --data-access-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the IAM role that grants Amazon
          Comprehend read access to trained custom  models  encrypted  with  a
          customer managed key (ModelKmsKeyId).

       --flywheel-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Number (ARN) of the flywheel to which the end-
          point will be attached.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an endpoint for a custom model

       The following create-endpoint example creates an endpoint for  synchro-
       nous inference for a previously trained custom model.

          aws comprehend create-endpoint \
              --endpoint-name example-classifier-endpoint-1 \
              --model-arn arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:document-classifier/example-classifier \
              --desired-inference-units 1

       Output:

          {
              "EndpointArn": "arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:document-classifier-endpoint/example-classifier-endpoint-1"
          }

       For  more  information, see Managing Amazon Comprehend endpoints in the
       Amazon Comprehend Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       EndpointArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the endpoint being created.

       ModelArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the model to which the  endpoint
          is attached.
