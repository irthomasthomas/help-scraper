LIST-ENDPOINTS()                                              LIST-ENDPOINTS()



NAME
       list-endpoints -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of all existing endpoints that you've created. For informa-
       tion about endpoints, see Managing endpoints .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-endpoints is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: EndpointPropertiesList

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Filters the endpoints that are returned. You can filter endpoints on
          their name, model, status, or the date and time that they were  cre-
          ated. You can only set one filter at a time.

          ModelArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the model to which the end-
              point is attached.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the status of the endpoint  being  returned.  Possible
              values are: Creating, Ready, Updating, Deleting, Failed.

          CreationTimeBefore -> (timestamp)
              Specifies a date before which the returned endpoint or endpoints
              were created.

          CreationTimeAfter -> (timestamp)
              Specifies a date after which the returned endpoint or  endpoints
              were created.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ModelArn=string,Status=string,CreationTimeBefore=timestamp,CreationTimeAfter=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ModelArn": "string",
            "Status": "CREATING"|"DELETING"|"FAILED"|"IN_SERVICE"|"UPDATING",
            "CreationTimeBefore": timestamp,
            "CreationTimeAfter": timestamp
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       EndpointPropertiesList -> (list)
          Displays  a  list of endpoint properties being retrieved by the ser-
          vice in response to the request.

          (structure)
              Specifies information about the specified endpoint. For informa-
              tion about endpoints, see Managing endpoints .

              EndpointArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the endpoint.

              Status -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  status  of the endpoint. Because the endpoint
                 updates and creation are asynchronous, so customers will need
                 to wait for the endpoint to be Ready status before making in-
                 ference requests.

              Message -> (string)
                 Specifies a reason for failure in cases of Failed status.

              ModelArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the model  to  which  the
                 endpoint is attached.

              DesiredModelArn -> (string)
                 ARN  of  the  new  model to use for updating an existing end-
                 point. This ARN is going to be different from the  model  ARN
                 when the update is in progress

              DesiredInferenceUnits -> (integer)
                 The desired number of inference units to be used by the model
                 using this endpoint. Each  inference  unit  represents  of  a
                 throughput of 100 characters per second.

              CurrentInferenceUnits -> (integer)
                 The number of inference units currently used by the model us-
                 ing this endpoint.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The creation date and time of the endpoint.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the endpoint was last modified.

              DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access
                 Management  (IAM) role that grants Amazon Comprehend read ac-
                 cess to trained custom models encrypted with a customer  man-
                 aged key (ModelKmsKeyId).

              DesiredDataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 Data  access  role  ARN  to  use in case the new model is en-
                 crypted with a customer KMS key.

              FlywheelArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the flywheel

       NextToken -> (string)
          Identifies the next page of results to return.
