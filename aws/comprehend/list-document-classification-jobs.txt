NAME
       list-document-classification-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of the documentation classification jobs that you have sub-
       mitted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-document-classification-jobs is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the  following  query expressions: DocumentClassificationJobProperties-
       List

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Filters the jobs that are returned. You can  filter  jobs  on  their
          names,  status,  or  the date and time that they were submitted. You
          can only set one filter at a time.

          JobName -> (string)
              Filters on the name of the job.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              Filters the list based on job status. Returns only jobs with the
              specified status.

          SubmitTimeBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted for processing. Returns only jobs  submitted  before  the
              specified  time. Jobs are returned in ascending order, oldest to
              newest.

          SubmitTimeAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted  for  processing.  Returns  only jobs submitted after the
              specified time. Jobs are returned in descending order, newest to
              oldest.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          JobName=string,JobStatus=string,SubmitTimeBefore=timestamp,SubmitTimeAfter=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "JobName": "string",
            "JobStatus": "SUBMITTED"|"IN_PROGRESS"|"COMPLETED"|"FAILED"|"STOP_REQUESTED"|"STOPPED",
            "SubmitTimeBefore": timestamp,
            "SubmitTimeAfter": timestamp
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       DocumentClassificationJobPropertiesList -> (list)
          A list containing the properties of each job returned.

          (structure)

              JobId -> (string)
                 The identifier assigned to the document classification job.

              JobArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the document classification
                 job. It is a unique, fully qualified identifier for the  job.
                 It includes the AWS account, Region, and the job ID. The for-
                 mat of the ARN is as follows:
                     arn:<partition>:comprehend:<region>:<account-id>:docu-
                     ment-classification-job/<job-id>

                 The following is an example job ARN:
                     arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:document-clas-
                     sification-job/1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab

              JobName -> (string)
                 The name that you assigned  to  the  document  classification
                 job.

              JobStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of the document classification job. If the
                 status is FAILED , the Message field shows the reason for the
                 failure.

              Message -> (string)
                 A description of the status of the job.

              SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  that the document classification job was submitted
                 for processing.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the document classification job completed.

              DocumentClassifierArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies  the  document
                 classifier.

              InputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The  input data configuration that you supplied when you cre-
                 ated the document classification job.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must be  in
                     same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The
                     URI can point to a single input file or  it  can  provide
                     the prefix for a collection of data files.

                     For  example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix ,
                     if the prefix is a single file,  Amazon  Comprehend  uses
                     that file as input. If more than one file begins with the
                     prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

                 InputFormat -> (string)
                     Specifies how the text in an input file  should  be  pro-
                     cessed:

                     o ONE_DOC_PER_FILE  -  Each file is considered a separate
                       document. Use this option when you are processing large
                       documents, such as newspaper articles or scientific pa-
                       pers.

                     o ONE_DOC_PER_LINE - Each line in a file is considered  a
                       separate  document.  Use  this option when you are pro-
                       cessing many short documents, such as text messages.

                 DocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)
                     The document reader config field applies only for  Input-
                     DataConfig of StartEntitiesDetectionJob.

                     Use  DocumentReaderConfig to provide specifications about
                     how you want your inference documents read. Currently  it
                     applies  for  PDF  documents in StartEntitiesDetectionJob
                     custom inference.

                     DocumentReadAction -> (string)
                        This enum field will start with two values which  will
                        apply to PDFs:

                        o TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT  -  The  service calls
                          DetectDocumentText for PDF documents per page.

                        o TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT - The service  calls  Ana-
                          lyzeDocument for PDF documents per page.

                     DocumentReadMode -> (string)
                        This enum field provides two values:

                        o SERVICE_DEFAULT  - use service defaults for Document
                          reading. For Digital PDF it would mean using an  in-
                          ternal parser instead of Textract APIs

                        o FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION  -  Always  use specified
                          action  for  DocumentReadAction,  including  Digital
                          PDF.

                     FeatureTypes -> (list)
                        Specifies how the text in an input file should be pro-
                        cessed:

                        (string)
                            A list of the types of analyses to  perform.  This
                            field  specifies what feature types need to be ex-
                            tracted from the document where entity recognition
                            is expected.

                            o TABLES - Add TABLES to the list to return infor-
                              mation about the tables that are detected in the
                              input document.

                            o FORMS - Add FORMS to return detected form data.

              OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The output data configuration that you supplied when you cre-
                 ated the document classification job.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     When you use the OutputDataConfig object  with  asynchro-
                     nous operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where
                     you want to write the output data. The URI must be in the
                     same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The
                     location is used as the prefix for the actual location of
                     the output file.

                     When  the  topic  detection  job is finished, the service
                     creates an output file in a  directory  specific  to  the
                     job.  The S3Uri field contains the location of the output
                     file, called output.tar.gz . It is a  compressed  archive
                     that contains the ouput of the operation.

                     For  a PII entity detection job, the output file is plain
                     text, not a compressed archive. The output file  name  is
                     the  same  as  the  input file, with .out appended at the
                     end.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     ID for the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key that Ama-
                     zon Comprehend uses to encrypt the output results from an
                     analysis job. The KmsKeyId can be one  of  the  following
                     formats:

                     o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                     o Amazon    Resource   Name   (ARN)   of   a   KMS   Key:

              VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                 ID for the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key  that  Amazon
                 Comprehend  uses  to  encrypt  data on the storage volume at-
                 tached to the ML compute instance(s) that process the  analy-
                 sis  job.  The  VolumeKmsKeyId can be either of the following
                 formats:
