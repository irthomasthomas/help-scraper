NAME
       stop-targeted-sentiment-detection-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops a targeted sentiment detection job in progress.

       If the job state is IN_PROGRESS , the job is marked for termination and
       put into the STOP_REQUESTED state. If the job completes before  it  can
       be stopped, it is put into the COMPLETED state; otherwise the job is be
       stopped and put into the STOPPED state.

       If the job is in the COMPLETED or FAILED state when you call the  Stop-
       DominantLanguageDetectionJob operation, the operation returns a 400 In-
       ternal Request Exception.

       When a job is stopped, any documents already processed are  written  to
       the output location.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-targeted-sentiment-detection-job
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The identifier of the targeted sentiment detection job to stop.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
