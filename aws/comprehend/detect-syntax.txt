OPTIONS
       --text (string)
          A UTF-8 string. The maximum string size is 5 KB.

       --language-code (string)
          The language code of the input documents. You can specify any of the
          following languages supported by Amazon Comprehend:  German  ("de"),
          English  ("en"),  Spanish  ("es"), French ("fr"), Italian ("it"), or
          Portuguese ("pt").

          Possible values:

          o en

          o es

          o fr

          o de

          o it

          o pt

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       SyntaxTokens -> (list)
          A  collection  of syntax tokens describing the text. For each token,
          the response provides the text, the token type, where the  text  be-
          gins  and  ends,  and the level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend
          has that the token is correct. For a list of token types, see Syntax
          in the Comprehend Developer Guide.

          (structure)
              Represents  a work in the input text that was recognized and as-
              signed a part of speech. There is one syntax  token  record  for
              each word in the source text.

              TokenId -> (integer)
                 A unique identifier for a token.

              Text -> (string)
                 The word that was recognized in the source text.

              BeginOffset -> (integer)
                 The  zero-based  offset from the beginning of the source text
                 to the first character in the word.

              EndOffset -> (integer)
                 The zero-based offset from the beginning of the  source  text
                 to the last character in the word.

              PartOfSpeech -> (structure)
                 Provides  the  part  of speech label and the confidence level
                 that Amazon Comprehend has that the part of speech  was  cor-
                 rectly  identified.  For  more information, see Syntax in the
                 Comprehend Developer Guide.

                 Tag -> (string)
                     Identifies the part of speech that the token represents.

                 Score -> (float)
                     The confidence that Amazon Comprehend has that  the  part
                     of speech was correctly identified.
