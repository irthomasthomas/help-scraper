OPTIONS
       --text-list (list)
          A list containing the UTF-8 encoded text of the input documents. The
          list can contain a maximum of 25 documents. The maximum size of each
          document is 5 KB.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --language-code (string)
          The language of the input documents. You can specify any of the pri-
          mary languages supported by Amazon Comprehend. All documents must be
          in the same language.

          Possible values:

          o en

          o es

          o fr

          o de

          o it

          o pt

          o zh

          o zh-TW

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To detect the prevailing sentiment of multiple input texts

       The  following  batch-detect-sentiment  example analyzes multiple input
       texts and returns the prevailing sentiment (POSITIVE,  NEUTRAL,  MIXED,
       or NEGATIVE, of each one).

          aws comprehend batch-detect-sentiment \
              --text-list "That movie was very boring, I can't believe it was over four hours long." "It is a beautiful day for hiking today." "My meal was okay, I'm excited to try other restaurants." \
              --language-code en

OUTPUT
       ResultList -> (list)
          A list of objects containing the results of the operation.  The  re-
          sults are sorted in ascending order by the Index field and match the
          order of the documents in the input list. If all  of  the  documents
          contain an error, the ResultList is empty.

          (structure)
              The  result  of calling the operation. The operation returns one
              object for each document that is successfully processed  by  the
              operation.

              Index -> (integer)
                 The zero-based index of the document in the input list.

              Sentiment -> (string)
                 The sentiment detected in the document.

              SentimentScore -> (structure)
                 The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the ac-
                 curacy of its sentiment detection.

                 Positive -> (float)
                     The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the
                     accuracy of its detection of the POSITIVE sentiment.

                 Negative -> (float)
                     The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the
                     accuracy of its detection of the NEGATIVE sentiment.

                 Neutral -> (float)
                     The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the
                     accuracy of its detection of the NEUTRAL sentiment.

                 Mixed -> (float)
                     The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the
                     accuracy of its detection of the MIXED sentiment.

       ErrorList -> (list)
          A list containing one object for each document that contained an er-
          ror.  The  results  are sorted in ascending order by the Index field
          and match the order of the documents in the input list. If there are
          no errors in the batch, the ErrorList is empty.

          (structure)
              Describes  an error that occurred while processing a document in
              a batch. The operation returns on BatchItemError object for each
              document that contained an error.

              Index -> (integer)
                 The zero-based index of the document in the input list.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The numeric error code of the error.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 A text description of the error.
