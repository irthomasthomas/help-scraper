CREATE-FLYWHEEL()                                            CREATE-FLYWHEEL()



NAME
       create-flywheel -

DESCRIPTION
       A flywheel is an Amazon Web Services resource that orchestrates the on-
       going training of a model for custom classification  or  custom  entity
       recognition.  You  can  create  a  flywheel  to  start with an existing
       trained model, or Comprehend can create and train a new model.

       When you create the flywheel, Comprehend creates a data  lake  in  your
       account.  The  data  lake holds the training data and test data for all
       versions of the model.

       To use a flywheel with an existing trained model, you specify  the  ac-
       tive  model  version.  Comprehend  copies the model's training data and
       test data into the flywheel's data lake.

       To use the flywheel with a new model, you need to provide a dataset for
       training data (and optional test data) when you create the flywheel.

       For more information about flywheels, see Flywheel overview in the Ama-
       zon Comprehend Developer Guide .

          (structure)
              A key-value pair that adds as a metadata to a resource  used  by
              Amazon  Comprehend.  For  example, a tag with the key-value pair
              Department:Sales might be added to a resource  to  indicate  its
              use by a particular department.

              Key -> (string)
                 The initial part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show
                 which  resources are used by which departments, you might use
                 Department as the key portion of the pair, with multiple pos-
                 sible values such as sales, legal, and administration.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  second part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show
                 which  resources are used by which departments, you might use
                 Department as the initial (key) portion of the pair,  with  a
                 value of sales to indicate the sales department.

       Shorthand Syntax:

       JSON Syntax:

          [

              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       FlywheelArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the flywheel.

       ActiveModelArn -> (string)
