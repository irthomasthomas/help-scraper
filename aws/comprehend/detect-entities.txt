DETECT-ENTITIES()                                            DETECT-ENTITIES()



NAME
       detect-entities -

DESCRIPTION
       Detects  named  entities  in  input  text  when you use the pre-trained
       model. Detects custom entities if you have a custom entity  recognition
       model.

       When  detecting  named  entities using the pre-trained model, use plain
       text as the input. For  more  information  about  named  entities,  see
       Entities in the Comprehend Developer Guide.

       When  you  use  a  custom entity recognition model, you can input plain
       text or you can upload a single-page input document (text,  PDF,  Word,
       or image).

       If the system detects errors while processing a page in the input docu-
       ment, the API response includes an entry in Errors for each error.

       If the system detects a document-level error in  your  input  document,
       the  API returns an InvalidRequestException error response. For details
       about this exception, see Errors in semi-structured  documents  in  the
       Comprehend Developer Guide.

OPTIONS
       --text (string)
          A UTF-8 text string. The maximum string size is 100 KB. If you enter
          text using this parameter, do not use the Bytes parameter.

       --language-code (string)
          The language of the input documents. You can specify any of the pri-
          mary  languages  supported by Amazon Comprehend. If your request in-
          cludes the endpoint for a custom entity  recognition  model,  Amazon
          Comprehend  uses  the  language of your custom model, and it ignores
          any language code that you specify here.

          All input documents must be in the same language.

          Possible values:

          o en

          o es

          o fr

          o de

          o it

          o pt

          o ar

          o hi

          o ja

          o ko

          o zh

          o zh-TW

       --endpoint-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name of an endpoint that is  associated  with  a
          custom  entity recognition model. Provide an endpoint if you want to
          detect entities by using your own custom model instead  of  the  de-
          fault model that is used by Amazon Comprehend.

          If  you  specify an endpoint, Amazon Comprehend uses the language of
          your custom model, and it ignores any language code that you provide
          in your request.

          For information about endpoints, see Managing endpoints .

       --bytes (blob)
          This  field  applies  only  when you use a custom entity recognition
          model that was trained with PDF annotations. For other cases,  enter
          your text input in the Text field.

          Use  the  Bytes  parameter to input a text, PDF, Word or image file.
          Using a plain-text file in the Bytes parameter is equivelent to  us-
          ing  the Text parameter (the Entities field in the response is iden-
          tical).

          You can also use the Bytes parameter to input an Amazon Textract De-
          tectDocumentText or AnalyzeDocument output file.

          Provide the input document as a sequence of base64-encoded bytes. If
          your code uses an Amazon Web Services SDK to  detect  entities,  the
          SDK may encode the document file bytes for you.

          The maximum length of this field depends on the input document type.
          For details, see Inputs for real-time custom analysis in the Compre-
          hend Developer Guide.

          If you use the Bytes parameter, do not use the Text parameter.

       --document-reader-config (structure)
          Provides  configuration  parameters  to override the default actions
          for extracting text from PDF documents and image files.

          DocumentReadAction -> (string)
              This field defines the Amazon Textract API operation that Amazon
              Comprehend  uses to extract text from PDF files and image files.
              Enter one of the following values:

              o TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT - The Amazon Comprehend  service
                uses the DetectDocumentText API operation.

              o TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT - The Amazon Comprehend service uses
                the AnalyzeDocument API operation.

          DocumentReadMode -> (string)
              Determines the text extraction actions for PDF files. Enter  one
              of the following values:

              o SERVICE_DEFAULT  -  use the Amazon Comprehend service defaults
                for PDF files.

              o FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION - Amazon Comprehend uses  the  Tex-
                tract  API  specified by DocumentReadAction for all PDF files,
                including digital PDF files.

          FeatureTypes -> (list)
              Specifies the type of Amazon Textract features to apply. If  you
              chose  TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT  as  the  read action, you must
              specify one or both of the following values:

              o TABLES - Returns additional information about any tables  that
                are detected in the input document.

              o FORMS  -  Returns  additional information about any forms that
                are detected in the input document.

              (string)
                 TABLES or FORMS

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DocumentReadAction=string,DocumentReadMode=string,FeatureTypes=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DocumentReadAction": "TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT"|"TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT",
            "DocumentReadMode": "SERVICE_DEFAULT"|"FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION",
            "FeatureTypes": ["TABLES"|"FORMS", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To detect named entities in input text

       The  following  detect-entities example analyzes the input text and re-
       turns the named entities. The pre-trained model's confidence  score  is
       also output for each prediction.

OUTPUT
       Entities -> (list)
          A collection of entities identified in the input text. For each  en-
          tity,  the response provides the entity text, entity type, where the
          entity text begins and ends, and the level of confidence that Amazon
          Comprehend has in the detection.

          If  your request uses a custom entity recognition model, Amazon Com-
          prehend detects the entities that the model is trained to recognize.
          Otherwise,  it  detects  the default entity types. For a list of de-
          fault entity types, see Entities in the Comprehend Developer Guide.

          (structure)
              Provides information about an entity.

              Score -> (float)

                 curacy of the detection.

              Type -> (string)
                 The  entity  type.  For  entity  detection using the built-in
                 model, this field contains one of the standard  entity  types
                 listed below.

                 For  custom  entity detection, this field contains one of the
                 entity types that you specified when you trained your  custom
                 model.

              Text -> (string)
                 The text of the entity.

              BeginOffset -> (integer)

                 to the first character in the entity.

                 This field is empty for non-text input.

              EndOffset -> (integer)
                 The zero-based offset from the beginning of the  source  text
                 to the last character in the entity.

                 This field is empty for non-text input.

              BlockReferences -> (list)
