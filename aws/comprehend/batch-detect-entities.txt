OPTIONS
       --text-list (list)
          A list containing the UTF-8 encoded text of the input documents. The
          list can contain a maximum of 25 documents. The maximum size of each
          document is 5 KB.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --language-code (string)
          The language of the input documents. You can specify any of the pri-
          mary languages supported by Amazon Comprehend. All documents must be
          in the same language.

          Possible values:

          o en

          o es

          o fr

          o de

          o it

          o pt

          o ar

          o hi

          o ja

          o ko

          o zh

          o zh-TW

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To detect entities from multiple input texts

       The  following  batch-detect-entities  example  analyzes multiple input
       texts and returns the named entities of each. The  pre-trained  model's
       confidence score is also output for each prediction.

          aws comprehend batch-detect-entities \
              --language-code en \
              --text-list "Dear Jane, Your AnyCompany Financial Services LLC credit card account 1111-XXXX-1111-XXXX has a minimum payment of $24.53 that is due by July 31st." "Please send customer feedback to Sunshine Spa, 123 Main St, Anywhere or to Alice at AnySpa@example.com."

OUTPUT
       ResultList -> (list)
          A list of objects containing the results of the operation.  The  re-
          sults are sorted in ascending order by the Index field and match the
          order of the documents in the input list. If all  of  the  documents
          contain an error, the ResultList is empty.

          (structure)
              The  result  of calling the operation. The operation returns one
              object for each document that is successfully processed  by  the
              operation.

              Index -> (integer)
                 The zero-based index of the document in the input list.

              Entities -> (list)
                 One  or more  Entity objects, one for each entity detected in
                 the document.

                        The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has  in
                        the accuracy of the detection.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The  entity  type.  For  entity  detection  using  the
                        built-in model, this field contains one of  the  stan-
                        dard entity types listed below.

                        For  custom  entity detection, this field contains one
                        of the  entity  types  that  you  specified  when  you
                        trained your custom model.

                     Text -> (string)
                        The text of the entity.

                     BeginOffset -> (integer)
                        The zero-based offset from the beginning of the source
                        text to the first character in the entity.

                        This field is empty for non-text input.

                     EndOffset -> (integer)
                        The zero-based offset from the beginning of the source
                        text to the last character in the entity.

                        This field is empty for non-text input.

                     BlockReferences -> (list)
                        A  reference to each block for this entity. This field
                        is empty for plain-text input.

                        (structure)

                               Offset of the start of  the  block  within  its
                               parent block.

                            EndOffset -> (integer)
                               Offset  of the end of the block within its par-
                               ent block.

                            ChildBlocks -> (list)
                               List of child blocks within this block.

                               (structure)
                                   Nested block contained within a block.

       ErrorList -> (list)
          A list containing one object for each document that contained an er-
          ror.  The  results  are sorted in ascending order by the Index field
          and match the order of the documents in the input list. If there are
          no errors in the batch, the ErrorList is empty.

          (structure)
              Describes  an error that occurred while processing a document in
              a batch. The operation returns on BatchItemError object for each
              document that contained an error.
