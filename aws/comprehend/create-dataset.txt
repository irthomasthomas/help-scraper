OPTIONS
       --flywheel-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the flywheel of the flywheel to
          receive the data.

       --dataset-name (string)
          Name of the dataset.

       --dataset-type (string)
          The dataset type. You can specify that the data in a dataset is  for
          training the model or for testing the model.

          Possible values:

          o TRAIN

          o TEST

       --description (string)
          Description of the dataset.

       --input-data-config (structure)
          Information  about  the  input data configuration. The type of input
          data varies based on the format of the input and whether the data is
          for a classifier model or an entity recognition model.

          AugmentedManifests -> (list)
              A  list  of  augmented manifest files that provide training data
              for your custom model. An augmented manifest file is  a  labeled
              dataset that is produced by Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth.

              (structure)
                 An  augmented  manifest  file that provides training data for
                 your custom model. An augmented manifest file  is  a  labeled
                 dataset that is produced by Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth.

                 AttributeNames -> (list)
                     The JSON attribute that contains the annotations for your
                     training documents. The number of  attribute  names  that
                     you  specify  depends  on whether your augmented manifest
                     file is the output of a single labeling job or a  chained
                     labeling job.

                     If  your  file  is  the  output of a single labeling job,
                     specify the LabelAttributeName key that was used when the
                     job was created in Ground Truth.

                     If  your  file  is  the output of a chained labeling job,
                     specify the LabelAttributeName key for one or  more  jobs
                     in  the  chain.  Each LabelAttributeName key provides the
                     annotations from an individual job.

                     (string)

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     The Amazon S3 location of the augmented manifest file.

                 AnnotationDataS3Uri -> (string)
                     The S3 prefix to the annotation files that  are  referred
                     in the augmented manifest file.

                 SourceDocumentsS3Uri -> (string)
                     The  S3  prefix  to  the source files (PDFs) that are re-
                     ferred to in the augmented manifest file.

                 DocumentType -> (string)
                     The type of augmented manifest. If you don't specify, the
                     default is PlainTextDocument.
                        PLAIN_TEXT_DOCUMENT  A  document  type that represents
                        any unicode text that is encoded in UTF-8.

          DataFormat -> (string)
              COMPREHEND_CSV : The data format is a two-column CSV file, where
              the  first column contains labels and the second column contains
              documents.

              AUGMENTED_MANIFEST : The data format

          DocumentClassifierInputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The input properties for training a document classifier model.

              For more information on how the input  file  is  formatted,  see
              Preparing training data in the Comprehend Developer Guide.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  S3 URI for the input data. The S3 bucket must be
                 in the same Region as the API endpoint that you are  calling.
                 The  URI  can  point to a single input file or it can provide
                 the prefix for a collection of input files.

                 For example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix  ,  if
                 the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file
                 as input. If more than one file begins with the prefix,  Ama-
                 zon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

                 This  parameter  is required if you set DataFormat to COMPRE-
                 HEND_CSV .

              LabelDelimiter -> (string)
                 Indicates the delimiter  used  to  separate  each  label  for
                 training  a multi-label classifier. The default delimiter be-
                 tween labels is a pipe (|). You can use a different character
                 as  a  delimiter (if it's an allowed character) by specifying
                 it under Delimiter for labels. If the training documents  use
                 a delimiter other than the default or the delimiter you spec-
                 ify, the labels on that line will be combined to make a  sin-
                 gle unique label, such as LABELLABELLABEL.

          EntityRecognizerInputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The input properties for training an entity recognizer model.

              Annotations -> (structure)
                 The  S3  location of the annotation documents for your custom
                 entity recognizer.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     Specifies the Amazon S3 location where the training docu-
                     ments  for an entity recognizer are located. The URI must
                     be in the same Region as the API endpoint  that  you  are
                     calling.

              Documents -> (structure)
                 The  format  and  location of the training documents for your
                 custom entity recognizer.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     Specifies the Amazon S3 location where the documents  for
                     the dataset are located.

                 InputFormat -> (string)
                     Specifies  how  the  text in an input file should be pro-
                     cessed.  This   is   optional,   and   the   default   is
                     ONE_DOC_PER_LINE. ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is consid-
                     ered a separate document. Use this option  when  you  are
                     processing large documents, such as newspaper articles or
                     scientific papers. ONE_DOC_PER_LINE - Each line in a file
                     is  considered  a separate document. Use this option when
                     you are processing many short  documents,  such  as  text
                     messages.

              EntityList -> (structure)
                 The  S3  location  of  the entity list for your custom entity
                 recognizer.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     Specifies the Amazon S3 location where the entity list is
                     located.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique identifier for the request. If you don't set the client re-
          quest token, Amazon Comprehend generates one.

       --tags (list)
          Tags for the dataset.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair that adds as a metadata to a resource  used  by
              Amazon  Comprehend.  For  example, a tag with the key-value pair
              Department:Sales might be added to a resource  to  indicate  its
              use by a particular department.

              Key -> (string)
                 The initial part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show
                 which  resources are used by which departments, you might use
                 Department as the key portion of the pair, with multiple pos-
                 sible values such as sales, legal, and administration.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  second part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show
                 which  resources are used by which departments, you might use
                 Department as the initial (key) portion of the pair,  with  a
                 value of sales to indicate the sales department.

            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
