LIST-ENTITY-RECOGNIZERS()                            LIST-ENTITY-RECOGNIZERS()



NAME
       list-entity-recognizers -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  list of the properties of all entity recognizers that you cre-
       ated, including recognizers currently in training. Allows you to filter
       the list of recognizers based on criteria such as status and submission
       time. This call returns up to 500 entity recognizers in the list,  with
       a default number of 100 recognizers in the list.

       The  results  of  this list are not in any particular order. Please get
       the list and sort locally if needed.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-entity-recognizers is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: EntityRecognizerPropertiesList

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Filters  the  list  of entities returned. You can filter on Status ,
          SubmitTimeBefore , or SubmitTimeAfter . You can only set one  filter
          at a time.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of an entity recognizer.

          RecognizerName -> (string)
              The name that you assigned the entity recognizer.

          SubmitTimeBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of entities based on the time that the list was
              submitted for processing. Returns only jobs submitted before the
              specified time. Jobs are returned in descending order, newest to
              oldest.

          SubmitTimeAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of entities based on the time that the list was
              submitted  for processing. Returns only jobs submitted after the
              specified time. Jobs are returned in ascending order, oldest  to
              newest.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Status=string,RecognizerName=string,SubmitTimeBefore=timestamp,SubmitTimeAfter=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Status": "SUBMITTED"|"TRAINING"|"DELETING"|"STOP_REQUESTED"|"STOPPED"|"IN_ERROR"|"TRAINED"|"TRAINED_WITH_WARNING",
            "RecognizerName": "string",
            "SubmitTimeBefore": timestamp,
            "SubmitTimeAfter": timestamp
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       EntityRecognizerPropertiesList -> (list)
          The list of properties of an entity recognizer.

          (structure)
              Describes information about an entity recognizer.

              EntityRecognizerArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  that  identifies  the  entity
                 recognizer.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The language of the input documents. All documents must be in
                 the same language. Only  English  ("en")  is  currently  sup-
                 ported.

              Status -> (string)
                 Provides the status of the entity recognizer.

              Message -> (string)
                 A description of the status of the recognizer.

              SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the recognizer was submitted for processing.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the recognizer creation completed.

              TrainingStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that training of the entity recognizer started.

              TrainingEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  that  training  of  the entity recognizer was com-
                 pleted.

              InputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The input data properties of an entity recognizer.

                 DataFormat -> (string)
                     The format of your training data:

                     o COMPREHEND_CSV :  A  CSV  file  that  supplements  your
                       training  documents.  The CSV file contains information
                       about the custom entities that your trained model  will
                       detect.  The  required  format  of  the file depends on
                       whether you are  providing  annotations  or  an  entity
                       list.  If you use this value, you must provide your CSV
                       file by using either the Annotations or EntityList  pa-
                       rameters.  You  must provide your training documents by
                       using the Documents parameter.

                     o AUGMENTED_MANIFEST : A labeled dataset that is produced
                       by  Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. This file is in JSON
                       lines format. Each line is a complete JSON object  that
                       contains a training document and its labels. Each label
                       annotates a named entity in the training document.   If
                       you use this value, you must provide the AugmentedMani-
                       fests parameter in your request.

                     If you don't specify a value, Amazon Comprehend uses COM-
                     PREHEND_CSV as the default.

                 EntityTypes -> (list)
                     The entity types in the labeled training data that Amazon
                     Comprehend uses to train the  custom  entity  recognizer.
                     Any entity types that you don't specify are ignored.

                     A  maximum  of 25 entity types can be used at one time to

                            this  data.  If  you don't specify, the default is
                            train.

                            TRAIN - all of the documents in the manifest  will
                            be  used  for  training.  If no test documents are
                            provided, Amazon Comprehend will automatically re-
                            serve  a  portion  of  the  training documents for
                            testing.

                            TEST - all of the documents in the  manifest  will
                            be used for testing.

                            for your training documents. The number of  attri-
                            bute  names  that  you  specify depends on whether
                            your augmented manifest file is the  output  of  a
                            single labeling job or a chained labeling job.

                            If  your  file  is the output of a single labeling
                            job, specify the LabelAttributeName key  that  was
                            used when the job was created in Ground Truth.

                            If  your  file is the output of a chained labeling
                            job, specify the LabelAttributeName key for one or
                            more  jobs  in  the chain. Each LabelAttributeName
                            key provides the annotations  from  an  individual
                            job.

                        A  measure of the usefulness of the recognizer results
                        in the test data. High precision means that the recog-
                        nizer  returned  substantially  more  relevant results
                        than irrelevant ones.

                     Recall -> (double)
                        A measure of how complete the recognizer  results  are
                        for  the  test data. High recall means that the recog-
                        nizer returned most of the relevant results.

                     F1Score -> (double)

                        and Recall values. The F1Score is the harmonic average
                        of  the  two  scores. For plain text entity recognizer
                        models, the range is 0 to 100, where 100 is  the  best
                        score.  For  PDF/Word  entity  recognizer  models, the
                        range is 0 to 1, where 1 is the best score.

                               results  for a specific entity type in the test
                               data. High precision means that the  recognizer
                               returned  substantially  more  relevant results
                               than irrelevant ones.

                               test data. High recall means  that  the  recog-
                               nizer returned most of the relevant results.

                            F1Score -> (double)
                               A  measure  of  how accurate the recognizer re-
                               sults are for a specific  entity  type  in  the
                               test data. It is derived from the Precision and
                               Recall values. The F1Score is the harmonic  av-
                               erage  of  the two scores. The highest score is
                               1, and the worst score is 0.
