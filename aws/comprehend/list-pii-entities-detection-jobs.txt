NAME
       list-pii-entities-detection-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of the PII entity detection jobs that you have submitted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-pii-entities-detection-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: PiiEntitiesDetectionJobPropertiesList

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Filters the jobs that are returned. You can  filter  jobs  on  their
          name, status, or the date and time that they were submitted. You can
          only set one filter at a time.

          JobName -> (string)
              Filters on the name of the job.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              Filters the list of jobs based on job status. Returns only  jobs
              with the specified status.

          SubmitTimeBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted for processing. Returns only jobs  submitted  before  the
              specified  time. Jobs are returned in ascending order, oldest to
              newest.

          SubmitTimeAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted  for  processing.  Returns  only jobs submitted after the
              specified time. Jobs are returned in descending order, newest to
              oldest.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          JobName=string,JobStatus=string,SubmitTimeBefore=timestamp,SubmitTimeAfter=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "JobName": "string",
            "JobStatus": "SUBMITTED"|"IN_PROGRESS"|"COMPLETED"|"FAILED"|"STOP_REQUESTED"|"STOPPED",
            "SubmitTimeBefore": timestamp,
            "SubmitTimeAfter": timestamp
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

              JobId -> (string)
                 The identifier assigned to the PII entities detection job.

              JobArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the PII entities detection
                 job. It is a unique, fully qualified identifier for the  job.
                 It  includes the Amazon Web Services account, Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices Region, and the job ID. The format of  the  ARN  is  as
                 follows:
                     arn:<partition>:comprehend:<region>:<account-id>:pii-en-
                     tities-detection-job/<job-id>

                 The following is an example job ARN:
                     arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:pii-enti-
                     ties-detection-job/1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab

              JobStatus -> (string)
                 The  current status of the PII entities detection job. If the
                 status is FAILED , the Message field shows the reason for the
                 failure.

              Message -> (string)
                 A description of the status of a job.

              SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  that  the PII entities detection job was submitted
                 for processing.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the PII entities detection job completed.

              InputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The input properties for a PII entities detection job.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must be  in
                     same Region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The
                     URI can point to a single input file or  it  can  provide
                     the prefix for a collection of data files.

                     For  example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix ,
                     if the prefix is a single file,  Amazon  Comprehend  uses
                     that file as input. If more than one file begins with the
                     prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

                 InputFormat -> (string)
                     Specifies how the text in an input file  should  be  pro-
                     cessed:

                     o ONE_DOC_PER_FILE  -  Each file is considered a separate
                       document. Use this option when you are processing large
                       documents, such as newspaper articles or scientific pa-
                       pers.

                     o ONE_DOC_PER_LINE - Each line in a file is considered  a
                       separate  document.  Use  this option when you are pro-
                       cessing many short documents, such as text messages.

                 DocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)
                     Provides configuration parameters to override the default
                     actions  for extracting text from PDF documents and image
                     files.

                     DocumentReadAction -> (string)
                        This field defines the Amazon Textract  API  operation
                        that  Amazon  Comprehend uses to extract text from PDF
                        files and image files. Enter one of the following val-
                        ues:

                          hend service uses the DetectDocumentText API  opera-
                          tion.

                        o TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT  -  The  Amazon Comprehend
                          service uses the AnalyzeDocument API operation.

                     DocumentReadMode -> (string)
                        Determines the text extraction actions for PDF  files.
                        Enter one of the following values:

                        o SERVICE_DEFAULT  - use the Amazon Comprehend service
                          defaults for PDF files.

                        o FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION - Amazon Comprehend  uses
                          the Textract API specified by DocumentReadAction for
                          all PDF files, including digital PDF files.

                     FeatureTypes -> (list)
                        Specifies the type of Amazon Textract features to  ap-
                        ply.  If  you  chose  TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT as the
                        read action, you must specify one or both of the  fol-
                        lowing values:

                        o TABLES  -  Returns information about any tables that
                          are detected in the input document.

                            Specifies  the type of Amazon Textract features to
                            apply. If you chose  TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT  as
                            the  read  action, you must specify one or both of
                            the following values:

                            o TABLES - Returns  additional  information  about
                              any  tables that are detected in the input docu-
                              ment.

                            o FORMS - Returns additional information about any
                              forms that are detected in the input document.

              OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The output data configuration that you supplied when you cre-
                 ated the PII entities detection job.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     When you use the PiiOutputDataConfig  object  with  asyn-
                     chronous  operations,  you specify the Amazon S3 location
                     where you want to write the output data.

                     For a PII entity detection job, the output file is  plain
                     text,  not  a compressed archive. The output file name is
                     the same as the input file, with  .out  appended  at  the
                     end.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     ID  for  the  Amazon  Web Services Key Management Service
                     (KMS) key that Amazon Comprehend uses to encrypt the out-
                     put results from an analysis job.

              RedactionConfig -> (structure)
                 Provides configuration parameters for PII entity redaction.

                 This  parameter  is required if you set the Mode parameter to
                 ONLY_REDACTION . In that case, you must provide a  Redaction-
                 Config definition that includes the PiiEntityTypes parameter.

                 PiiEntityTypes -> (list)
                     An array of the types of PII entities that Amazon Compre-
                     hend detects in the input text for your request.

                     (string)

                 MaskMode -> (string)
                     Specifies whether the PII entity  is  redacted  with  the
                     mask character or the entity type.

                 MaskCharacter -> (string)
                     A  character that replaces each character in the redacted
                     PII entity.

                 Amazon Comprehend read access to your input data.

              Mode -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the output provides the locations (offsets)
                 of PII entities or a file in which PII entities are redacted.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Identifies the next page of results to return.
