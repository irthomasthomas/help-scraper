OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Filters  the  jobs  that  are returned. You can filter jobs on their
          name, status, or the date and time that they were submitted. You can
          only set one filter at a time.

          JobName -> (string)
              Filters on the name of the job.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              Filters  the list of jobs based on job status. Returns only jobs
              with the specified status.

          SubmitTimeBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted  for  processing.  Returns only jobs submitted before the
              specified time. Jobs are returned in ascending order, oldest  to
              newest.

          SubmitTimeAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted for processing. Returns only  jobs  submitted  after  the
              specified time. Jobs are returned in descending order, newest to
              oldest.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          JobName=string,JobStatus=string,SubmitTimeBefore=timestamp,SubmitTimeAfter=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "JobName": "string",
            "JobStatus": "SUBMITTED"|"IN_PROGRESS"|"COMPLETED"|"FAILED"|"STOP_REQUESTED"|"STOPPED",
            "SubmitTimeBefore": timestamp,
            "SubmitTimeAfter": timestamp
          }

       --next-token (string)
          Identifies the next page of results to return.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in each page.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the

OUTPUT
       PiiEntitiesDetectionJobPropertiesList -> (list)
          A list containing the properties of each job that is returned.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a PII entities detection job.

              JobId -> (string)
                 The identifier assigned to the PII entities detection job.

              JobArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the PII entities detection
                 job. It is a unique, fully qualified identifier for the  job.
                 It includes the AWS account, Region, and the job ID. The for-
                 mat of the ARN is as follows:
                     arn:<partition>:comprehend:<region>:<account-id>:pii-en-
                     tities-detection-job/<job-id>

                 The following is an example job ARN:
                     arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:pii-enti-
                     ties-detection-job/1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab

              JobName -> (string)
                 The name that you assigned the PII entities detection job.

              JobStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of the PII entities detection job. If  the
                 status is FAILED , the Message field shows the reason for the
                 failure.

              Message -> (string)
                 A description of the status of a job.

              SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the PII entities detection  job  was  submitted
                 for processing.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the PII entities detection job completed.

              InputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The input properties for a PII entities detection job.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     The  Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must be in
                     same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The
                     URI  can  point  to a single input file or it can provide
                     the prefix for a collection of data files.

                     For example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix  ,
                     if  the  prefix  is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses
                     that file as input. If more than one file begins with the
                     prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

                 InputFormat -> (string)
                     Specifies  how  the  text in an input file should be pro-
                     cessed:

                     o ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is considered  a  separate
                       document. Use this option when you are processing large
                       documents, such as newspaper articles or scientific pa-
                       pers.

                     o ONE_DOC_PER_LINE  - Each line in a file is considered a
                       separate document. Use this option when  you  are  pro-
                       cessing many short documents, such as text messages.

                 DocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)
                     The  document reader config field applies only for Input-
                     DataConfig of StartEntitiesDetectionJob.

                     Use DocumentReaderConfig to provide specifications  about
                     how  you want your inference documents read. Currently it
                     applies for PDF  documents  in  StartEntitiesDetectionJob
                     custom inference.

                     DocumentReadAction -> (string)
                        This  enum field will start with two values which will
                        apply to PDFs:

                        o TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT -  The  service  calls
                          DetectDocumentText for PDF documents per page.

                        o TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT  -  The service calls Ana-
                          lyzeDocument for PDF documents per page.

                     DocumentReadMode -> (string)
                        This enum field provides two values:

                        o SERVICE_DEFAULT - use service defaults for  Document
                          reading.  For Digital PDF it would mean using an in-
                          ternal parser instead of Textract APIs

                        o FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION -  Always  use  specified
                          action  for  DocumentReadAction,  including  Digital
                          PDF.

                     FeatureTypes -> (list)
                        Specifies how the text in an input file should be pro-
                        cessed:

                        (string)
                            A  list  of the types of analyses to perform. This
                            field specifies what feature types need to be  ex-
                            tracted from the document where entity recognition
                            is expected.

                            o TABLES - Add TABLES to the list to return infor-
                              mation about the tables that are detected in the
                              input document.

                            o FORMS - Add FORMS to return detected form data.

              OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The output data configuration that you supplied when you cre-
                 ated the PII entities detection job.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     When  you  use  the PiiOutputDataConfig object with asyn-
                     chronous operations, you specify the Amazon  S3  location
                     where you want to write the output data.

                     For  a PII entity detection job, the output file is plain
                     text, not a compressed archive. The output file  name  is
                     the  same  as  the  input file, with .out appended at the
                     end.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     ID for the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key that Ama-
                     zon Comprehend uses to encrypt the output results from an
                     analysis job.

              RedactionConfig -> (structure)
                 Provides configuration parameters for PII entity redaction.

                 This parameter is required if you set the Mode  parameter  to
                 ONLY_REDACTION  . In that case, you must provide a Redaction-
                 Config definition that includes the PiiEntityTypes parameter.

                 PiiEntityTypes -> (list)
                     An array of the types of PII entities that Amazon Compre-
                     hend detects in the input text for your request.

                     (string)

                 MaskMode -> (string)
                     Specifies  whether  the  PII  entity is redacted with the
                     mask character or the entity type.

                 MaskCharacter -> (string)
                     A character that replaces each character in the  redacted
                     PII entity.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The language code of the input documents

              DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that gives Amazon Comprehend
                 read access to your input data.

              Mode -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the output provides the locations (offsets)
                 of PII entities or a file in which PII entities are redacted.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Identifies the next page of results to return.
