OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Filters the jobs that are returned. You can  filter  jobs  on  their
          name, status, or the date and time that they were submitted. You can
          only set one filter at a time.

          JobName -> (string)
              Filters on the name of the job.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              Filters the list of jobs based on job status. Returns only  jobs
              with the specified status.

          SubmitTimeBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted for processing. Returns only jobs  submitted  before  the
              specified  time. Jobs are returned in ascending order, oldest to
              newest.

          SubmitTimeAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted  for  processing.  Returns  only jobs submitted after the
              specified time. Jobs are returned in descending order, newest to
              oldest.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          JobName=string,JobStatus=string,SubmitTimeBefore=timestamp,SubmitTimeAfter=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "JobName": "string",
            "JobStatus": "SUBMITTED"|"IN_PROGRESS"|"COMPLETED"|"FAILED"|"STOP_REQUESTED"|"STOPPED",
            "SubmitTimeBefore": timestamp,
            "SubmitTimeAfter": timestamp
          }

       --next-token (string)
          Identifies the next page of results to return.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in each page. The default is
          100.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

OUTPUT
       TargetedSentimentDetectionJobPropertiesList -> (list)
          A list containing the properties of each job that is returned.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a targeted sentiment detection job.

              JobId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  assigned to the targeted sentiment detection
                 job.

              JobArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the targeted sentiment  de-
                 tection  job.  It is a unique, fully qualified identifier for
                 the job. It includes the AWS account, Region, and the job ID.
                 The format of the ARN is as follows:
                     arn:<partition>:comprehend:<region>:<account-id>:tar-
                     geted-sentiment-detection-job/<job-id>

                 The following is an example job ARN:
                     arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:targeted-senti-
                     ment-detection-job/1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab

              JobName -> (string)
                 The  name  that you assigned to the targeted sentiment detec-
                 tion job.

              JobStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of the targeted sentiment  detection  job.
                 If the status is FAILED , the Messages field shows the reason
                 for the failure.

              Message -> (string)
                 A description of the status of a job.

              SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the targeted sentiment detection job  was  sub-
                 mitted for processing.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the targeted sentiment detection job ended.

              InputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The input properties for an inference job.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     The  Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must be in
                     same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The
                     URI  can  point  to a single input file or it can provide
                     the prefix for a collection of data files.

                     For example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix  ,
                     if  the  prefix  is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses
                     that file as input. If more than one file begins with the
                     prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

                 InputFormat -> (string)
                     Specifies  how  the  text in an input file should be pro-
                     cessed:

                     o ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is considered  a  separate
                       document. Use this option when you are processing large
                       documents, such as newspaper articles or scientific pa-
                       pers.

                     o ONE_DOC_PER_LINE  - Each line in a file is considered a
                       separate document. Use this option when  you  are  pro-
                       cessing many short documents, such as text messages.

                 DocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)
                     The  document reader config field applies only for Input-
                     DataConfig of StartEntitiesDetectionJob.

                     Use DocumentReaderConfig to provide specifications  about
                     how  you want your inference documents read. Currently it
                     applies for PDF  documents  in  StartEntitiesDetectionJob
                     custom inference.

                     DocumentReadAction -> (string)
                        This  enum field will start with two values which will
                        apply to PDFs:

                        o TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT -  The  service  calls
                          DetectDocumentText for PDF documents per page.

                        o TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT  -  The service calls Ana-
                          lyzeDocument for PDF documents per page.

                     DocumentReadMode -> (string)
                        This enum field provides two values:

                        o SERVICE_DEFAULT - use service defaults for  Document
                          reading.  For Digital PDF it would mean using an in-
                          ternal parser instead of Textract APIs

                        o FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION -  Always  use  specified
                          action  for  DocumentReadAction,  including  Digital
                          PDF.

                     FeatureTypes -> (list)
                        Specifies how the text in an input file should be pro-
                        cessed:

                        (string)
                            A  list  of the types of analyses to perform. This
                            field specifies what feature types need to be  ex-
                            tracted from the document where entity recognition
                            is expected.

                            o TABLES - Add TABLES to the list to return infor-
                              mation about the tables that are detected in the
                              input document.

                            o FORMS - Add FORMS to return detected form data.

              OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 Provides configuration parameters for the output of inference
                 jobs.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     When  you  use the OutputDataConfig object with asynchro-
                     nous operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where
                     you want to write the output data. The URI must be in the
                     same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The
                     location is used as the prefix for the actual location of
                     the output file.

                     When the topic detection job  is  finished,  the  service
                     creates  an  output  file  in a directory specific to the
                     job. The S3Uri field contains the location of the  output
                     file,  called  output.tar.gz . It is a compressed archive
                     that contains the ouput of the operation.

                     For a PII entity detection job, the output file is  plain
                     text,  not  a compressed archive. The output file name is
                     the same as the input file, with  .out  appended  at  the
                     end.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     ID for the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key that Ama-
                     zon Comprehend uses to encrypt the output results from an
                     analysis  job.  The  KmsKeyId can be one of the following
                     formats:

                     o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                     o Amazon   Resource   Name   (ARN)   of   a   KMS    Key:
                       "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                     o KMS Key Alias: "alias/ExampleAlias"

                     o ARN       of       a       KMS        Key        Alias:
