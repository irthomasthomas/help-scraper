SYNOPSIS
            detect-dominant-language
          --text <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --text (string)
          A UTF-8 text string. The string must contain at least 20 characters.
          The maximum string size is 100 KB.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To detect the dominant language of input text

       The following detect-dominant-language  analyzes  the  input  text  and
       identifies  the  dominant  language. The pre-trained model's confidence
       score is also output.

          aws comprehend detect-dominant-language \
              --text "It is a beautiful day in Seattle."

       Output:

          {
              "Languages": [
                  {
                      "LanguageCode": "en",
                      "Score": 0.9877256155014038
                  }
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Dominant Language in  the  Amazon  Comprehend
       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Languages -> (list)
          Array  of  languages  that  Amazon  Comprehend detected in the input
          text. The array is sorted in descending order of the score (the dom-
          inant language is always the first element in the array).

          For  each  language, the response returns the RFC 5646 language code
          and the level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the  accu-
          racy of its inference. For more information about RFC 5646, see Tags
          for Identifying Languages on the IETF Tools web site.

          (structure)
              Returns the code for the dominant language in the input text and
              the  level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the accu-
              racy of the detection.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The RFC 5646 language code for  the  dominant  language.  For
                 more  information  about  RFC  5646, see Tags for Identifying
                 Languages on the IETF Tools web site.

              Score -> (float)
                 The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the ac-
                 curacy of the detection.
