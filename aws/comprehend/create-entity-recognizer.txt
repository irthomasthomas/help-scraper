OPTIONS
       --recognizer-name (string)
          The name given to the newly created recognizer. Recognizer names can
          be a maximum of 256 characters. Alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-)
          and  underscores (_) are allowed. The name must be unique in the ac-
          count/region.

       --version-name (string)
          The version name given to  the  newly  created  recognizer.  Version
          names  can  be a maximum of 256 characters. Alphanumeric characters,
          hyphens (-) and underscores (_) are allowed. The version  name  must
          be  unique among all models with the same recognizer name in the ac-
          count/ AWS Region.

       --data-access-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS  Identity  and  Management
          (IAM)  role  that grants Amazon Comprehend read access to your input
          data.

       --tags (list)
          Tags to be associated with the entity recognizer  being  created.  A
          tag  is  a key-value pair that adds as a metadata to a resource used
          by Amazon Comprehend. For example, a tag with  "Sales"  as  the  key
          might  be  added  to a resource to indicate its use by the sales de-
          partment.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair that adds as a metadata to a resource  used  by
              Amazon  Comprehend.  For  example, a tag with the key-value pair
              Department:Sales might be added to a resource  to  indicate  its
              use by a particular department.

              Key -> (string)
                 The initial part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show
                 which  resources are used by which departments, you might use
                 Department as the key portion of the pair, with multiple pos-
                 sible values such as sales, legal, and administration.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  second part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show
                 which  resources are used by which departments, you might use
                 Department as the initial (key) portion of the pair,  with  a
                 value of sales to indicate the sales department.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --input-data-config (structure)
          Specifies  the  format and location of the input data. The S3 bucket
          containing the input data must be located in the same region as  the
          entity recognizer being created.

          DataFormat -> (string)
              The format of your training data:

              o COMPREHEND_CSV  :  A  CSV  file that supplements your training
                documents. The CSV file contains information about the  custom
                entities  that  your  trained  model will detect. The required
                format of the file depends on whether you are providing  anno-
                tations  or  an  entity  list. If you use this value, you must
                provide your CSV file by using either the Annotations  or  En-
                tityList  parameters. You must provide your training documents
                by using the Documents parameter.

              o AUGMENTED_MANIFEST : A labeled dataset  that  is  produced  by
                Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. This file is in JSON lines for-
                mat. Each line is a  complete  JSON  object  that  contains  a
                training document and its labels. Each label annotates a named
                entity in the training document.  If you use this  value,  you
                must provide the AugmentedManifests parameter in your request.

              If  you  don't  specify  a value, Amazon Comprehend uses COMPRE-
              HEND_CSV as the default.

          EntityTypes -> (list)
              The entity types in the labeled training data that  Amazon  Com-
              prehend  uses  to train the custom entity recognizer. Any entity
              types that you don't specify are ignored.

              A maximum of 25 entity types can be used at one time to train an
              entity  recognizer.  Entity types must not contain the following
              invalid characters: n (line break), \n (escaped line  break),  r
              (carriage  return),  \r  (escaped  carriage return), t (tab), \t
              (escaped tab), space, and , (comma).

              (structure)

                 Comprehend uses to train a custom entity recognizer.

                 Type -> (string)
                     An  entity  type  within  a labeled training dataset that
                     Amazon Comprehend uses to train a  custom  entity  recog-
                     nizer.

                     Entity types must not contain the following invalid char-
                     acters: n (line break), \n (escaped line break,  r  (car-
                     riage  return), \r (escaped carriage return), t (tab), \t
                     (escaped tab), space, and , (comma).

          Documents -> (structure)
              The S3 location of the folder that contains the  training  docu-
              ments for your custom entity recognizer.

              This  parameter  is  required  if  you set DataFormat to COMPRE-
              HEND_CSV .

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 Specifies the Amazon S3 location where the training documents
                 for  an entity recognizer are located. The URI must be in the
                 same region as the API endpoint that you are calling.

              TestS3Uri -> (string)
                 Specifies the Amazon S3 location where the test documents for
                 an entity recognizer are located. The URI must be in the same
                 AWS Region as the API endpoint that you are calling.

              InputFormat -> (string)
                 Specifies how the text in an input file should be  processed.
                 This  is  optional,  and  the  default  is  ONE_DOC_PER_LINE.
                 ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is considered a  separate  docu-
                 ment.  Use  this  option  when you are processing large docu-
                 ments, such  as  newspaper  articles  or  scientific  papers.
                 ONE_DOC_PER_LINE  - Each line in a file is considered a sepa-
                 rate document. Use this option when you are  processing  many
                 short documents, such as text messages.

          Annotations -> (structure)
              The  S3  location  of  the CSV file that annotates your training

              TestS3Uri -> (string)
                 Specifies the Amazon S3 location where the  test  annotations
                 for  an entity recognizer are located. The URI must be in the
                 same region as the API endpoint that you are calling.

          EntityList -> (structure)
              The S3 location of the CSV file that has  the  entity  list  for
              your custom entity recognizer.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 Specifies the Amazon S3 location where the entity list is lo-
                 cated. The URI must be in the same region as the API endpoint
                 that you are calling.

          AugmentedManifests -> (list)
              A  list  of  augmented manifest files that provide training data
              for your custom model. An augmented manifest file is  a  labeled
              dataset that is produced by Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth.

              This  parameter  is  required  if  you  set  DataFormat  to AUG-
              MENTED_MANIFEST .

              (structure)
                 An augmented manifest file that provides  training  data  for
                 your  custom  model.  An augmented manifest file is a labeled
                 dataset that is produced by Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     The Amazon S3 location of the augmented manifest file.

                 Split -> (string)
                     The purpose of the data you've provided in the  augmented
                     manifest.  You can either train or test this data. If you
                     don't specify, the default is train.

                     TRAIN - all of the documents in the manifest will be used
                     for  training.  If no test documents are provided, Amazon
                     Comprehend will automatically reserve a  portion  of  the
                     training documents for testing.

                     TEST  - all of the documents in the manifest will be used
                     for testing.

                 AttributeNames -> (list)
                     The JSON attribute that contains the annotations for your
                     training  documents.  The  number of attribute names that
                     you specify depends on whether  your  augmented  manifest
                     file  is the output of a single labeling job or a chained
                     labeling job.

                     If your file is the output  of  a  single  labeling  job,
                     specify the LabelAttributeName key that was used when the
                     job was created in Ground Truth.

                     If your file is the output of  a  chained  labeling  job,
                     specify  the  LabelAttributeName key for one or more jobs
                     in the chain. Each LabelAttributeName  key  provides  the
                     annotations from an individual job.

                     (string)

                 AnnotationDataS3Uri -> (string)
                     The  S3  prefix to the annotation files that are referred
                     in the augmented manifest file.

                     The S3 prefix to the source files  (PDFs)  that  are  re-
                     ferred to in the augmented manifest file.

                 DocumentType -> (string)
                     The  type  of  augmented  manifest.  PlainTextDocument or
                     SemiStructuredDocument. If you don't specify, the default
                     is PlainTextDocument.

                     o PLAIN_TEXT_DOCUMENT A document type that represents any
                       unicode text that is encoded in UTF-8.

                     o SEMI_STRUCTURED_DOCUMENT A  document  type  with  posi-
                       tional and structural context, like a PDF. For training
                       with Amazon Comprehend, only PDFs  are  supported.  For
                       inference,  Amazon  Comprehend  support  PDFs, DOCX and

          to import your custom model.

          Provide  your JSON as a UTF-8 encoded string without line breaks. To
          provide valid JSON for your policy, enclose the attribute names  and
          values in double quotes. If the JSON body is also enclosed in double
          quotes, then you must escape the double quotes that are  inside  the
          policy:
              "{\"attribute\": \"value\", \"attribute\": [\"value\"]}"

          To  avoid  escaping quotes, you can use single quotes to enclose the
          policy and double quotes to enclose the JSON names and values:
              '{"attribute": "value", "attribute": ["value"]}'

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
