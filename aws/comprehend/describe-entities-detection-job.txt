SYNOPSIS
            describe-entities-detection-job
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The identifier that Amazon Comprehend generated  for  the  job.  The
          StartEntitiesDetectionJob  operation  returns this identifier in its
          response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       EntitiesDetectionJobProperties -> (structure)
          An object that contains the properties associated with  an  entities
          detection job.

          JobId -> (string)
              The identifier assigned to the entities detection job.

          JobArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entities detection job. It

              the Amazon Web Services account, Amazon Web Services Region, and
              the job ID. The format of the ARN is as follows:
                 arn:<partition>:comprehend:<region>:<account-id>:entities-de-
                 tection-job/<job-id>

              The following is an example job ARN:
                 arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:entities-detec-
                 tion-job/1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab

              The name that you assigned the entities detection job.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the entities detection job. If the  status
              is FAILED , the Message field shows the reason for the failure.

              A description of the status of a job.

          SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
              The  time that the entities detection job was submitted for pro-
              cessing.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the entities detection job completed

          EntityRecognizerArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the entity recog-
              nizer.

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The  input data configuration that you supplied when you created
              the entities detection job.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must be in same
                 Region  as the API endpoint that you are calling. The URI can
                 point to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for
                 a collection of data files.

                 For  example,  if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix , if
                 the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file
                 as  input. If more than one file begins with the prefix, Ama-
                 zon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

              InputFormat -> (string)
                 Specifies how the text in an input file should be processed:

                 o ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is considered a separate docu-
                   ment.  Use  this option when you are processing large docu-
                   ments, such as newspaper articles or scientific papers.

                 o ONE_DOC_PER_LINE - Each line in a file is considered a sep-
                   arate  document.  Use  this  option when you are processing
                   many short documents, such as text messages.

              DocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)
                 Provides configuration parameters to override the default ac-
                 tions for extracting text from PDF documents and image files.

                 DocumentReadAction -> (string)
                     This field defines the Amazon Textract API operation that
                     Amazon Comprehend uses to extract text from PDF files and
                     image files. Enter one of the following values:

                     o TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT  -  The Amazon Comprehend
                       service uses the DetectDocumentText API operation.

                     o TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT - The Amazon Comprehend  ser-
                       vice uses the AnalyzeDocument API operation.

                 DocumentReadMode -> (string)
                     Determines the text extraction actions for PDF files. En-
                     ter one of the following values:

                     o SERVICE_DEFAULT - use the Amazon Comprehend service de-
                       faults for PDF files.

                     o FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION - Amazon Comprehend uses the
                       Textract API specified by  DocumentReadAction  for  all
                       PDF files, including digital PDF files.

                 FeatureTypes -> (list)
                     Specifies  the type of Amazon Textract features to apply.
                     If you chose TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT as  the  read  ac-
                     tion,  you must specify one or both of the following val-
                     ues:

                     o TABLES - Returns information about any tables that  are
                       detected in the input document.

                     o FORMS - Returns information and the data from any forms
                       that are detected in the input document.

                     (string)
                        Specifies the type of Amazon Textract features to  ap-
                        ply.  If  you  chose  TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT as the
                        read action, you must specify one or both of the  fol-
                        lowing values:

                        o TABLES  -  Returns  additional information about any
                          tables that are detected in the input document.

                        o FORMS - Returns  additional  information  about  any
                          forms that are detected in the input document.

          OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The output data configuration that you supplied when you created
              the entities detection job.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 When you use the OutputDataConfig  object  with  asynchronous
                 operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where you want
                 to write the output data. The URI must be in the same  Region
                 as  the  API  endpoint  that you are calling. The location is
                 used as the prefix for the  actual  location  of  the  output
                 file.

                 When the topic detection job is finished, the service creates
                 an output file in a directory specific to the job. The  S3Uri
                 field  contains  the location of the output file, called out-
                 put.tar.gz . It is a compressed  archive  that  contains  the
                 ouput of the operation.

                 For  a  PII  entity  detection  job, the output file is plain
                 text, not a compressed archive. The output file name  is  the
                 same as the input file, with .out appended at the end.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 ID  for  the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS)
                 key that Amazon Comprehend uses to encrypt the output results
                 from  an analysis job. Specify the Key Id of a symmetric key,
                 because you cannot use an asymmetric key for  uploading  data
                 to S3.

                 The KmsKeyId can be one of the following formats:

                 o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                 o Amazon    Resource    Name    (ARN)    of    a   KMS   Key:
                   "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                 o KMS Key Alias: "alias/ExampleAlias"

                 o ARN         of        a        KMS        Key        Alias:
