OPTIONS
       --entity-recognizer-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that  identifies  the  entity  recog-
          nizer.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              Provides the status of the entity recognizer.

          Message -> (string)
              A description of the status of the recognizer.

          SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the recognizer was submitted for processing.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the recognizer creation completed.

          TrainingStartTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that training of the entity recognizer started.

          TrainingEndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that training of the entity recognizer was completed.

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The input data properties of an entity recognizer.

              DataFormat -> (string)
                 The format of your training data:

                 o COMPREHEND_CSV  : A CSV file that supplements your training
                   documents. The CSV file contains information about the cus-
                   tom  entities  that your trained model will detect. The re-
                   quired format of the file depends on whether you  are  pro-
                   viding  annotations  or  an  entity  list.  If you use this
                   value, you must provide your CSV file by using  either  the
                   Annotations or EntityList parameters. You must provide your
                   training documents by using the Documents parameter.

                 o AUGMENTED_MANIFEST : A labeled dataset that is produced  by
                   Amazon  SageMaker  Ground Truth. This file is in JSON lines
                   format. Each line is a complete JSON object that contains a
                   training  document  and  its labels. Each label annotates a
                   named entity in the training document.   If  you  use  this
                   value, you must provide the AugmentedManifests parameter in
                   your request.

                 If you don't specify a value, Amazon Comprehend uses  COMPRE-
                 HEND_CSV as the default.

              EntityTypes -> (list)
                 The  entity  types  in  the labeled training data that Amazon
                 Comprehend uses to train the custom  entity  recognizer.  Any
                 entity types that you don't specify are ignored.

                 A maximum of 25 entity types can be used at one time to train
                 an entity recognizer. Entity types must not contain the  fol-
                 lowing  invalid  characters: n (line break), \n (escaped line
                 break), r (carriage return), \r (escaped carriage return),  t
                 (tab), \t (escaped tab), space, and , (comma).

                 (structure)
                     An  entity  type  within  a labeled training dataset that
                     Amazon Comprehend uses to train a  custom  entity  recog-
                     nizer.

                     Type -> (string)
                        An  entity type within a labeled training dataset that
                        Amazon Comprehend uses to train a custom entity recog-
                        nizer.

                        Entity  types  must  not contain the following invalid
                        characters: n (line break), \n (escaped line break,  r
                        (carriage  return),  \r  (escaped  carriage return), t
                        (tab), \t (escaped tab), and , (comma).

              Documents -> (structure)
                 The S3 location of the folder that contains the training doc-
                 uments for your custom entity recognizer.

                 This  parameter  is required if you set DataFormat to COMPRE-
                 HEND_CSV .

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     Specifies the Amazon S3 location where the training docu-
                     ments  for an entity recognizer are located. The URI must
                     be in the same Region as the API endpoint  that  you  are

                 InputFormat -> (string)
                     Specifies how the text in an input file  should  be  pro-
                     cessed.   This   is   optional,   and   the   default  is
                     ONE_DOC_PER_LINE. ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is consid-
                     ered  a  separate  document. Use this option when you are
                     processing large documents, such as newspaper articles or
                     scientific papers. ONE_DOC_PER_LINE - Each line in a file
                     is considered a separate document. Use this  option  when
                     you  are  processing  many  short documents, such as text
                     messages.

              Annotations -> (structure)
                 The S3 location of the CSV file that annotates your  training
                 documents.

                     Specifies  the  Amazon  S3 location where the annotations
                     for an entity recognizer are located. The URI must be  in
                     the same Region as the API endpoint that you are calling.

                 TestS3Uri -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  Amazon S3 location where the test annota-
                     tions for an entity recognizer are located. The URI  must
                     be  in  the  same Region as the API endpoint that you are
                     calling.

              EntityList -> (structure)
                 The S3 location of the CSV file that has the entity list  for
                 your custom entity recognizer.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     Specifies the Amazon S3 location where the entity list is
                     located. The URI must be in the same Region  as  the  API

                 A list of augmented manifest files that provide training data
                 for your custom model. An augmented manifest file  is  a  la-
                 beled  dataset  that  is  produced by Amazon SageMaker Ground
                 Truth.

                 This parameter is required if  you  set  DataFormat  to  AUG-
                 MENTED_MANIFEST .

                 (structure)
                     An  augmented  manifest  file that provides training data
                     for your custom model. An augmented manifest  file  is  a
                     labeled  dataset  that  is  produced  by Amazon SageMaker
                     Ground Truth.

                     S3Uri -> (string)
                        The Amazon S3 location of the augmented manifest file.

                     Split -> (string)
                        The purpose of the data you've provided  in  the  aug-
                        mented  manifest.  You  can  either train or test this
                        data. If you don't specify, the default is train.

                        TRAIN - all of the documents in the manifest  will  be
                        used  for training. If no test documents are provided,
                        Amazon Comprehend will automatically reserve a portion
                        of the training documents for testing.

                        TEST  -  all  of the documents in the manifest will be
                        used for testing.

                     AttributeNames -> (list)
                        The JSON attribute that contains the  annotations  for
                        your training documents. The number of attribute names
                        that you specify depends  on  whether  your  augmented
                        manifest  file  is the output of a single labeling job
                        or a chained labeling job.

                        If your file is the output of a single  labeling  job,
                        specify  the LabelAttributeName key that was used when
                        the job was created in Ground Truth.

                        If your file is the output of a chained labeling  job,
                        specify  the  LabelAttributeName  key  for one or more
                        jobs in the chain. Each  LabelAttributeName  key  pro-
                        vides the annotations from an individual job.

                        (string)

                     AnnotationDataS3Uri -> (string)
                        The  S3  prefix  to  the annotation files that are re-
                        ferred in the augmented manifest file.

                     SourceDocumentsS3Uri -> (string)
                        The S3 prefix to the source files (PDFs) that are  re-
                        ferred to in the augmented manifest file.

                     DocumentType -> (string)
                        The  type  of augmented manifest. PlainTextDocument or
                        SemiStructuredDocument. If you don't specify, the  de-
                        fault is PlainTextDocument.

                        o PLAIN_TEXT_DOCUMENT  A document type that represents
                          any unicode text that is encoded in UTF-8.

                        o SEMI_STRUCTURED_DOCUMENT A document type with  posi-
                          tional  and  structural  context,  like  a  PDF. For
                          training with Amazon Comprehend, only PDFs are  sup-
                          ported.  For  inference,  Amazon  Comprehend support
                          PDFs, DOCX and TXT.

          RecognizerMetadata -> (structure)
              Provides information about an entity recognizer.

              NumberOfTrainedDocuments -> (integer)
                 The number of documents in the input data that were  used  to
                 train  the entity recognizer. Typically this is 80 to 90 per-
                 cent of the input documents.

              NumberOfTestDocuments -> (integer)
                 The number of documents in the input data that were  used  to
                 test  the  entity recognizer. Typically this is 10 to 20 per-
                 cent of the input documents.

              EvaluationMetrics -> (structure)
                 Detailed information about the accuracy of an  entity  recog-
                 nizer.

                 Precision -> (double)
                     A  measure of the usefulness of the recognizer results in
                     the test data. High precision means that  the  recognizer
                     returned substantially more relevant results than irrele-
                     vant ones.

                 Recall -> (double)
                     A measure of how complete the recognizer results are  for
                     the  test data. High recall means that the recognizer re-
                     turned most of the relevant results.

                 F1Score -> (double)
                     A measure of how accurate the recognizer results are  for
                     the  test  data. It is derived from the Precision and Re-
                     call values. The F1Score is the harmonic average  of  the
                     two  scores. For plain text entity recognizer models, the
                     range is 0 to 100, where  100  is  the  best  score.  For
                     PDF/Word  entity  recognizer models, the range is 0 to 1,
                     where 1 is the best score.

                        Type  of  entity  from the list of entity types in the
                        metadata of an entity recognizer.

                     EvaluationMetrics -> (structure)
                        Detailed information about the accuracy of the  entity
                        recognizer  for  a specific item on the list of entity
                        types.

                        Precision -> (double)
                            A measure of the usefulness of the recognizer  re-
                            sults for a specific entity type in the test data.
                            High precision means that the recognizer  returned
                            substantially  more  relevant results than irrele-
                            vant ones.

                        Recall -> (double)
                            A measure of how complete the  recognizer  results
                            are  for  a specific entity type in the test data.
                            High recall means  that  the  recognizer  returned
                            most of the relevant results.

                        F1Score -> (double)
                            A  measure  of how accurate the recognizer results
                            are for a specific entity type in the  test  data.
                            It  is  derived from the Precision and Recall val-
                            ues. The F1Score is the harmonic  average  of  the
                            two  scores. The highest score is 1, and the worst
                            score is 0.

                     NumberOfTrainMentions -> (integer)
