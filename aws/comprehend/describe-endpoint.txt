SYNOPSIS
            describe-endpoint
          --endpoint-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the endpoint being described.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe a specific endpoint

       The following  describe-endpoint  example  gets  the  properties  of  a
       model-specific endpoint.

          aws comprehend describe-endpoint \
              --endpoint-arn arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:document-classifier-endpoint/example-classifier-endpoint

       Output:

          {
              "EndpointProperties": {
                  "EndpointArn": "arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:document-classifier-endpoint/example-classifier-endpoint,
                  "Status": "IN_SERVICE",
                  "ModelArn": "arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:document-classifier/exampleclassifier1",
                  "DesiredModelArn": "arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:document-classifier/exampleclassifier1",
                  "DesiredInferenceUnits": 1,
                  "CurrentInferenceUnits": 1,
                  "CreationTime": "2023-06-13T20:32:54.526000+00:00",
                  "LastModifiedTime": "2023-06-13T20:32:54.526000+00:00"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       EndpointProperties -> (structure)
          Describes information associated with the specific endpoint.

          EndpointArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the endpoint.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the status of the endpoint. Because the  endpoint  up-
              dates  and  creation are asynchronous, so customers will need to
              wait for the endpoint to be Ready status before making inference
              requests.

          Message -> (string)
              Specifies a reason for failure in cases of Failed status.

          ModelArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the model to which the end-
              point is attached.

          DesiredModelArn -> (string)
              ARN of the new model to use for updating an  existing  endpoint.
              This  ARN  is  going to be different from the model ARN when the
              update is in progress

          DesiredInferenceUnits -> (integer)
              The desired number of inference units to be used  by  the  model
              using  this  endpoint.  Each  inference  unit  represents  of  a
              throughput of 100 characters per second.

          CurrentInferenceUnits -> (integer)
              The number of inference units currently used by the model  using
              this endpoint.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The creation date and time of the endpoint.

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the endpoint was last modified.

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that grants Ama-
              zon Comprehend read access to trained  custom  models  encrypted
              with a customer managed key (ModelKmsKeyId).

          DesiredDataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              Data  access  role ARN to use in case the new model is encrypted
              with a customer KMS key.

          FlywheelArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the flywheel
