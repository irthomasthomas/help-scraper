OPTIONS
       --from-time (timestamp)
          The start of the time range passed in. The start time granularity is
          at  the day level. The floor of the start time is used. Returned in-
          formation occurred after this day.

       --to-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time range passed in. The start time  granularity  is
          at  the day level. The floor of the start time is used. Returned in-
          formation occurred before this day. If this is not  specified,  then
          the current day is used.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ReactiveInsights -> (integer)
          An integer that specifies the number of open  reactive  insights  in
          your  Amazon  Web Services account that were created during the time
          range passed in.

       ProactiveInsights -> (integer)
          An integer that specifies the number of open proactive  insights  in
          your  Amazon  Web Services account that were created during the time
          range passed in.

       MeanTimeToRecoverInMilliseconds -> (long)
          The Mean Time to Recover (MTTR) for all closed  insights  that  were
          created during the time range passed in.
