LIST-ANOMALOUS-LOG-GROUPS()                        LIST-ANOMALOUS-LOG-GROUPS()



NAME
       list-anomalous-log-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the list of log groups that contain log anomalies.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-anomalous-log-groups  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: InsightId, AnomalousLogGroups

SYNOPSIS
            list-anomalous-log-groups
          --insight-id <value>

OPTIONS
       --insight-id (string)
          The ID of the insight containing the log groups.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       InsightId -> (string)
          The ID of the insight containing the log groups.

       AnomalousLogGroups -> (list)
          The  list of Amazon CloudWatch log groups that are related to an in-
          sight.

          (structure)
              An Amazon CloudWatch log group that contains log  anomalies  and
              is used to generate an insight.

              LogGroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the CloudWatch log group.

              ImpactStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  the  anomalous  log events began. The impact start
                 time indicates the time of the first log anomaly  event  that
                 occurs.

              ImpactEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the anomalous log events stopped.

              NumberOfLogLinesScanned -> (integer)
                 The  number  of log lines that were scanned for anomalous log
                 events.

              LogAnomalyShowcases -> (list)
                 The log anomalies in the log group.  Each  log  anomaly  dis-
                 played represents a cluster of similar anomalous log events.

                 (structure)
                     A  cluster of similar anomalous log events found within a
                     log group.

                     LogAnomalyClasses -> (list)
                        A list of anomalous log events that may be related.

                        (structure)
                            Information about an  anomalous  log  event  found
                            within a log group.

                            LogStreamName -> (string)
                               The  name  of  the Amazon CloudWatch log stream
                               that the anomalous log event belongs to. A  log
                               stream  is  a sequence of log events that share
                               the same source.

                            LogAnomalyType -> (string)
                               The type of log anomaly that has been detected.

                            LogAnomalyToken -> (string)
                               The token where the anomaly was detected.  This
                               may  refer to an exception or another location,
                               or it may be blank for log  anomalies  such  as
                               format anomalies.

                            LogEventId -> (string)
                               The ID of the log event.

                               The  explanation  for why the log event is con-
                               sidered an anomaly.

                            NumberOfLogLinesOccurrences -> (integer)
                               The number of log lines  where  this  anomalous
                               log event occurs.

                            LogEventTimestamp -> (timestamp)

                               lous log event.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token to use to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation. If there are no more pages, this value is null.
