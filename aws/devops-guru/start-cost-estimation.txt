OPTIONS
       --resource-collection (structure)
          The collection of Amazon Web Services resources  used  to  create  a
          monthly DevOps Guru cost estimate.

          CloudFormation -> (structure)
              An  object  that specifies the CloudFormation stack that defines
              the Amazon Web Services resources used to create a monthly esti-
              mate for DevOps Guru.

              StackNames -> (list)
                 An  array of CloudFormation stack names. Its size is fixed at
                 1 item.

                 (string)

          Tags -> (list)
              The Amazon Web Services tags used to filter the resource collec-
              tion that is used for a cost estimate.

              Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Services re-
              sources. Many Amazon Web Services services support  tagging,  so
              you can assign the same tag to resources from different services
              to indicate that the resources are related. For example, you can
              assign  the  same  tag to an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that
              you assign to an Lambda function. For more information about us-
              ing tags, see the Tagging best practices whitepaper.

              Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

              o A  tag  key (for example, CostCenter , Environment , Project ,
                or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              o An  optional  field  known  as  a  tag  value  (for   example,
                111122223333  , Production , or a team name). Omitting the tag
                value is the same as using an empty string. Like  tag  keys  ,
                tag values are case-sensitive.

              Together these are known as key -value pairs.

              WARNING:
                 The  string  used  for  a key in a tag that you use to define
                 your  resource  coverage  must  begin  with  the  prefix  De-
                 vops-guru-  . The tag key might be DevOps-Guru-deployment-ap-
                 plication or devops-guru-rds-application . When you create  a
                 key  ,  the case of characters in the key can be whatever you
                 choose. After you create a key , it  is  case-sensitive.  For
                 example,  DevOps  Guru works with a key named devops-guru-rds
                 and a key named DevOps-Guru-RDS , and these act as  two  dif-
                 ferent  keys  . Possible key /value pairs in your application
                 might  be   Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS   or   De-
                 vops-Guru-production-application/containers .

              (structure)
                 Information  about  a  collection  of Amazon Web Services re-
                 sources that are identified by an Amazon  Web  Services  tag.
                 This collection of resources is used to create a monthly cost
                 estimate for DevOps Guru to analyze Amazon Web  Services  re-
                 sources.  The  maximum  number  of tags you can specify for a
                 cost estimate is one. The estimate created is for the cost to
                 analyze the Amazon Web Services resources defined by the tag.
                 For more information, see Stacks in the Amazon  Web  Services
                 CloudFormation User Guide .

                 AppBoundaryKey -> (string)
                     An  Amazon  Web Services tag key that is used to identify
                     the Amazon Web Services resources that DevOps  Guru  ana-
                     lyzes.  All Amazon Web Services resources in your account
                     and Region tagged with this key make up your DevOps  Guru
                     application and analysis boundary.

                     WARNING:
                        The string used for a key in a tag that you use to de-
                        fine your resource coverage must begin with the prefix
                        Devops-guru-  .  The  tag key might be DevOps-Guru-de-
                        ployment-application or devops-guru-rds-application  .
                        When  you create a key , the case of characters in the
                        key can be whatever you choose. After you create a key
                        , it is case-sensitive. For example, DevOps Guru works
                        with a key named devops-guru-rds and a key  named  De-
                        vOps-Guru-RDS  , and these act as two different keys .
                        Possible key /value pairs in your application might be
                        Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS      or     De-
                        vops-Guru-production-application/containers .

                 TagValues -> (list)
                     The values in an Amazon Web Services tag collection.

                     The tag's value is an optional field used to associate  a
                     string with the tag key (for example, 111122223333 , Pro-
                     duction , or a team name). The  key  and  value  are  the
                     tag's key pair. Omitting the tag value is the same as us-
                     ing an empty string. Like  tag  keys  ,  tag  values  are
                     case-sensitive.  You can specify a maximum of 256 charac-
                     ters for a tag value.

                     (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CloudFormation": {
              "StackNames": ["string", ...]
            },
            "Tags": [
              {
                "AppBoundaryKey": "string",
                "TagValues": ["string", ...]
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --client-token (string)
          The idempotency token used to identify each cost estimate request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
