LIST-MONITORED-RESOURCES()                          LIST-MONITORED-RESOURCES()



NAME
       list-monitored-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the list of all log groups that are being monitored and tagged
       by DevOps Guru.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-monitored-resources is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: MonitoredResourceIdentifiers

SYNOPSIS
            list-monitored-resources
          --filters <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (structure)
          Filters to determine which monitored resources you want to retrieve.
          You can filter by resource type or resource permission status.

          ResourcePermission -> (string)
              The permission status of a resource.

          ResourceTypeFilters -> (list)
              The type of resource that you wish  to  retrieve,  such  as  log
              groups.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResourcePermission=string,ResourceTypeFilters=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ResourcePermission": "FULL_PERMISSION"|"MISSING_PERMISSION",
            "ResourceTypeFilters": ["LOG_GROUPS", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       MonitoredResourceIdentifiers -> (list)
          Information  about  the  resource that is being monitored, including
          the name of the resource, the type of resource, and whether  or  not
          permission is given to DevOps Guru to access that resource.

          (structure)
              Information  about the resource that is being monitored, includ-
              ing the name of the resource, the type of resource, and  whether
              or  not  permission  is  given to DevOps Guru to access that re-
              source.

              MonitoredResourceName -> (string)
                 The name of the resource being monitored.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of resource being monitored.

              ResourcePermission -> (string)
                 The permission status of a resource.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token to use to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation. If there are no more pages, this value is null.
