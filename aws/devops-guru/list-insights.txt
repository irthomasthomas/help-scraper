LIST-INSIGHTS()                                                LIST-INSIGHTS()



NAME
       list-insights -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of insights in your Amazon Web Services account. You can
       specify which insights are returned by their start time and status (ON-
       GOING , CLOSED , or ANY ).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-insights  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ProactiveInsights, ReactiveInsights

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Ongoing": {
              "Type": "REACTIVE"|"PROACTIVE"
            },
            "Closed": {
              "Type": "REACTIVE"|"PROACTIVE",
              "EndTimeRange": {
                "FromTime": timestamp,
                "ToTime": timestamp
              }
            },
            "Any": {
              "Type": "REACTIVE"|"PROACTIVE",
              "StartTimeRange": {
                "FromTime": timestamp,
                "ToTime": timestamp
              }
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                     The time when the behavior in a proactive insight is  ex-
                     pected to end.

              ResourceCollection -> (structure)
                 A  collection  of  Amazon Web Services resources supported by
                 DevOps Guru. The two types of Amazon  Web  Services  resource
                 collections  supported are Amazon Web Services CloudFormation
                 stacks and Amazon Web Services  resources  that  contain  the
                 same  Amazon  Web Services tag. DevOps Guru can be configured
                 to analyze the Amazon Web Services resources that are defined
                 in the stacks or that are tagged using the same tag key . You
                 can specify up to  500  Amazon  Web  Services  CloudFormation
                 stacks.

                 CloudFormation -> (structure)
                     An  array of the names of Amazon Web Services CloudForma-
                     tion stacks. The stacks define Amazon  Web  Services  re-
                     sources  that DevOps Guru analyzes. You can specify up to
                     500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

                     StackNames -> (list)
                        An array of CloudFormation stack names.

                        (string)

                 Tags -> (list)
                     The Amazon Web Services tags that are used  by  resources
                     in the resource collection.

                     Tags  help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices resources. Many Amazon Web Services  services  sup-
                     port tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources
                     from different services to indicate  that  the  resources
                     are  related. For example, you can assign the same tag to
                     an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you assign  to  an
                     Lambda  function.  For more information about using tags,
                     see the Tagging best practices whitepaper.

                     Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

                     o A tag key (for  example,  CostCenter  ,  Environment  ,
                       Project , or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                     o An  optional  field  known as a tag value (for example,
                       111122223333 , Production , or a team  name).  Omitting
                       the  tag  value  is  the same as using an empty string.
                       Like tag keys , tag values are case-sensitive.

                     Together these are known as key -value pairs.

                     WARNING:
                        The string used for a key in a tag that you use to de-
                        fine your resource coverage must begin with the prefix
                        Devops-guru- . The tag key  might  be  DevOps-Guru-de-
                        ployment-application  or devops-guru-rds-application .
                        When you create a key , the case of characters in  the
                        key can be whatever you choose. After you create a key
                        , it is case-sensitive. For example, DevOps Guru works
                        with  a  key named devops-guru-rds and a key named De-
                        vOps-Guru-RDS , and these act as two different keys  .
                        Possible key /value pairs in your application might be
                        Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS     or      De-
                        vops-Guru-production-application/containers .

                        Tags  help  you  identify and organize your Amazon Web
                        Services resources. Many Amazon Web Services  services
                        support tagging, so you can assign the same tag to re-
                        sources from different services to indicate  that  the
                        resources are related. For example, you can assign the
                        same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you
                        assign  to  an  Lambda  function. For more information
                        about using  tags,  see  the  Tagging  best  practices

                            tion.

                            The tag's value is an optional field used to asso-
                            ciate  a  string  with  the  tag key (for example,
                            111122223333 , Production , or a team  name).  The
                            key and value are the tag's key pair. Omitting the
                            tag value is the same as using  an  empty  string.
                            Like tag keys , tag values are case-sensitive. You
                            can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a  tag
                            value.

              ResourceCollection -> (structure)
                 A collection of Amazon Web Services  resources  supported  by
                 DevOps  Guru.  The  two types of Amazon Web Services resource
                 collections supported are Amazon Web Services  CloudFormation
                 stacks  and  Amazon  Web  Services resources that contain the
                 same Amazon Web Services tag. DevOps Guru can  be  configured
                 to analyze the Amazon Web Services resources that are defined
                 in the stacks or that are tagged using the same tag key . You
                 can  specify  up  to  500  Amazon Web Services CloudFormation
                 stacks.

                 CloudFormation -> (structure)
                     An array of the names of Amazon Web Services  CloudForma-
                     tion  stacks.  The  stacks define Amazon Web Services re-
                     sources that DevOps Guru analyzes. You can specify up  to
                     500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

                     StackNames -> (list)
                        An array of CloudFormation stack names.

                        (string)

                 Tags -> (list)
                     The  Amazon  Web Services tags that are used by resources
                     in the resource collection.

                     Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web  Ser-
                     vices  resources.  Many Amazon Web Services services sup-
                     port tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources
                     from  different  services  to indicate that the resources
                     are related. For example, you can assign the same tag  to
                     an  Amazon  DynamoDB table resource that you assign to an
                     Lambda function. For more information about  using  tags,
                     see the Tagging best practices whitepaper.

                     Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

                     o A  tag  key  (for  example,  CostCenter , Environment ,
                       Project , or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                     o An optional field known as a tag  value  (for  example,
                       111122223333  ,  Production , or a team name). Omitting
                       the tag value is the same as  using  an  empty  string.
                       Like tag keys , tag values are case-sensitive.

                     Together these are known as key -value pairs.

                     WARNING:
                        The string used for a key in a tag that you use to de-
                        fine your resource coverage must begin with the prefix
                        Devops-guru-  .  The  tag key might be DevOps-Guru-de-
                        ployment-application or devops-guru-rds-application  .
                        When  you create a key , the case of characters in the
                        key can be whatever you choose. After you create a key
                        , it is case-sensitive. For example, DevOps Guru works
                        with a key named devops-guru-rds and a key  named  De-
                        vOps-Guru-RDS  , and these act as two different keys .
                        Possible key /value pairs in your application might be
                        Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS      or     De-

                        Services  resources. Many Amazon Web Services services
                        support tagging, so you can assign the same tag to re-
