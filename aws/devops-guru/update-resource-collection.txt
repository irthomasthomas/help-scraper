UPDATE-RESOURCE-COLLECTION()                      UPDATE-RESOURCE-COLLECTION()



NAME
       update-resource-collection -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the collection of resources that DevOps Guru analyzes. The two
       types of Amazon Web Services resource collections supported are  Amazon
       Web  Services  CloudFormation  stacks and Amazon Web Services resources
       that contain the same Amazon Web Services tag. DevOps Guru can be  con-
       figured  to  analyze the Amazon Web Services resources that are defined
       in the stacks or that are tagged using the same tag key . You can spec-
       ify  up  to  500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks. This method
       also creates the IAM role required for you to use DevOps Guru.

OPTIONS
       --action (string)
          Specifies if the resource collection in  the  request  is  added  or
          deleted to the resource collection.

          Possible values:

          o ADD

          o REMOVE

       --resource-collection (structure)
          Contains  information used to update a collection of Amazon Web Ser-
          vices resources.

          CloudFormation -> (structure)
              A collection of Amazon Web Services CloudFormation  stacks.  You
              can specify up to 500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

              StackNames -> (list)
                 An  array of the names of the Amazon Web Services CloudForma-
                 tion stacks to update. You can specify up to 500  Amazon  Web
                 Services CloudFormation stacks.

                 (string)

          Tags -> (list)
              The  updated  Amazon  Web  Services  tags used to filter the re-
              sources in the resource collection.

              Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Services re-
              sources.  Many  Amazon Web Services services support tagging, so
              you can assign the same tag to resources from different services
              to indicate that the resources are related. For example, you can
              assign the same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB  table  resource  that
              you assign to an Lambda function. For more information about us-
              ing tags, see the Tagging best practices whitepaper.

              Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

              o A tag key (for example, CostCenter , Environment ,  Project  ,
                or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              o An   optional  field  known  as  a  tag  value  (for  example,
                111122223333 , Production , or a team name). Omitting the  tag
                value  is  the  same as using an empty string. Like tag keys ,
                tag values are case-sensitive.

              Together these are known as key -value pairs.

              WARNING:
                 The string used for a key in a tag that  you  use  to  define
                 your  resource  coverage  must  begin  with  the  prefix  De-
                 vops-guru- . The tag key might be  Devops-guru-deployment-ap-
                 plication  or  Devops-guru-rds-application  .  While keys are
                 case-sensitive, the case of key characters  don't  matter  to
                 DevOps  Guru. For example, DevOps Guru works with a key named
                 devops-guru-rds and a key named  DevOps-Guru-RDS  .  Possible
                 key   /value   pairs   in   your  application  might  be  De-
                 vops-Guru-production-application/RDS  or  Devops-Guru-produc-
                 tion-application/containers .

              (structure)
                 A  new  collection  of Amazon Web Services resources that are
                 defined by an Amazon Web Services tag or tag key /value pair.

                 AppBoundaryKey -> (string)
                     An Amazon Web Services tag key that is used  to  identify
                     the  Amazon  Web Services resources that DevOps Guru ana-
                     lyzes. All Amazon Web Services resources in your  account
                     and  Region tagged with this key make up your DevOps Guru
                     application and analysis boundary.

                     WARNING:
                        The string used for a key in a tag that you use to de-
                        fine your resource coverage must begin with the prefix
                        Devops-guru- . The tag key  might  be  Devops-guru-de-
                        ployment-application  or Devops-guru-rds-application .
                        While keys are case-sensitive, the case of key charac-
                        ters  don't matter to DevOps Guru. For example, DevOps
                        Guru works with a key named devops-guru-rds and a  key
                        named  DevOps-Guru-RDS  . Possible key /value pairs in
                        your application might  be  Devops-Guru-production-ap-
                        plication/RDS    or    Devops-Guru-production-applica-
                        tion/containers .

                 TagValues -> (list)
                     The values in an Amazon Web Services tag collection.

                     The tag's value is an optional field used to associate  a
                     string with the tag key (for example, 111122223333 , Pro-
                     duction , or a team name). The  key  and  value  are  the
                     tag's key pair. Omitting the tag value is the same as us-
                     ing an empty string. Like  tag  keys  ,  tag  values  are
                     case-sensitive.  You can specify a maximum of 256 charac-
                     ters for a tag value.

                     (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CloudFormation": {
              "StackNames": ["string", ...]
            },
            "Tags": [
              {
                "AppBoundaryKey": "string",
                "TagValues": ["string", ...]
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.
