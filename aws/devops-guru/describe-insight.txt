          [--account-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the insight.

       --account-id (string)
          The ID of the member account in the organization.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          ResourceCollection -> (structure)
              A collection of Amazon Web Services resources supported  by  De-
              vOps Guru. The two types of Amazon Web Services resource collec-
              tions supported are Amazon Web  Services  CloudFormation  stacks
              and  Amazon  Web Services resources that contain the same Amazon
              Web Services tag. DevOps Guru can be configured to  analyze  the
              Amazon  Web Services resources that are defined in the stacks or
              that are tagged using the same tag key . You can specify  up  to
              500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

              CloudFormation -> (structure)
                 An  array  of the names of Amazon Web Services CloudFormation
                 stacks. The stacks define Amazon Web Services resources  that
                 DevOps  Guru  analyzes.  You can specify up to 500 Amazon Web
                 Services CloudFormation stacks.

                 StackNames -> (list)
                     An array of CloudFormation stack names.

                     (string)

              Tags -> (list)
                 The Amazon Web Services tags that are used  by  resources  in
                 the resource collection.

                 Tags  help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Services
                 resources. Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging,
                 so  you  can  assign the same tag to resources from different
                 services to indicate that the resources are related. For  ex-
                 ample,  you can assign the same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB ta-
                 ble resource that you assign to an Lambda function. For  more
                 information  about using tags, see the Tagging best practices
                 whitepaper.

                 Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

                 o A tag key (for example, CostCenter , Environment ,  Project
                   , or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 o An  optional  field  known  as  a  tag  value (for example,
                   111122223333 , Production , or a team name).  Omitting  the
                   tag  value  is  the same as using an empty string. Like tag
                   keys , tag values are case-sensitive.

                 Together these are known as key -value pairs.

                 WARNING:
                     The string used for a key in a tag that you use to define
                     your  resource  coverage  must  begin with the prefix De-
                     vops-guru- . The tag  key  might  be  Devops-guru-deploy-
                     ment-application  or  Devops-guru-rds-application . While
                     keys are case-sensitive, the case of key characters don't
                     matter  to  DevOps  Guru.  For example, DevOps Guru works
                     with a key named devops-guru-rds  and  a  key  named  De-
                     vOps-Guru-RDS  . Possible key /value pairs in your appli-
                     cation might be Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS or
                     Devops-Guru-production-application/containers .

                        While keys are case-sensitive, the case of key charac-
                        ters  don't matter to DevOps Guru. For example, DevOps
                        Guru works with a key named devops-guru-rds and a  key
                        named  DevOps-Guru-RDS  . Possible key /value pairs in
                        your application might  be  Devops-Guru-production-ap-

                     AppBoundaryKey -> (string)
                        An Amazon Web Services tag key that is used  to  iden-
                        tify  the  Amazon  Web  Services resources that DevOps
                        Guru analyzes. All Amazon Web  Services  resources  in
                        your  account  and Region tagged with this key make up
                        your DevOps Guru application and analysis boundary.

                        WARNING:
                            The string used for a key in a tag that you use to
                            define  your resource coverage must begin with the
                            prefix Devops-guru- . The tag  key  might  be  De-

                     TagValues -> (list)
                        The values in an Amazon Web Services tag collection.

                        The tag's value is an optional field used to associate
                        a string with the tag key (for example, 111122223333 ,
                        Production  ,  or  a team name). The key and value are
                        the tag's key pair. Omitting the tag value is the same
                        as  using  an empty string. Like tag keys , tag values
                        are case-sensitive. You can specify a maximum  of  256
                        characters for a tag value.

                        (string)

          SsmOpsItemId -> (string)
              The ID of the Amazon Web Services System Manager OpsItem created
              for this insight. You must enable the creation of OpstItems  in-
              sights before they are created for each insight.

          Description -> (string)
              Describes the proactive insight.

                     o An  optional  field  known as a tag value (for example,
                       111122223333 , Production , or a team  name).  Omitting
                       the  tag  value  is  the same as using an empty string.
                       Like tag keys , tag values are case-sensitive.

                     Together these are known as key -value pairs.

                     WARNING:
                        The string used for a key in a tag that you use to de-
                        fine your resource coverage must begin with the prefix
                        Devops-guru- . The tag key  might  be  Devops-guru-de-
                        ployment-application  or Devops-guru-rds-application .
                        While keys are case-sensitive, the case of key charac-
                        ters  don't matter to DevOps Guru. For example, DevOps
                        Guru works with a key named devops-guru-rds and a  key
                        named  DevOps-Guru-RDS  . Possible key /value pairs in
                        your application might  be  Devops-Guru-production-ap-
                        plication/RDS    or    Devops-Guru-production-applica-
                        tion/containers .

                     AppBoundaryKey -> (string)
                        An Amazon Web Services tag key that is used  to  iden-
                        tify  the  Amazon  Web  Services resources that DevOps
                        Guru analyzes. All Amazon Web  Services  resources  in
                        your  account  and Region tagged with this key make up
                        your DevOps Guru application and analysis boundary.

                        WARNING:
                            The string used for a key in a tag that you use to
                            define  your resource coverage must begin with the
                            prefix Devops-guru- . The tag  key  might  be  De-
                            vops-guru-deployment-application       or      De-
                            vops-guru-rds-application   .   While   keys   are
                            case-sensitive,  the  case of key characters don't
                            matter to DevOps Guru. For  example,  DevOps  Guru
                            works  with  a key named devops-guru-rds and a key
                            named DevOps-Guru-RDS . Possible key /value  pairs
                            in  your  application might be Devops-Guru-produc-
                            tion-application/RDS or Devops-Guru-production-ap-
                            plication/containers .

                     TagValues -> (list)
                        The values in an Amazon Web Services tag collection.

                        The tag's value is an optional field used to associate
                        a string with the tag key (for example, 111122223333 ,
                        Production  ,  or  a team name). The key and value are
                        the tag's key pair. Omitting the tag value is the same
                        as  using  an empty string. Like tag keys , tag values
                        are case-sensitive. You can specify a maximum  of  256
                        characters for a tag value.
