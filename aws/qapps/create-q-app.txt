CREATE-Q-APP()                                                  CREATE-Q-APP()



NAME
       create-q-app -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new Amazon Q App based on the provided definition. The Q App
       definition specifies the cards and flow of the Q  App.  This  operation
       also  calculates  the  dependencies between the cards by inspecting the
       references in the prompts.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       create-q-app uses document type values. Document types follow the  JSON
       data  model  where  valid values are: strings, numbers, booleans, null,
       arrays, and objects. For command input, options and  nested  parameters
       that  are  labeled  with  the  type  document must be provided as JSON.
       Shorthand syntax does not support document types.

       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
