NAME
       predict-q-app -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  an Amazon Q App definition based on either a conversation or
       a problem statement provided as input.The resulting app definition  can
       be  used to call CreateQApp . This API doesn't create Amazon Q Apps di-
       rectly.

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the Amazon Q Business application  environ-
          ment instance.

       --options (tagged union structure)
          The  input to generate the Q App definition from, either a conversa-
          tion or problem statement.

          NOTE:
              This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following  top
              level keys can be set: conversation, problemStatement.

          conversation -> (list)
              A  conversation to use as input for generating the Q App defini-
              tion.

              (structure)
                 A message in a conversation, used as input for generating  an
                 Amazon Q App definition.

                 body -> (string)
                     The text content of the conversation message.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of the conversation message.

          problemStatement -> (string)
              A  problem  statement  to  use as input for generating the Q App
              definition.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          conversation=[{body=string,type=string},{body=string,type=string}],problemStatement=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "conversation": [
              {
                "body": "string",
                "type": "USER"|"SYSTEM"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "problemStatement": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
