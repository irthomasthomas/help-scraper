OPTIONS
       --connection-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a connection.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about a connection

       The following get-connection example shows details about a connection.

          aws codestar-connections get-connection \
              --connection-arn arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-1:123456789012:connection/aEXAMPLE-8aad-4d5d-8878-dfcab0bc441f

       Output:

          {
              "Connection": {
                  "ConnectionName": "MyConnection",
                  "ConnectionArn": "arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-1:123456789012:connection/aEXAMPLE-8aad-4d5d-8878-dfcab0bc441f",
                  "ProviderType": "Bitbucket",
                  "OwnerAccountId": "123456789012",
                  "ConnectionStatus": "AVAILABLE"
              }
          }

       For more information, see View  connection  details  in  the  Developer
       Tools console User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Connection -> (structure)
          The connection details, such as status, owner, and provider type.

          ConnectionName -> (string)
              The  name  of the connection. Connection names must be unique in
              an AWS user account.

          ConnectionArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  connection.  The  ARN  is
              used  as  the connection reference when the connection is shared
              between AWS services.

              NOTE:
                 The ARN is never reused if the connection is deleted.

          ProviderType -> (string)
              The name of the external provider where  your  third-party  code
              repository is configured.

          OwnerAccountId -> (string)
              The  identifier  of the external provider where your third-party
              code repository is configured. For Bitbucket, this  is  the  ac-
              count ID of the owner of the Bitbucket repository.

          ConnectionStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the connection.

          HostArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the host associated with the
              connection.
