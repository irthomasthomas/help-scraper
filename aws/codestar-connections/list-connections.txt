NAME
       list-connections -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the connections associated with your account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-connections
          [--provider-type-filter <value>]
          [--host-arn-filter <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --provider-type-filter (string)
          Filters the list of connections to those associated with a specified
          provider, such as Bitbucket.

          Possible values:

          o Bitbucket

          o GitHub

          o GitHubEnterpriseServer

       --host-arn-filter (string)
          Filters the list of connections to those associated with a specified
          host.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  results to return in a single call. To re-
          trieve the remaining results, make another call  with  the  returned
          nextToken value.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token that was returned from the previous ListConnections call,
          which can be used to return the next set of connections in the list.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list connections

       The following list-connections example retrieves a list of all  connec-
       tions in your account for the Bitbucket provider type.:

          aws codestar-connections list-connections \
          --provider-type Bitbucket \
          --max-results 5 \
          --next-token: next-token

       Output:

          {
              "Connections": [
                  {
                      "ConnectionName": "my-connection",
                      "ProviderType": "Bitbucket",
                      "Status": "PENDING",
                      "ARN": "arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-1:123456789012:connection/aEXAMPLE-8aad-4d5d-8878-dfcab0bc441f",
                      "OwnerAccountId": "123456789012"
                  },
                  {
                      "ConnectionName": "my-other-connection",
                      "ProviderType": "Bitbucket",
                      "Status": "AVAILABLE",
                      "ARN": "arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-1:123456789012:connection/aEXAMPLE-8aad-4d5d-8878-dfcab0bc441f",
                      "OwnerAccountId": "123456789012"
                  },
              ],
              "NextToken": "next-token"
          }

       For more information, see List connections (CLI) in the Developer Tools
       console User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Connections -> (list)
          A list of connections and the details for each connection,  such  as
          status, owner, and provider type.

          (structure)
              A  resource that is used to connect third-party source providers
              with services like AWS CodePipeline.

              Note: A connection created through CloudFormation, the  CLI,  or
              the SDK is in PENDING status by default. You can make its status
              AVAILABLE by updating the connection in the console.

              ConnectionName -> (string)
                 The name of the connection. Connection names must  be  unique
                 in an AWS user account.

              ConnectionArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the connection. The ARN is
                 used as the  connection  reference  when  the  connection  is
                 shared between AWS services.

                 NOTE:
                     The ARN is never reused if the connection is deleted.

              ProviderType -> (string)
                 The name of the external provider where your third-party code
                 repository is configured.

              OwnerAccountId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of  the   external   provider   where   your
                 third-party  code  repository  is  configured. For Bitbucket,
                 this is the account ID of the owner of the Bitbucket  reposi-
                 tory.

              ConnectionStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of the connection.

              HostArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the host associated with
                 the connection.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that can be used in the next ListConnections call.  To  view
          all  items  in  the  list, continue to call this operation with each
          subsequent token until no more nextToken values are returned.
