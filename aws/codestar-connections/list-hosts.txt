OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  results to return in a single call. To re-
          trieve the remaining results, make another call  with  the  returned
          nextToken value.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token that was returned from the previous ListHosts call, which
          can be used to return the next set of hosts in the list.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list hosts

       The  following list-hosts example retrieves a list of all hosts in your
       account.

          aws codestar-connections list-hosts

       Output:

          {
              "Hosts": [
                  {
                      "Name": "My-Host",
                      "HostArn": "arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-1:123456789012:host/My-Host-28aef605",
                      "ProviderType": "GitHubEnterpriseServer",
                      "ProviderEndpoint": "https://my-instance.test.dev",
                      "Status": "AVAILABLE"
                  }
              ]
          }

       sole User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Hosts -> (list)
          A  list of hosts and the details for each host, such as status, end-
          point, and provider type.

          (structure)
              A  resource  that  represents   the   infrastructure   where   a
              third-party  provider  is  installed.  The host is used when you
              create connections to an installed  third-party  provider  type,
              such  as  GitHub  Enterprise Server. You create one host for all
              connections to that provider.

              NOTE:
                 A host created through the CLI or the SDK is in PENDING  sta-
                 tus  by default. You can make its status AVAILABLE by setting
                 up the host in the console.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the host.

              HostArn -> (string)

                 The name of the installed provider to be associated with your
                 connection.  The  host resource represents the infrastructure
                 where your provider type is  installed.  The  valid  provider
                 type is GitHub Enterprise Server.

              ProviderEndpoint -> (string)
                 The  endpoint  of the infrastructure where your provider type
                 is installed.

              VpcConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The VPC configuration provisioned for the host.

                 VpcId -> (string)
                     The ID of the Amazon VPC connected to the  infrastructure
                     where your provider type is installed.

                 SubnetIds -> (list)
                     The  ID of the subnet or subnets associated with the Ama-
                     zon  VPC  connected  to  the  infrastructure  where  your
                     provider type is installed.

                     (string)

                 SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                     The  ID  of the security group or security groups associ-
                     ated with the Amazon VPC connected to the  infrastructure
                     where your provider type is installed.

                     (string)

                 TlsCertificate -> (string)
                     The  value of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) certifi-
                     cate  associated  with  the  infrastructure  where   your
                     provider type is installed.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  status of the host, such as PENDING, AVAILABLE, VPC_CON-
                 FIG_DELETING,    VPC_CONFIG_INITIALIZING,    and     VPC_CON-
                 FIG_FAILED_INITIALIZATION.

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 The status description for the host.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  can  be used in the next ListHosts call. To view all
          items in the list, continue to call this operation with each  subse-
          quent token until no more nextToken values are returned.
