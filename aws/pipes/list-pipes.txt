NAME
       list-pipes -

DESCRIPTION
       Get  the pipes associated with this account. For more information about
       pipes, see Amazon EventBridge Pipes  in  the  Amazon  EventBridge  User
       Guide.

       list-pipes  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Pipes

OPTIONS
       --name-prefix (string)
          A value that will return a subset of the pipes associated with  this
          account.  For example, "NamePrefix": "ABC" will return all endpoints
          with "ABC" in the name.

       --desired-state (string)
          The state the pipe should be in.

          Possible values:

          o RUNNING

          o STOPPED

       --current-state (string)
          The state the pipe is in.

          Possible values:

          o RUNNING

          o STOPPED

          o CREATING

          o UPDATING

          o DELETING

          o STARTING

          o STOPPING

          o CREATE_FAILED

          o UPDATE_FAILED

          o START_FAILED

          o STOP_FAILED

          o DELETE_FAILED

          o CREATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED

          o DELETE_ROLLBACK_FAILED

          o UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED

       --source-prefix (string)
          The prefix matching the pipe source.

       --target-prefix (string)
          The prefix matching the pipe target.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Pipes -> (list)
          The pipes returned by the call.

          (structure)
              An  object  that represents a pipe. Amazon EventBridgePipes con-
              nect event sources to targets and reduces the need for  special-
              ized knowledge and integration code.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the pipe.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the pipe.

              DesiredState -> (string)
                 The state the pipe should be in.

              CurrentState -> (string)
                 The state the pipe is in.

              StateReason -> (string)
                 The reason the pipe is in its current state.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the pipe was created.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 When   the   pipe   was  last  updated,  in  ISO-8601  format
                 (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD).

              Source -> (string)
                 The ARN of the source resource.

              Target -> (string)
                 The ARN of the target resource.

              Enrichment -> (string)
                 The ARN of the enrichment resource.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If nextToken is returned, there  are  more  results  available.  The
          value  of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page. Make
          the call again using the returned token to retrieve the  next  page.
          Keep  all  other  arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires
          after 24 hours. Using an expired pagination  token  will  return  an
          HTTP 400 InvalidToken error.
