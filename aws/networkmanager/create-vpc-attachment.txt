          The ID of a core network for the VPC attachment.

       --vpc-arn (string)
          The ARN of the VPC.

       --subnet-arns (list)
          The subnet ARN of the VPC attachment.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --options (structure)
          Options for the VPC attachment.

          Ipv6Support -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether IPv6 is supported.

          ApplianceModeSupport -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether appliance mode is supported. If enabled, traf-
              fic flow between a source and destination use  the  same  Avail-
              ability  Zone  for  the  VPC attachment for the lifetime of that
              flow. The default value is false .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Ipv6Support=boolean,ApplianceModeSupport=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Ipv6Support": true|false,
            "ApplianceModeSupport": true|false
          }

       --tags (list)
          The key-value tags associated with the request.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key.

                 Constraints: Maximum length of 128 characters.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

                 Constraints: Maximum length of 256 characters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",

            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-token (string)
          The client token associated with the request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a VPC attachment

       The  following  create-vpc-attachment  example creates a VPC attachment
       with IPv6 support in a core network.

              --core-network-id core-network-0fab62fe438d94db6 \
              --vpc-arn arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:987654321012:vpc/vpc-09f37f69e2786eeb8  \
              --subnet-arns arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:987654321012:subnet/subnet-04ca4e010857e7bb7 \
              --Ipv6Support=true
