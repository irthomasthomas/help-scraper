          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --core-network-id (string)
          The ID of a core network for the VPC attachment.

       --vpc-arn (string)
          The ARN of the VPC.

       --subnet-arns (list)
          The subnet ARN of the VPC attachment.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --options (structure)
          Options for the VPC attachment.

          Ipv6Support -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether IPv6 is supported.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Ipv6Support=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Ipv6Support": true|false
          }

       --tags (list)
          The key-value tags associated with the request.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key.

                 Constraints: Maximum length of 128 characters.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

                 Constraints: Maximum length of 256 characters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-token (string)
          The client token associated with the request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a VPC attachment

       The following create-vpc-attachment example creates  a  VPC  attachment
       with IPv6 support in a core network.

          aws networkmanager create-vpc-attachment \
              --core-network-id core-network-0fab62fe438d94db6 \
              --vpc-arn arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:987654321012:vpc/vpc-09f37f69e2786eeb8  \
              --subnet-arns arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:987654321012:subnet/subnet-04ca4e010857e7bb7 \
              --Ipv6Support=true

       Output:
