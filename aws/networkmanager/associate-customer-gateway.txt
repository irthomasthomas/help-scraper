ASSOCIATE-CUSTOMER-GATEWAY()                      ASSOCIATE-CUSTOMER-GATEWAY()



NAME
       associate-customer-gateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  a  customer  gateway  with  a device and optionally, with a
       link. If you specify a link, it must be associated with  the  specified
       device.

       You  can  only  associate customer gateways that are connected to a VPN
       attachment on a transit gateway or  core  network  registered  in  your
       global  network.  When  you register a transit gateway or core network,
       customer gateways that are connected to the transit gateway  are  auto-
       matically  included  in  the  global network. To list customer gateways
       that are connected to a transit gateway, use the DescribeVpnConnections
       EC2 API and filter by transit-gateway-id .

       You  cannot  associate a customer gateway with more than one device and
       link.

OPTIONS
       --customer-gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the customer gateway.

       --global-network-id (string)
          The ID of the global network.

       --device-id (string)
          The ID of the device.

       --link-id (string)
          The ID of the link.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       gateway cgw-11223344556677889 in the specified global network with  de-
       vice device-07f6fd08867abc123.

          aws networkmanager associate-customer-gateway \
              --customer-gateway-arn arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:customer-gateway/cgw-11223344556677889  \
              --global-network-id global-network-01231231231231231 \
              --device-id device-07f6fd08867abc123 \
              --region us-west-2
