NAME
       get-core-network-change-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a core network change event.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-core-network-change-events  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: CoreNetworkChangeEvents

SYNOPSIS
            get-core-network-change-events
          --core-network-id <value>
          --policy-version-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --core-network-id (string)
          The ID of a core network.

       --policy-version-id (integer)
          The ID of the policy version.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CoreNetworkChangeEvents -> (list)
          The response to GetCoreNetworkChangeEventsRequest .

          (structure)
              Describes a core network change event. This can be a change to a
              segment, attachment, route, etc.

              Type -> (string)
                 Describes the type of change event.

              Action -> (string)
                 The action taken for the change event.

              IdentifierPath -> (string)
                 Uniquely  identifies the path for a change within the change-
                 set. For example, the IdentifierPath for a core network  seg-
                 ment  change might be "CORE_NETWORK_SEGMENT/us-east-1/devseg-
                 ment" .

              EventTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp for an event change in status.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the core network change event.

              Values -> (structure)
                 Details of the change event.

                 EdgeLocation -> (string)
                     The edge location for the core network change event.

                 SegmentName -> (string)
                     The segment name if the change event is associated with a
                     segment.

                 AttachmentId -> (string)
                     The  ID  of the attachment if the change event is associ-
                     ated with an attachment.

                 Cidr -> (string)
                     For a STATIC_ROUTE event, this is the IP address.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next page of results.
