NAME
       create-connect-peer -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  core network Connect peer for a specified core network con-
       nect attachment between a core network and an appliance. The  peer  ad-
       dress  and  transit  gateway address must be the same IP address family
       (IPv4 or IPv6).

          The ID of the connection attachment.

       --core-network-address (string)

          protocol is GRE .

       --peer-address (string)
          The Connect peer address.

       --bgp-options (structure)
          The Connect peer BGP options. This only applies only when the proto-
          col is GRE .

          PeerAsn -> (long)
              The Peer ASN of the BGP.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PeerAsn=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "PeerAsn": long
          }

       --inside-cidr-blocks (list)
          The inside IP addresses used for BGP peering.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The tags associated with the peer request.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key.

                 Constraints: Maximum length of 128 characters.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

                 Constraints: Maximum length of 256 characters.

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"

       --subnet-arn (string)
          The subnet ARN for the Connect peer. This only applies only when the
          protocol is NO_ENCAP.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
