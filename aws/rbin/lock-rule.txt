LOCK-RULE()                                                        LOCK-RULE()



NAME
       lock-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Locks  a  Region-level retention rule. A locked retention rule can't be
       modified or deleted.

       NOTE:
          You can't lock tag-level retention rules, or Region-level  retention
          rules that have exclusion tags.

OPTIONS
       --identifier (string)
          The unique ID of the retention rule.

       --lock-configuration (structure)
          Information about the retention rule lock configuration.

          UnlockDelay -> (structure)
              Information about the retention rule unlock delay.

              UnlockDelayValue -> (integer)
                 The  unlock  delay period, measured in the unit specified for
                 UnlockDelayUnit .

              UnlockDelayUnit -> (string)
                 The unit of time in which to measure the unlock  delay.  Cur-
                 rently, the unlock delay can be measure only in days.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          UnlockDelay={UnlockDelayValue=integer,UnlockDelayUnit=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "UnlockDelay": {
              "UnlockDelayValue": integer,
              "UnlockDelayUnit": "DAYS"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
