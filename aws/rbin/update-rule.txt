NAME
       update-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates an existing Recycle Bin retention rule. You can update a reten-
       tion rule's description, resource tags, and  retention  period  at  any
       time  after creation. You can't update a retention rule's resource type
       after creation. For more information, see Update Recycle Bin  retention
       rules in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --identifier (string)
          The unique ID of the retention rule.

       --retention-period (structure)
          Information  about the retention period for which the retention rule
          is to retain resources.

          RetentionPeriodValue -> (integer)
              The period value for which the retention rule is to  retain  re-
              sources. The period is measured using the unit specified for Re-
              tentionPeriodUnit .

          RetentionPeriodUnit -> (string)
              The unit of time in which the retention period is measured. Cur-
              rently, only DAYS is supported.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RetentionPeriodValue=integer,RetentionPeriodUnit=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RetentionPeriodValue": integer,
            "RetentionPeriodUnit": "DAYS"
          }

       --description (string)
          The retention rule description.

       --resource-type (string)

          NOTE:
              This  parameter  is  currently not supported. You can't update a
              retention rule's resource type after creation.

          Possible values:

          o EBS_SNAPSHOT

          o EC2_IMAGE

       --resource-tags (list)
          Specifies the resource tags to use to identify resources that are to
          be  retained  by a tag-level retention rule. For tag-level retention
          rules, only deleted resources, of the specified resource type,  that
          have  one  or  more of the specified tag key and value pairs are re-
          tained. If a resource is deleted, but it does not have  any  of  the
          specified tag key and value pairs, it is immediately deleted without
          being retained by the retention rule.

          You can add the same tag key and value pair to a maximum or five re-
          tention rules.

          To  create a Region-level retention rule, omit this parameter. A Re-
          gion-level retention rule does not have any resource tags specified.
          It  retains  all deleted resources of the specified resource type in
          the Region in which the rule is created, even if the  resources  are
          not tagged.

          (structure)
              Information  about  the resource tags used to identify resources
              that are retained by the retention rule.

              ResourceTagKey -> (string)
                 The tag key.

              ResourceTagValue -> (string)
                 The tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResourceTagKey=string,ResourceTagValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ResourceTagKey": "string",
              "ResourceTagValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

       LockState -> (string)
          The lock state for the retention rule.

          o locked - The retention rule is locked and  can't  be  modified  or

          o pending_unlock  -  The  retention rule has been unlocked but it is
            still within the unlock delay period. The retention  rule  can  be
