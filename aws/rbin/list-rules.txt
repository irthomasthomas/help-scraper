LIST-RULES()                                                      LIST-RULES()



NAME
       list-rules -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the Recycle Bin retention rules in the Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-rules  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Rules

OPTIONS
       --resource-type (string)
          The resource type retained by the  retention  rule.  Only  retention
          rules that retain the specified resource type are listed. Currently,
          only Amazon EBS snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs are supported. To list
          retention  rules  that  retain  snapshots, specify EBS_SNAPSHOT . To
          list retention rules that retain EBS-backed AMIs, specify  EC2_IMAGE
          .

          Possible values:

          o EBS_SNAPSHOT

          o EC2_IMAGE

       --resource-tags (list)
          Information  about the resource tags used to identify resources that
          are retained by the retention rule.

          (structure)
              Information about the resource tags used to  identify  resources
              that are retained by the retention rule.

              ResourceTagKey -> (string)
                 The tag key.

              ResourceTagValue -> (string)
                 The tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResourceTagKey=string,ResourceTagValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ResourceTagKey": "string",
              "ResourceTagValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --lock-state (string)
          The  lock state of the retention rules to list. Only retention rules
          with the specified lock state are returned.

          Possible values:

          o locked

          o pending_unlock

          o unlocked

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Rules -> (list)
          Information about the retention rules.

          (structure)
              Information about a Recycle Bin retention rule.

              Identifier -> (string)
                 The unique ID of the retention rule.

              Description -> (string)
                 The retention rule description.

              RetentionPeriod -> (structure)
                 Information about the retention period for which  the  reten-
                 tion rule is to retain resources.

                 RetentionPeriodValue -> (integer)
                     The  period  value for which the retention rule is to re-
                     tain resources. The period is  measured  using  the  unit
                     specified for RetentionPeriodUnit .

                 RetentionPeriodUnit -> (string)
                     The  unit  of  time in which the retention period is mea-
                     sured. Currently, only DAYS is supported.

              LockState -> (string)
                 The lock state for the retention rule.

                 o locked - The retention rule is locked and can't be modified
                   or deleted.

                 o pending_unlock  -  The retention rule has been unlocked but
                   it is still within the unlock delay period.  The  retention
                   rule can be modified or deleted only after the unlock delay
                   period has expired.

                 o unlocked - The retention rule is unlocked  and  it  can  be
                   modified  or  deleted by any user with the required permis-
                   sions.

                 o null - The retention rule has never been locked. Once a re-
                   tention rule has been locked, it can transition between the
                   locked and unlocked states only; it  can  never  transition
                   back to null .

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
