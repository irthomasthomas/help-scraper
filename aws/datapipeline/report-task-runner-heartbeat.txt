REPORT-TASK-RUNNER-HEARTBEAT()                  REPORT-TASK-RUNNER-HEARTBEAT()



NAME
       report-task-runner-heartbeat -

DESCRIPTION
       Task  runners  call ReportTaskRunnerHeartbeat every 15 minutes to indi-
       cate that they are operational. If the AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner is
       launched  on  a  resource managed by AWS Data Pipeline, the web service
       can use this call to detect when the task runner application has failed
       and restart a new instance.

OPTIONS
       --taskrunner-id (string)
          The  ID  of the task runner. This value should be unique across your
          AWS account. In the case of AWS Data Pipeline Task  Runner  launched
          on a resource managed by AWS Data Pipeline, the web service provides
          a unique identifier when it launches the application.  If  you  have
          written  a custom task runner, you should assign a unique identifier
          for the task runner.

       --worker-group (string)
          The type of task  the  task  runner  is  configured  to  accept  and
          process.  The worker group is set as a field on objects in the pipe-
          line when they are created. You can only specify a single value  for
          workerGroup  . There are no wildcard values permitted in workerGroup
          ; the string must be an exact, case-sensitive, match.

       --hostname (string)
          The public DNS name of the task runner.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       terminate -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether the calling task runner should terminate.
