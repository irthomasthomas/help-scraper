REPORT-TASK-PROGRESS()                                  REPORT-TASK-PROGRESS()



NAME
       report-task-progress -

DESCRIPTION
       Task  runners  call ReportTaskProgress when assigned a task to acknowl-
       edge that it has the task. If the web service does not receive this ac-
       knowledgement  within  2  minutes,  it assigns the task in a subsequent
       PollForTask call. After this initial acknowledgement, the  task  runner
       only  needs  to report progress every 15 minutes to maintain its owner-
       ship of the task. You can change this reporting time from 15 minutes by
       specifying a reportProgressTimeout field in your pipeline.

       If  a  task runner does not report its status after 5 minutes, AWS Data
       Pipeline assumes that the task runner is unable to process the task and
       reassigns the task in a subsequent response to  PollForTask . Task run-
       ners should call ReportTaskProgress every 60 seconds.

OPTIONS
       --task-id (string)
          The ID of the task assigned to the task runner. This value  is  pro-
          vided in the response for  PollForTask .

       --fields (list)
          Key-value  pairs  that  define  the properties of the ReportTaskPro-
          gressInput object.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair that describes a property of a pipeline object.
              The  value  is specified as either a string value (StringValue )
              or a reference to another object (RefValue ) but not as both.

              key -> (string)
                 The field identifier.

              stringValue -> (string)
                 The field value, expressed as a String.

              refValue -> (string)
                 The field value, expressed as the identifier of  another  ob-
                 ject.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,stringValue=string,refValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "stringValue": "string",
              "refValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       canceled -> (boolean)
          If  true,  the  calling  task runner should cancel processing of the
          task. The task runner does not need to call  SetTaskStatus for  can-
          celed tasks.
