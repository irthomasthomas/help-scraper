LIST-PIPELINES()                                              LIST-PIPELINES()



NAME
       list-pipelines -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  pipeline identifiers for all active pipelines that you have
       permission to access.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-pipelines is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: pipelineIdList

SYNOPSIS
            list-pipelines
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list your pipelines

       This example lists your pipelines:

          aws datapipeline list-pipelines

       The following is example output:

          {
            "pipelineIdList": [
                {
                    "id": "df-00627471SOVYZEXAMPLE",
                    "name": "my-pipeline"
                },
                {
                    "id": "df-09028963KNVMREXAMPLE",
                    "name": "ImportDDB"
                },
                {
                    "id": "df-0870198233ZYVEXAMPLE",
                    "name": "CrossRegionDDB"
                },
                {
                    "id": "df-00189603TB4MZEXAMPLE",
                    "name": "CopyRedshift"
                }
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       pipelineIdList -> (list)
          The pipeline identifiers.  If  you  require  additional  information
          about  the  pipelines,  you  can  use these identifiers to call  De-
          scribePipelines and  GetPipelineDefinition .

          (structure)
              Contains the name and identifier of a pipeline.

              id -> (string)
                 The ID of the pipeline that was assigned by  AWS  Data  Pipe-
                 line. This is a string of the form df-297EG78HU43EEXAMPLE .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the pipeline.

       marker -> (string)
          The  starting  point  for the next page of results. To view the next
          page of results, call ListPipelinesOutput  again  with  this  marker
          value. If the value is null, there are no more results.

       hasMoreResults -> (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  there are more results that can be obtained by a
          subsequent call.
