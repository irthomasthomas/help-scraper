DEACTIVATE-PIPELINE()                                    DEACTIVATE-PIPELINE()



NAME
       deactivate-pipeline -

DESCRIPTION
       Deactivates  the specified running pipeline. The pipeline is set to the
       DEACTIVATING state until the deactivation process completes.

       To resume a deactivated pipeline, use  ActivatePipeline .  By  default,
       the pipeline resumes from the last completed execution. Optionally, you
       can specify the date and time to resume the pipeline.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            deactivate-pipeline
          --pipeline-id <value>
          [--cancel-active | --no-cancel-active]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-id (string)
          The ID of the pipeline.

       --cancel-active | --no-cancel-active (boolean)
          Indicates whether to cancel any  running  objects.  The  default  is
          true,  which  sets the state of any running objects to CANCELED . If
          this value is false, the pipeline is deactivated after  all  running
          objects finish.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To deactivate a pipeline

       This example deactivates the specified pipeline:

          aws datapipeline deactivate-pipeline --pipeline-id df-00627471SOVYZEXAMPLE

       To  deactivate  the  pipeline only after all running activities finish,
       use the following command:

          aws datapipeline deactivate-pipeline --pipeline-id df-00627471SOVYZEXAMPLE --no-cancel-active

OUTPUT
       None
