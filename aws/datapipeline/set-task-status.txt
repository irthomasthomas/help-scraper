SET-TASK-STATUS()                                            SET-TASK-STATUS()



NAME
       set-task-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Task runners call SetTaskStatus to notify AWS Data Pipeline that a task
       is completed and provide information about the  final  status.  A  task
       runner  makes this call regardless of whether the task was sucessful. A
       task runner does not need to call SetTaskStatus for tasks that are can-
       celed by the web service during a call to  ReportTaskProgress .

OPTIONS
       --task-id (string)
          The  ID  of the task assigned to the task runner. This value is pro-
          vided in the response for  PollForTask .

       --task-status (string)
          If FINISHED , the task successfully completed. If FAILED , the  task
          ended unsuccessfully. Preconditions use false.

          Possible values:

          o FINISHED

          o FAILED

          o FALSE

       --error-id (string)
          If an error occurred during the task, this value specifies the error
          code. This value is set on the physical attempt object. It  is  used
          to  display  error information to the user. It should not start with
          string "
          Service_
          " which is reserved by the system.

       --error-message (string)
          If an error occurred during the task, this value  specifies  a  text
          description  of the error. This value is set on the physical attempt
          object. It is used to display error information to the user. The web
          service does not parse this value.

       --error-stack-trace (string)
          If an error occurred during the task, this value specifies the stack
          trace associated with the error. This value is set on  the  physical
          attempt object. It is used to display error information to the user.
          The web service does not parse this value.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
