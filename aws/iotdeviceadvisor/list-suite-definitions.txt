OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return at once.

       --next-token (string)
          A token used to get the next set of results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To list the IoT Device Advisor test suites you created

       The  following list-suite-definitions example lists up to 25 device ad-
       visor test suites you created in AWS IoT. If you have more than 25 test
       suites,  the  "nextToken" will be shown in the output. You can use this
       "nextToken" to show the rest of the test suites you created.

          aws iotdeviceadvisor list-suite-definitions

       Output:

          {
              "suiteDefinitionInformationList": [
                  {
                      "suiteDefinitionId": "3hsn88h4p2g5",
                      "suiteDefinitionName": "TestSuite1",
                      "defaultDevices": [
                          {
                              "thingArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:thing/MyIotThing"
                          }
                      ],
                      "intendedForQualification": false,
                      "isLongDurationTest": false,
                      "protocol": "MqttV3_1_1",
                      "createdAt": "2022-11-17T14:15:56.830000-05:00"
                  },
                  {
                      ......
                  }
              ],
              "nextToken": "nextTokenValue"
          }

       Example 2: To list the IoT Device Advisor test suites you created  with
       the specified settings

       The  following list-suite-definitions example lists device advisor test
       suites you created in AWS IoT with the specified max-result number.  If
       you  have more test suites than the max number, the "nextToken" will be
       shown in the output. If you have "nextToken", you can  use  "nextToken"
       to show the test suites you created that weren't shown before.

          aws iotdeviceadvisor list-suite-definitions \
              --max-result 1 \
              --next-token "nextTokenValue"

       Output:

          {
              "suiteDefinitionInformationList": [
                  {
                      "suiteDefinitionId": "ztvb5aew4w4x",
                      "suiteDefinitionName": "TestSuite2",
                      "defaultDevices": [],
                      "intendedForQualification": true,
                      "isLongDurationTest": false,
                      "protocol": "MqttV3_1_1",
                      "createdAt": "2022-11-17T14:15:56.830000-05:00"
                  }
              ],
              "nextToken": "nextTokenValue"
          }
