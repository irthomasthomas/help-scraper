OPTIONS
       --knowledge-base-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the knowledge base. Can be either the ID or the
          ARN. URLs cannot contain the ARN.

       --message-template-id (string)
          The identifier of the message template. Can be either the ID or  the
          ARN.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                        ommend using HTML format for email clients that render
                        HTML content. You can include links,  formatted  text,
                        and more in an HTML message.

                        that  don't  render  HTML content and clients that are
                        connected to high-latency networks, such as mobile de-
                        vices.
