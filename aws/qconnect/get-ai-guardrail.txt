OPTIONS
       --ai-guardrail-id (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Q in Connect AI Guardrail.

       --assistant-id (string)
          The  identifier  of the Amazon Q in Connect assistant. Can be either
          the ID or the ARN. URLs cannot contain the ARN.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                 (structure)
                     Contains  filter  strengths  for  harmful   content.   AI
                     Guardrail's  support the following content filters to de-
                     tect and filter harmful user inputs and FM-generated out-
                     puts.

                     o Hate : Describes input prompts and model responses that
                       discriminate, criticize, insult, denounce, or  dehuman-
                       ize a person or group on the basis of an identity (such
                       as race, ethnicity, gender, religion,  sexual  orienta-
                       tion, ability, and national origin).

                     o Insults  :  Describes input prompts and model responses
                       that includes demeaning, humiliating, mocking,  insult-
                       ing,  or  belittling language. This type of language is
                       also labeled as bullying.

                     o Sexual : Describes input prompts  and  model  responses
                       that  indicates  sexual  interest, activity, or arousal
                       using direct or  indirect  references  to  body  parts,
                       physical traits, or sex.

                     o Violence  : Describes input prompts and model responses
                       that includes glorification of, or threats  to  inflict
                       physical  pain, hurt, or injury toward a person, group,
                       or thing.

                     Content filtering depends on the  confidence  classifica-
                     tion  of  user inputs and FM responses across each of the
                     four harmful categories. All input and output  statements
                     are  classified into one of four confidence levels (NONE,
                     LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) for each harmful category.  For  exam-
                     ple,  if a statement is classified as Hate with HIGH con-
                     fidence, the likelihood  of  the  statement  representing
                     hateful  content is high. A single statement can be clas-
                     sified across multiple categories with varying confidence
                     levels. For example, a single statement can be classified
                     as Hate with HIGH confidence,  Insults  with  LOW  confi-
                     dence,  Sexual  with  NONE  confidence, and Violence with
                     MEDIUM confidence.

                     inputStrength -> (string)
                        The  strength  of  the  content  filter  to  apply  to
                        prompts.  As  you  increase  the  filter strength, the
                        likelihood of filtering harmful content increases  and
                        the  probability of seeing harmful content in your ap-
                        plication reduces.

                     outputStrength -> (string)
                        The strength of the content filter to apply  to  model
                        responses.  As  you  increase the filter strength, the
                        likelihood of filtering harmful content increases  and
                        the  probability of seeing harmful content in your ap-
                        plication reduces.

                     type -> (string)
                        The harmful category that the content  filter  is  ap-
                        plied to.

                        The following PIIs are used to block or mask sensitive
                        information:

                        o General

                          o ADDRESS   A physical address, such  as  "100  Main
                            Street,  Anytown,  USA"  or  "Suite  #12, Building
                            123". An address can include information  such  as
                            the street, building, location, city, state, coun-
                            try, county, zip code, precinct, and neighborhood.

                          o AGE   An individual's age, including the  quantity
                            and unit of time. For example, in the phrase "I am
                            40 years old," Guarrails recognizes "40 years"  as
                            an age.

                          o NAME   An individual's name. This entity type does
                            not include titles, such as  Dr.,  Mr.,  Mrs.,  or
                            Miss.  AI Guardrail doesn't apply this entity type
                            to names that are part  of  organizations  or  ad-
                            dresses.  For example, AI Guardrail recognizes the
                            "John Doe Organization" as an organization, and it
                            recognizes "Jane Doe Street" as an address.

                          o EMAIL     An   email   address,  such  as  maryma-

                            cles  on  a public road. A driver's license number
                            consists of alphanumeric characters.

                          o LICENSE_PLATE   A license plate for a  vehicle  is

                            is  typically  five to eight digits, consisting of
                            upper-case letters and numbers. The format  varies
                            depending  on the location of the issuing state or
                            country.

                          o VEHICLE_IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER   A Vehicle  Identi-

                            American Express credit or debit cards, the CVV is
                            a four-digit numeric code.

                          o CREDIT_DEBIT_CARD_EXPIRY   The expiration date for
                            a  credit  or  debit  card. This number is usually
                            four  digits  long  and  is  often  formatted   as
                            month/year  or MM/YY . AI Guardrail recognizes ex-
                            piration dates such as 01/21 , 01/2021 ,  and  Jan
                            2021 .

                            money transfers such as international wire  trans-
                            fers.  SWIFT  codes consist of eight or 11 charac-
                            ters.  The  11-digit  codes  refer   to   specific
                            branches,  while  eight-digit  codes  (or 11-digit
                            codes ending in 'XXX') refer to the head  or  pri-
