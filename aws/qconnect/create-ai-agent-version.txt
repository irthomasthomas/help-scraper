OPTIONS
       --ai-agent-id (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Q in Connect AI Agent.

       --assistant-id (string)
          The  identifier  of the Amazon Q in Connect assistant. Can be either
          the ID or the ARN. URLs cannot contain the ARN.

       --client-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotency  of  the request. If not provided, the AWS SDK populates
          this field. For more information about idempotency, see  Making  re-
          tries safe with idempotent APIs .

       --modified-time (timestamp)
          The  modification time of the AI Agent should be tracked for version
          creation. This field should be specified to avoid  version  creation
          when  simultaneous  update  to the underlying AI Agent are possible.
          The value should be the modifiedTime returned from  the  request  to
          create or update an AI Agent so that version creation can fail if an
          update to the AI Agent post the specified modification time has been
          made.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
