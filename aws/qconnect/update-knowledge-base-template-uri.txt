NAME
       update-knowledge-base-template-uri -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  template  URI of a knowledge base. This is only supported
       for knowledge bases of type EXTERNAL.  Include  a  single  variable  in
       ${variable}  format; this interpolated by Amazon Q in Connect using in-
       gested content. For example, if you ingest a Salesforce article, it has
       an  Id  value,  and you can set the template URI to https://myInstance-
       Name.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Knowledge__kav/*${Id}*/view .

OPTIONS
       --knowledge-base-id (string)
          The identifier of the knowledge base. This should not be a QUICK_RE-
          SPONSES  type  knowledge base. Can be either the ID or the ARN. URLs
          cannot contain the ARN.

       --template-uri (string)
          The template URI to update.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                     data.  If  you  opt  for  NONE  ,  then  you  may want to

                     Settings for hierarchical document chunking  for  a  data
                     source.  Hierarchical chunking splits documents into lay-
                     ers of  chunks  where  the  first  layer  contains  large
                     chunks,  and the second layer contains smaller chunks de-
                     rived from the first layer.

                     Settings  for  semantic  document  chunking  for  a  data
                     source.  Semantic chunking splits a document into smaller
                     documents based on groups of similar content derived from
                     the text with natural language processing.
