QUERY-ASSISTANT()                                            QUERY-ASSISTANT()



NAME
       query-assistant -

DESCRIPTION
       Performs  a  manual search against the specified assistant. To retrieve
       recommendations for an assistant, use GetRecommendations .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       query-assistant is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: results

OPTIONS
       --assistant-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the Amazon Q assistant. Can be either the ID or
          the ARN. URLs cannot contain the ARN.

       --query-condition (list)
          Information about how to query content.

          (tagged union structure)
              Information about how to query content.

              NOTE:
                 This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of  the  following
                 top level keys can be set: single.

              single -> (structure)
                 The condition for the query.

                 comparator -> (string)
                     The comparison operator for query condition to query on.

                 field -> (string)
                     The name of the field for query condition to query on.

                 value -> (string)
                     The value for the query condition to query on.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          single={comparator=string,field=string,value=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "single": {
                "comparator": "EQUALS",
                "field": "RESULT_TYPE",
                "value": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --query-text (string)
          The text to search for.

       --session-id (string)
          The  identifier of the Amazon Q session. Can be either the ID or the
          ARN. URLs cannot contain the ARN.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
