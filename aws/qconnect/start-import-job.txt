START-IMPORT-JOB()                                          START-IMPORT-JOB()



NAME
       start-import-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Start  an asynchronous job to import Amazon Q in Connect resources from
       an   uploaded   source   file.   Before   calling   this    API,    use
       StartContentUpload to upload an asset that contains the resource data.

       o For importing Amazon Q in Connect quick responses, you need to upload
         a csv file including the quick responses. For information  about  how
         to  format  the  csv  file  for importing quick responses, see Import
         quick responses .

          source data are imported from.

          configuration -> (tagged union structure)
              The configuration information of the external data source.

              NOTE:
                 This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of  the  following
                 top level keys can be set: connectConfiguration.

              connectConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  configuration  information  of  the  Amazon Connect data
                 source.

                 instanceId -> (string)
                     The identifier of the Amazon Connect  instance.  You  can
                     find the instanceId in the ARN of the instance.

          source -> (string)
              The type of the external data source.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          configuration={connectConfiguration={instanceId=string}},source=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "configuration": {
              "connectConfiguration": {
                "instanceId": "string"
              }
            },

          }

       --import-job-type (string)
          The type of the import job.

          o For  importing quick response resource, set the value to QUICK_RE-
            SPONSES .

          Possible values:

          o QUICK_RESPONSES

       --knowledge-base-id (string)
          The identifier of the knowledge base. Can be either the  ID  or  the
          ARN. URLs cannot contain the ARN.

          o For  importing Amazon Q in Connect quick responses, this should be
            a QUICK_RESPONSES type knowledge base.

       --metadata (map)
          The metadata fields of the imported Amazon Q in Connect resources.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

          StartContentUpload .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
