DESCRIPTION
       Uploads an attachment file to the specified Amazon Q in Connect message
       template. The name of the message template attachment has to be  unique
       for each message template referenced by the $LATEST qualifier. The body
       of the attachment file should be encoded using base64  encoding.  After
       the file is uploaded, you can use the pre-signed Amazon S3 URL returned
       in response to download the uploaded file.

OPTIONS
       --body (string)
          The body of the attachment file being uploaded. It should be encoded
          using base64 encoding.

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. If not provided, the Amazon Web Services
          SDK  populates  this  field. For more information about idempotency,
          see Making retries safe with idempotent APIs .

       --content-disposition (string)
          The presentation information for the attachment file.

          Possible values:

          o ATTACHMENT

       --knowledge-base-id (string)
          The identifier of the knowledge base. Can be either the  ID  or  the
          ARN. URLs cannot contain the ARN.

       --message-template-id (string)
          The  identifier of the message template. Can be either the ID or the
          ARN. It cannot contain any qualifier.

       --name (string)
          The name of the attachment file being uploaded. The name should  in-
          clude the file extension.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)
