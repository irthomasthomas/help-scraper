NAME
       render-message-template -

DESCRIPTION
       Renders the Amazon Q in Connect message template based on the attribute
       values provided and generates the message  content.  For  any  variable
       present in the message template, if the attribute value is neither pro-
       vided in the attribute request parameter nor the default  attribute  of
       the  message template, the rendered message content will keep the vari-
       able placeholder as it is and return the attribute keys that are  miss-
       ing.

                     sages that are based on the message template.  We  recom-

                     in an HTML message.

                     ommend using plain text format  for  email  clients  that
