CREATE-CONTENT-ASSOCIATION()                      CREATE-CONTENT-ASSOCIATION()



NAME
       create-content-association -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  association between a content resource in a knowledge base
       and step-by-step guides . Step-by-step  guides  offer  instructions  to
       agents for resolving common customer issues. You create a content asso-
       ciation to integrate Amazon Q in Connect and step-by-step guides.

       After you integrate Amazon Q and step-by-step  guides,  when  Amazon  Q
       provides a recommendation to an agent based on the intent that it's de-
       tected, it also provides them with the option to start the step-by-step
       guide that you have associated with the content.

       Note the following limitations:

       o You can create only one content association for each content resource
         in a knowledge base.

       o You can associate a step-by-step  guide  with  multiple  content  re-
         sources.

       For   more   information,  see  Integrate  Amazon  Q  in  Connect  with
       step-by-step guides in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide .

OPTIONS
       --association (tagged union structure)
          The identifier of the associated resource.

          NOTE:
              This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following  top
              level keys can be set: amazonConnectGuideAssociation.

          amazonConnectGuideAssociation -> (structure)
              The data of the step-by-step guide association.

              flowId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of an Amazon Connect flow.
                 Step-by-step guides are a type of flow.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          amazonConnectGuideAssociation={flowId=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "amazonConnectGuideAssociation": {
              "flowId": "string"
            }
          }

       --association-type (string)
          The type of association.

          Possible values:

          o AMAZON_CONNECT_GUIDE

       --client-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request. If not provided, the Amazon Web Services
          SDK populates this field. For more  information  about  idempotency,
          see Making retries safe with idempotent APIs .

       --content-id (string)
          The identifier of the content.

       --knowledge-base-id (string)
          The identifier of the knowledge base.

       --tags (map)
          The  tags  used  to  organize, track, or control access for this re-
          source.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.
