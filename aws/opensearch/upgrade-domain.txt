OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          Name of the OpenSearch Service domain that you want to upgrade.

       --target-version (string)
          OpenSearch or Elasticsearch version to which you want to upgrade, in
          the format Opensearch_X.Y or Elasticsearch_X.Y.

       --perform-check-only | --no-perform-check-only (boolean)
          When true, indicates that an upgrade eligibility check needs  to  be
          performed. Does not actually perform the upgrade.

       --advanced-options (map)
          Only  supports  the override_main_response_version parameter and not
          other advanced options. You can only include this  option  when  up-
          grading  to  an OpenSearch version. Specifies whether the domain re-
          ports its version as 7.10 so that it continues to work with Elastic-
          search OSS clients and plugins.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
