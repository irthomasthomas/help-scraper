OPTIONS
       --reserved-instance-offering-id (string)
          The  offering  identifier  filter  value. Use this parameter to show

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON

       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
