          Unique identifier of the OpenSearch Application to be updated.

       --data-sources (list)
          Data sources to be associated with the OpenSearch Application.

          (structure)
              Data sources that are associated with an OpenSearch Application.

              dataSourceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the domain. See Identifiers
                 for IAM Entities in Using Amazon Web  Services  Identity  and

              dataSourceDescription -> (string)
                 Detailed description of a data source.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          dataSourceArn=string,dataSourceDescription=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "dataSourceArn": "string",
              "dataSourceDescription": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --app-configs (list)
          Configurations to be changed for the OpenSearch Application.

          (structure)
              Configurations of the OpenSearch Application.

              key -> (string)
                 Specify  the  item  to  configure, such as admin role for the
                 OpenSearch Application.

              value -> (string)
                 Specifies the value to configure for the key, such as an  IAM
                 user ARN.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "opensearchDashboards.dashboardAdmin.users"|"opensearchDashboards.dashboardAdmin.groups",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.
