              ValueList -> (list)
                     ListEntities - This is a list of unique EntityId s.

                     ListChangeSets - The supported filter names  and  associ-
                     ated ValueList s is as follows:

                 o ChangeSetName  -  The  supported  ValueList  is  a  list of
                   non-unique ChangeSetName s. These are defined when you call
                   the StartChangeSet action.

                 o Status  - The supported ValueList is a list of statuses for

                   tityId s.

                 o BeforeStartTime  - The supported ValueList is a list of all
                   change sets that started before the filter value.

                 o AfterStartTime - The supported ValueList is a list  of  all
                   change sets that started after the filter value.

                 o BeforeEndTime  -  The  supported ValueList is a list of all
                   change sets that ended before the filter value.

                 o AfterEndTime - The supported ValueList is  a  list  of  all
                   change sets that ended after the filter value.

                 (string)

          Name=string,ValueList=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "ValueList": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sort (structure)
          An object that contains two attributes, SortBy and SortOrder .

          SortBy -> (string)
              For ListEntities , supported attributes include LastModifiedDate
              (default), Visibility , EntityId , and Name .

              For ListChangeSets , supported attributes include StartTime  and
              EndTime .

          SortOrder -> (string)
              The  sorting order. Can be ASCENDING or DESCENDING . The default
              value is DESCENDING .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SortBy=string,SortOrder=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SortBy": "string",
            "SortOrder": "ASCENDING"|"DESCENDING"
          }

       --next-token (string)
          The value of the next token, if it exists. Null if there are no more
          results.

       --max-results (integer)

       --ownership-type (string)
          Possible values:

          o SELF

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
