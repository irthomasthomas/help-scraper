LIST-CHANGE-SETS()                                          LIST-CHANGE-SETS()



NAME
       list-change-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the list of change sets owned by the account being used to make
       the call. You can filter this list by providing any combination of  en-
       tityId  , ChangeSetName , and status. If you provide more than one fil-
       ter, the API operation applies a logical AND between the filters.

       You can describe a change during the 60-day request  history  retention
       period for API calls.

          (structure)
              A filter object, used to optionally filter results from calls to
              the ListEntities and ListChangeSets actions.

              Name -> (string)
                 For ListEntities , the supported value for this is  an  Enti-
                 tyId .

                 For ListChangeSets , the supported values are as follows:

              ValueList -> (list)
                     ListEntities - This is a list of unique EntityId s.

                     ListChangeSets  -  The supported filter names and associ-
                     ated ValueList s is as follows:

                 o ChangeSetName -  The  supported  ValueList  is  a  list  of
                   non-unique ChangeSetName s. These are defined when you call
                   the StartChangeSet action.

                 o Status - The supported ValueList is a list of statuses  for
                   all change set requests.

                 o EntityId  - The supported ValueList is a list of unique En-
                   tityId s.

                 o BeforeStartTime - The supported ValueList is a list of  all
                   change sets that started before the filter value.

                 o AfterStartTime  -  The supported ValueList is a list of all
                   change sets that started after the filter value.

                 o BeforeEndTime - The supported ValueList is a  list  of  all
                   change sets that ended before the filter value.

                 o AfterEndTime  -  The  supported  ValueList is a list of all
                   change sets that ended after the filter value.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,ValueList=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "ValueList": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sort (structure)
          An object that contains two attributes, SortBy and SortOrder .

          SortBy -> (string)
              For ListEntities , supported attributes include LastModifiedDate
              (default), Visibility , EntityId , and Name .

              For  ListChangeSets , supported attributes include StartTime and
              EndTime .

          SortOrder -> (string)
              The sorting order. Can be ASCENDING or DESCENDING . The  default
              value is DESCENDING .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SortBy=string,SortOrder=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SortBy": "string",
            "SortOrder": "ASCENDING"|"DESCENDING"
          }

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of results returned by a single call. This value
          must be provided in the next call to retrieve the next  set  of  re-
          sults. By default, this value is 20.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  value  retrieved from a previous call to access the next
          page of results.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
