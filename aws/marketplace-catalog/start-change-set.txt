START-CHANGE-SET()                                          START-CHANGE-SET()



NAME
       start-change-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Allows  you  to  request  changes  for  your  entities. Within a single
       ChangeSet , you can't start the same change type against the  same  en-
       tity multiple times. Additionally, when a ChangeSet is running, all the
       entities targeted by the different changes are locked until the  change
       set  has completed (either succeeded, cancelled, or failed). If you try
       to start a change set containing a change against an entity that is al-
       ready locked, you will receive a ResourceInUseException error.

       For  example,  you  can't  start the ChangeSet described in the example
       later in this topic because it contains two changes  to  run  the  same
       change type (AddRevisions ) against the same entity (entity-id@1 ).

       For  more  information about working with change sets, see Working with
       change sets . For information about change types for  single-AMI  prod-
       ucts, see Working with single-AMI products . Also, for more information
       about change types available for container-based products, see  Working
       with container products .

       start-change-set  uses  document type values. Document types follow the
       JSON data model where valid values  are:  strings,  numbers,  booleans,
       null, arrays, and objects. For command input, options and nested param-
       eters that are labeled with the type document must be provided as JSON.
       Shorthand syntax does not support document types.

OPTIONS
       --catalog (string)
          The catalog related to the request. Fixed value: AWSMarketplace

       --change-set (list)
          Array of change object.

          (structure)

              ChangeType -> (string)
                 Change  types are single string values that describe your in-
                 tention for the change. Each change type is unique  for  each
                 EntityType  provided in the change's scope. For more informa-
                 tion about change types available  for  single-AMI  products,
                 see  Working with single-AMI products . Also, for more infor-
                 mation about change types available for container-based prod-
                 ucts, see Working with container products .

              Details -> (string)
                 This  object  contains details specific to the change type of
                 the requested change. For more information about change types
                 available  for  single-AMI  products,  see  Working with sin-
                 gle-AMI products . Also, for more  information  about  change

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
