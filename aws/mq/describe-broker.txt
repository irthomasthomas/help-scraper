OPTIONS
       --broker-id (string)
          The unique ID that Amazon MQ generates for the broker.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

              tree (DIT) to search for roles or groups. For example, ou=group,

              tribute in the object returned from the group membership query.

          RoleSearchMatching -> (string)

              The distinguished name of the user matched by userSearchMatching
              is  substituted  into  the {0} placeholder in the search filter.
              The client's username is substituted into the  {1}  placeholder.
              For  example,  if you set this option to (member=uid={1})for the
              user janedoe, the search filter becomes (member=uid=janedoe) af-
              ter string substitution. It matches all role entries that have a
              member attribute equal to uid=janedoe under the subtree selected
              by the roleBase.

          RoleSearchSubtree -> (boolean)

              by setting this option to ou=Users,ou=corp, dc=corp, dc=example,
              dc=com, the search for user entries is restricted to the subtree
              beneath ou=Users, ou=corp, dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.

              The client's username is substituted into the {0} placeholder in
              the search filter.  For  example,  if  this  option  is  set  to
              (uid={0})  and the received username is janedoe, the search fil-
              ter becomes (uid=janedoe) after string substitution. It will re-
              sult  in  matching  an entry like uid=janedoe, ou=Users,ou=corp,
              dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.

          UserSearchSubtree -> (boolean)

          be deployed for the specified broker.

                 Enables audit logging. Every user management action made  us-
                 ing JMX or the ActiveMQ Web Console is logged.

              ou=corp, dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.

          RoleName -> (string)
              Specifies the LDAP attribute that identifies the group name  at-
              tribute in the object returned from the group membership query.

          RoleSearchMatching -> (string)
              The  LDAP  search filter used to find roles within the roleBase.
              The distinguished name of the user matched by userSearchMatching
              is  substituted  into  the {0} placeholder in the search filter.
              The client's username is substituted into the  {1}  placeholder.
              For  example,  if you set this option to (member=uid={1})for the
              user janedoe, the search filter becomes (member=uid=janedoe) af-
              ter string substitution. It matches all role entries that have a

              (DIT)  to search for user entries. The subtree is specified by a

              by setting this option to ou=Users,ou=corp, dc=corp, dc=example,
              dc=com, the search for user entries is restricted to the subtree
