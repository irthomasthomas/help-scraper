DESCRIBE-CASES()                                              DESCRIBE-CASES()



NAME
       describe-cases -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of cases that you specify by passing one or more case
       IDs. You can use the afterTime and beforeTime parameters to filter  the
       cases  by date. You can set values for the includeResolvedCases and in-
       cludeCommunications parameters to specify how much information  to  re-
       turn.

       The response returns the following in JSON format:

       o One or more CaseDetails data types.

       o One or more nextToken values, which specify where to paginate the re-
         turned records represented by the CaseDetails objects.

       Case data is available for 12 months after creation. If a case was cre-
       ated more than 12 months ago, a request might return an error.

       NOTE:

          o You  must  have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API  from  an  account
            that  doesn't  have  a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise
            Support plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException error message  ap-
            pears.  For  information  about  changing  your  support plan, see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

       describe-cases is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: cases

OPTIONS
       --case-id-list (list)
          A  list  of  ID  numbers of the support cases you want returned. The
          maximum number of cases is 100.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --display-id (string)
          The ID displayed for a case in the Amazon Web Services Support  Cen-
          ter user interface.

       --after-time (string)
          The start date for a filtered date search on support case communica-
          tions. Case communications are available for 12  months  after  cre-
          ation.

       --before-time (string)
          The  end  date for a filtered date search on support case communica-
          tions. Case communications are available for 12  months  after  cre-
          ation.

       --include-resolved-cases | --no-include-resolved-cases (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  to  include  resolved  support  cases in the De-
          scribeCases response. By default, resolved cases aren't included.

       --language (string)
          The language in which Amazon Web Services Support handles the  case.
          Amazon  Web  Services  Support currently supports English ("en") and
          Japanese ("ja"). You must specify the ISO 639-1 code  for  the  lan-
          guage parameter if you want support in that language.

       --include-communications | --no-include-communications (boolean)
          Specifies whether to include communications in the DescribeCases re-
          sponse. By default, communications are included.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe a case

       The  following  describe-cases  example  returns  information about the
       specified support case in your AWS account.

                               eration.
