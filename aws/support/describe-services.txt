DESCRIBE-SERVICES()                                        DESCRIBE-SERVICES()



NAME
       describe-services -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the current list of Amazon Web Services services and a list of
       service categories for each service. You then  use  service  names  and
       categories  in your  CreateCase requests. Each Amazon Web Services ser-
       vice has its own set of categories.

       The service codes and category codes correspond to the values that  ap-
       pear  in the Service and Category lists on the Amazon Web Services Sup-
       port Center Create Case page. The values in those fields  don't  neces-
       sarily  match  the  service  codes  and  categories returned by the De-
       scribeServices operation. Always use the service codes  and  categories
       that  the DescribeServices operation returns, so that you have the most
       recent set of service and category codes.

       NOTE:

          o You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or  Enterprise  Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If  you  call  the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account
            that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise  On-Ramp,  or  Enterprise
            Support  plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException error message ap-
            pears. For information  about  changing  your  support  plan,  see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

OPTIONS
       --service-code-list (list)
          A JSON-formatted list of service codes available for Amazon Web Ser-
          vices services.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --language (string)
          The language in which Amazon Web Services Support handles the  case.
          Amazon Web Services Support currently supports Chinese (zh), English
          ("en"), Japanese ("ja") and Korean (ko). You must  specify  the  ISO
          639-1  code  for  the language parameter if you want support in that
          language.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       categories for requesting general information.
