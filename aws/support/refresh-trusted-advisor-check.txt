REFRESH-TRUSTED-ADVISOR-CHECK()                REFRESH-TRUSTED-ADVISOR-CHECK()



NAME
       refresh-trusted-advisor-check -

DESCRIPTION
       Refreshes  the  Trusted  Advisor check that you specify using the check
       ID. You can get the check IDs by calling  the   DescribeTrustedAdvisor-
       Checks operation.

       NOTE:
          Some  checks  are  refreshed  automatically.  If  you  call  the Re-
          freshTrustedAdvisorCheck operation to refresh them,  you  might  see
          the InvalidParameterValue error.

       The response contains a  TrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatus object.

       NOTE:

          o You  must  have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API  from  an  account
            that  does  not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise
            Support plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException error message  ap-
            pears.  For  information  about  changing  your  support plan, see

SYNOPSIS
            refresh-trusted-advisor-check
          --check-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --check-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the Trusted Advisor check to refresh.

          NOTE:
              Specifying the check ID of a check  that  is  automatically  re-
              freshed causes an InvalidParameterValue error.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
