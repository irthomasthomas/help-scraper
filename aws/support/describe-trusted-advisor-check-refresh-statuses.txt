NAME
       describe-trusted-advisor-check-refresh-statuses -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the refresh status of the Trusted Advisor checks that have the
       specified check IDs. You can get the check IDs by calling the   Descri-
       beTrustedAdvisorChecks operation.

       Some checks are refreshed automatically, and you can't return their re-
       fresh statuses by using the  DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses
       operation.  If  you call this operation for these checks, you might see
       an InvalidParameterValue error.

       NOTE:

          o You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or  Enterprise  Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If  you  call  the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account
            that does not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp,  or  Enterprise
            Support  plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException error message ap-
            pears. For information  about  changing  your  support  plan,  see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

SYNOPSIS
            describe-trusted-advisor-check-refresh-statuses
          --check-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --check-ids (list)
          The IDs of the Trusted Advisor checks to get the status.

          NOTE:
              If you specify the check ID of a check that is automatically re-
              freshed, you might see an InvalidParameterValue error.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the refresh statuses of AWS Trusted Advisor checks

       The following  describe-trusted-advisor-check-refresh-statuses  example
       lists  the  refresh  statuses for two Trusted Advisor checks: Amazon S3
       Bucket Permissions and IAM Use.

          aws support describe-trusted-advisor-check-refresh-statuses \
              --check-id "Pfx0RwqBli" "zXCkfM1nI3"

       Output:

          {
              "statuses": [
                  {
                      "checkId": "Pfx0RwqBli",
                      "status": "none",
                      "millisUntilNextRefreshable": 0
                  },
                  {
                      "checkId": "zXCkfM1nI3",
                      "status": "none",
                      "millisUntilNextRefreshable": 0
                  }
              ]
          }
