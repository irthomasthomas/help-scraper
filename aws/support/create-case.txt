CREATE-CASE()                                                    CREATE-CASE()



NAME
       create-case -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  case in the Amazon Web Services Support Center. This opera-
       tion is similar to how you create a case in  the  Amazon  Web  Services
       Support Center Create Case page.

       The  Amazon Web Services Support API doesn't support requesting service
       limit increases. You can submit a service limit increase in the follow-
       ing ways:

       o Submit  a  request from the Amazon Web Services Support Center Create
         Case page.

       o Use the Service Quotas RequestServiceQuotaIncrease operation.

       A successful CreateCase request returns an Amazon Web Services  Support
       case  number.  You can use the  DescribeCases operation and specify the
       case number to get existing Amazon Web Services  Support  cases.  After
       you create a case, use the  AddCommunicationToCase operation to add ad-
       ditional communication or attachments to an existing case.

       The caseId is separate from the displayId that appears  in  the  Amazon
       Web  Services  Support Center . Use the  DescribeCases operation to get
       the displayId .

       NOTE:

          o You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or  Enterprise  Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If  you  call  the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account
            that does not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp,  or  Enterprise
            Support  plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException error message ap-
            pears. For information  about  changing  your  support  plan,  see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

SYNOPSIS
            create-case
          --subject <value>
          [--service-code <value>]
          [--severity-code <value>]
          [--category-code <value>]
          --communication-body <value>
          [--cc-email-addresses <value>]
          [--language <value>]
          [--issue-type <value>]
          [--attachment-set-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subject (string)
          The  title  of  the  support  case. The title appears in the Subject
          field on the Amazon Web Services Support Center Create Case page.

       --service-code (string)
          The code for the Amazon Web Services service. You can use  the   De-
          scribeServices operation to get the possible serviceCode values.

       --severity-code (string)
          A  value  that  indicates the urgency of the case. This value deter-
          mines the response time according to your  service  level  agreement
          with  Amazon  Web  Services Support. You can use the  DescribeSever-
          ityLevels operation to get the possible values for severityCode .

          For more information, see  SeverityLevel and Choosing a Severity  in
          the Amazon Web Services Support User Guide .

          NOTE:
              The  availability of severity levels depends on the support plan
              for the Amazon Web Services account.

       --category-code (string)
          The category of problem for the support case. You also use the   De-
          scribeServices  operation  to  get  the category code for a service.
          Each Amazon Web Services service defines its  own  set  of  category
          codes.

       --communication-body (string)
          The  communication body text that describes the issue. This text ap-
          pears in the Description field on the Amazon  Web  Services  Support
          Center Create Case page.

       --cc-email-addresses (list)
          A list of email addresses that Amazon Web Services Support copies on
          case correspondence. Amazon Web Services Support identifies the  ac-
          count  that  creates  the case when you specify your Amazon Web Ser-
          vices credentials in an HTTP POST method or use the Amazon Web  Ser-
          vices SDKs .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --language (string)
          The  language in which Amazon Web Services Support handles the case.
          You must specify the ISO 639-1 code for the  language  parameter  if
          you want support in that language. Currently, English ("en") and Ja-
          panese ("ja") are supported.

       --issue-type (string)
          The type of issue for the case. You can specify customer-service  or
          technical . If you don't specify a value, the default is technical .

       --attachment-set-id (string)
          The  ID of a set of one or more attachments for the case. Create the
          set by using the  AddAttachmentsToSet operation.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a case

       The following create-case example creates a support case for  your  AWS
       account.

          aws support create-case \
              --category-code "using-aws" \
              --cc-email-addresses "myemail@example.com" \
              --communication-body "I want to learn more about an AWS service." \
              --issue-type "technical" \
              --language "en" \
              --service-code "general-info" \
              --severity-code "low" \
              --subject "Question about my account"

       Output:

          {
              "caseId": "case-12345678910-2013-c4c1d2bf33c5cf47"
          }

       For  more  information,  see  Case  management  in the AWS Support User
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       caseId -> (string)
          The support case ID requested or returned in the call. The  case  ID
          is    an    alphanumeric    string    in   the   following   format:
          case-12345678910-2013-c4c1d2bf33c5cf47



                                                                 CREATE-CASE()
