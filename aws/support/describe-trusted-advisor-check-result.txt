NAME
       describe-trusted-advisor-check-result -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the results of the Trusted Advisor check that has the specified
       check ID. You can get the check IDs by calling the   DescribeTrustedAd-
       visorChecks operation.

       The  response  contains a  TrustedAdvisorCheckResult object, which con-
       tains these three objects:

       o TrustedAdvisorCategorySpecificSummary

       o TrustedAdvisorResourceDetail

       o TrustedAdvisorResourcesSummary

       In addition, the response contains these fields:

       o status - The alert status of the check can  be  ok  (green),  warning
         (yellow), error (red), or not_available .

       o timestamp - The time of the last refresh of the check.

       o checkId - The unique identifier for the check.

       NOTE:

          o You  must  have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API  from  an  account
            that  doesn't  have  a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise
            Support plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException error message  ap-
            pears.  For  information  about  changing  your  support plan, see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

       To call the Trusted Advisor operations in the Amazon Web Services  Sup-
       port  API,  you must use the US East (N. Virginia) endpoint. Currently,
       the US West (Oregon) and Europe (Ireland) endpoints don't  support  the
       Trusted  Advisor operations. For more information, see About the Amazon
       Web Services Support API in the Amazon Web Services Support User  Guide
       .

          The ISO 639-1 code for the language that you want your check results
          to appear in.

          The Amazon Web Services Support API currently supports the following
          languages for Trusted Advisor:

          o Chinese, Simplified - zh

          o Chinese, Traditional - zh_TW

          o English - en

          o French - fr

          o Spanish - es

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
