DESCRIPTION
       Adds  additional  customer communication to an Amazon Web Services Sup-

       add communication. You can list a set of email addresses to copy on the
       communication by using the ccEmailAddresses parameter.  The  communica-
       tionBody value contains the text of the communication.

       NOTE:

            that  doesn't  have  a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise
            Support plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException error message  ap-
            pears.  For  information  about  changing  your  support plan, see

OPTIONS
       --case-id (string)
          The support case ID requested or returned in the call. The  case  ID
          is  an  alphanumeric  string  formatted  as  shown  in this example:
          case-12345678910-2013-c4c1d2bf33c5cf47

       --communication-body (string)
          The body of an email communication to add to the support case.

       --cc-email-addresses (list)
          The email addresses in the CC line of an email to be  added  to  the
          support case.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --attachment-set-id (string)
          The  ID of a set of one or more attachments for the communication to
          add to the case. Create the set by calling  AddAttachmentsToSet

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To add communication to a case

       The following add-communication-to-case example adds communications  to
       a support case in your AWS account.

          aws support add-communication-to-case \
              --case-id "case-12345678910-2013-c4c1d2bf33c5cf47" \
              --communication-body "I'm attaching a set of images to this case." \
              --cc-email-addresses "myemail@example.com" \
              --attachment-set-id "as-2f5a6faa2a4a1e600-mu-nk5xQlBr70-G1cUos5LZkd38KOAHZa9BMDVzNEXAMPLE"

       Output:

          {
              "result": true
          }

       For  more  information,  see  Case  management  in the AWS Support User
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       result -> (boolean)
          True if  AddCommunicationToCase succeeds. Otherwise, returns an  er-
          ror.
