            Support plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException error message  ap-

SYNOPSIS
            add-communication-to-case
          [--case-id <value>]
          --communication-body <value>
          [--cc-email-addresses <value>]
          [--attachment-set-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --case-id (string)
          The support case ID requested or returned in the call. The  case  ID
          is  an  alphanumeric  string  formatted  as  shown  in this example:
          case-12345678910-2013-c4c1d2bf33c5cf47

       --communication-body (string)
          The body of an email communication to add to the support case.

       --cc-email-addresses (list)
          The email addresses in the CC line of an email to be  added  to  the
          support case.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --attachment-set-id (string)
          The  ID of a set of one or more attachments for the communication to
          add to the case. Create the set by calling  AddAttachmentsToSet

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
