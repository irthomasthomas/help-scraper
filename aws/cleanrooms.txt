DESCRIPTION
       Welcome to the AWS Clean Rooms API Reference .

       AWS  Clean  Rooms is an AWS service that helps multiple parties to join
       their data together in a secure collaboration workspace. In the collab-
       oration,  members  who  can  query and receive results can get insights
       into the collective datasets without either party getting access to the
       other party's raw data.

       To  learn  more  about  AWS  Clean Rooms concepts, procedures, and best
       practices, see the AWS Clean Rooms User Guide .
