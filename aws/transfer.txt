NAME
       transfer -

DESCRIPTION
       Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables the transfer of
       files over the File Transfer Protocol  (FTP),  File  Transfer  Protocol
       over  SSL  (FTPS),  or Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)
       directly into and out of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon  S3)  or
       Amazon  EFS.  Additionally, you can use Applicability Statement 2 (AS2)
       to transfer files into and out of Amazon S3. Amazon Web Services  helps
       you  seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to Transfer Family
       by integrating with existing authentication systems, and providing  DNS
       routing  with Amazon Route 53 so nothing changes for your customers and
       partners, or their applications. With your data in Amazon S3,  you  can
       use it with Amazon Web Services services for processing, analytics, ma-
       chine learning, and archiving. Getting started with Transfer Family  is
       easy since there is no infrastructure to buy and set up.
