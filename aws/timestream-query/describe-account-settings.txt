NAME
       describe-account-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the settings for your account that include the query pricing
       model and the configured maximum TCUs the  service  can  use  for  your
       query workload.

       You're  charged  only  for  the duration of compute units used for your
       workloads.

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       MaxQueryTCU -> (integer)
          The maximum number of Timestream compute units  (TCUs)  the  service
          will use at any point in time to serve your queries. To run queries,
          you must set a minimum capacity of 4 TCU. You can  set  the  maximum
          number  of  TCU in multiples of 4, for example, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so
          on. This configuration is applicable only  for  on-demand  usage  of
          (TCUs).

       QueryPricingModel -> (string)
          The pricing model for queries in your account.

          NOTE:
              The  QueryPricingModel  parameter  is used by several Timestream
              operations; however,  the  UpdateAccountSettings  API  operation
              doesn't recognize any values other than COMPUTE_UNITS .

       QueryCompute -> (structure)
          An  object  that  contains the usage settings for Timestream Compute
          Units (TCUs) in your account for the query workload.

          ComputeMode -> (string)
              The mode in which Timestream Compute Units (TCUs) are  allocated
              and  utilized  within  an account. Note that in the Asia Pacific
              (Mumbai) region, the API operation  only  recognizes  the  value
              PROVISIONED .

          ProvisionedCapacity -> (structure)
              Configuration  object  that  contains  settings  for provisioned
              Timestream Compute Units (TCUs) in your account.

              ActiveQueryTCU -> (integer)
                 The number of Timestream Compute Units (TCUs) provisioned  in
                 the account. This field is only visible when the compute mode
                 is PROVISIONED .

              NotificationConfiguration -> (structure)
                 An object that contains settings for notifications  that  are
                 sent whenever the provisioned capacity settings are modified.
                 This field is only visible when the compute  mode  is  PROVI-
                 SIONED .

                 SnsConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Details  on  SNS  that are required to send the notifica-
                     tion.

                     TopicArn -> (string)
                        SNS topic ARN that the scheduled query status  notifi-
                        cations will be sent to.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that grants Timestream per-
                     mission to publish notifications. This field is only vis-
                     ible  if  SNS Topic is provided when updating the account
                     settings.

              LastUpdate -> (structure)
                 Information about the last update to the provisioned capacity
                 settings.

                 TargetQueryTCU -> (integer)
                     The  number  of TimeStream Compute Units (TCUs) requested
                     in the last account settings update.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The status of the last update. Can be  either  PENDING  ,
                     FAILED , or SUCCEEDED .

                 StatusMessage -> (string)
                     Error message describing the last account settings update
                     status, visible only if an error occurred.
