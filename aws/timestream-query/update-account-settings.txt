UPDATE-ACCOUNT-SETTINGS()                            UPDATE-ACCOUNT-SETTINGS()



NAME
       update-account-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       Transitions your account to use TCUs for query pricing and modifies the
       maximum query compute units that you've configured. If you  reduce  the
       value of MaxQueryTCU to a desired configuration, the new value can take
       up to 24 hours to be effective.

       NOTE:
          After you've transitioned your account to use TCUs for  query  pric-
          ing, you can't transition to using bytes scanned for query pricing.

OPTIONS
       --max-query-tcu (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  compute  units the service will use at any
          point in time to serve your queries. To run queries, you must set  a
          minimum  capacity of 4 TCU. You can set the maximum number of TCU in
          multiples of 4, for example, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so  on.  The  maximum
          value  supported  for MaxQueryTCU is 1000. To request an increase to
          this soft limit, contact Amazon Web Services Support.  For  informa-
          tion  about  the  default quota for maxQueryTCU, see Default quotas.
          This  configuration  is  applicable  only  for  on-demand  usage  of
          Timestream Compute Units (TCUs).

          The  maximum  value supported for MaxQueryTCU is 1000. To request an
          increase to this soft limit, contact Amazon  Web  Services  Support.
          For  information  about  the  default  quota  for  maxQueryTCU , see
          Default quotas .

       --query-pricing-model (string)
          The pricing model for queries in an account.

          NOTE:
              The QueryPricingModel parameter is used  by  several  Timestream
              operations;  however,  the  UpdateAccountSettings  API operation
              doesn't recognize any values other than COMPUTE_UNITS .

          Possible values:

          o BYTES_SCANNED

          o COMPUTE_UNITS

       --query-compute (structure)
          Modifies the query compute settings configured in your account,  in-
          cluding  the  query pricing model and provisioned Timestream Compute
          Units (TCUs) in your account.

          NOTE:
              This API is idempotent, meaning that  making  the  same  request
              multiple  times  will have the same effect as making the request
              once.

          ComputeMode -> (string)
              The mode in which Timestream Compute Units (TCUs) are  allocated
              and  utilized  within  an account. Note that in the Asia Pacific
              (Mumbai) region, the API operation  only  recognizes  the  value
              PROVISIONED .

          ProvisionedCapacity -> (structure)
              Configuration  object  that  contains  settings  for provisioned
              Timestream Compute Units (TCUs) in your account.

              TargetQueryTCU -> (integer)
                 The target compute capacity for querying data,  specified  in
                 Timestream Compute Units (TCUs).

              NotificationConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Configuration  settings for notifications related to the pro-
                 visioned capacity update.

                 SnsConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Details on SNS that are required to  send  the  notifica-
                     tion.

                     TopicArn -> (string)
                        SNS  topic ARN that the scheduled query status notifi-
                        cations will be sent to.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that grants Timestream per-
                     mission to publish notifications. This field is only vis-
                     ible if SNS Topic is provided when updating  the  account
                     settings.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ComputeMode": "ON_DEMAND"|"PROVISIONED",
            "ProvisionedCapacity": {
              "TargetQueryTCU": integer,
              "NotificationConfiguration": {
                "SnsConfiguration": {
                  "TopicArn": "string"
                },
                "RoleArn": "string"
              }
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
