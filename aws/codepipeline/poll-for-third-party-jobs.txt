NAME
       poll-for-third-party-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Determines  whether  there are any third party jobs for a job worker to
       act on. Used for partner actions only.

       WARNING:
          When this API is called, AWS CodePipeline returns temporary  creden-
          tials for the S3 bucket used to store artifacts for the pipeline, if
          the action requires access to that S3 bucket for input or output ar-
          tifacts.

OPTIONS
       --action-type-id (structure)
          Represents information about an action type.

          category -> (string)
              A  category  defines  what  kind  of  action can be taken in the
              stage, and constrains the provider type for  the  action.  Valid
              categories are limited to one of the following values.

              o Source

              o Build

              o Test

              o Deploy

              o Invoke

              o Approval

          owner -> (string)
              The  creator  of  the action being called. There are three valid
              values for the Owner field in the action category section within
              your  pipeline  structure:  AWS  , ThirdParty , and Custom . For
              more information, see Valid Action Types and Providers in  Code-
              Pipeline .

          provider -> (string)
              The  provider  of  the service being called by the action. Valid
              providers are determined by the action category. For example, an
              action  in the Deploy category type might have a provider of AWS
              CodeDeploy, which would be specified as CodeDeploy. For more in-
              formation,  see Valid Action Types and Providers in CodePipeline
              .

          version -> (string)
              A string that describes the action version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          category=string,owner=string,provider=string,version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "category": "Source"|"Build"|"Deploy"|"Test"|"Invoke"|"Approval",
            "owner": "AWS"|"ThirdParty"|"Custom",
            "provider": "string",
            "version": "string"
          }

       --max-batch-size (integer)
          The maximum number of jobs to return in a poll for jobs call.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       o on

       o off

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       jobs -> (list)
          Information about the jobs to take action on.

          (structure)
              A  response  to  a PollForThirdPartyJobs request returned by AWS
              CodePipeline when there is a job to be worked on  by  a  partner
              action.

              clientId -> (string)
                 The  clientToken portion of the clientId and clientToken pair
                 used to verify that the calling entity is allowed  access  to
                 the job and its details.

              jobId -> (string)
                 The identifier used to identify the job in AWS CodePipeline.
