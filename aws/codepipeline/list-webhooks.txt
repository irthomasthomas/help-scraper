LIST-WEBHOOKS()                                                LIST-WEBHOOKS()



NAME
       list-webhooks -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  listing of all the webhooks in this Amazon Web Services Region
       for this account. The output lists all webhooks and includes  the  web-
       hook URL and ARN and the configuration for each webhook.

       NOTE:
          If a secret token was provided, it will be redacted in the response.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-webhooks  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: webhooks

          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list webhooks

       The following list-webhooks example retrieves a list of  all  tags  at-
       tached to the specified pipeline resource.

          aws codepipeline list-webhooks \
              --endpoint-url "https://codepipeline.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com" \
              --region "eu-central-1"

       Output:

          {
              "webhooks": [
                  {
                      "url": "https://webhooks.domain.com/trigger111111111EXAMPLE11111111111111111": {
                          "authenticationConfiguration": {
                              "SecretToken": "Secret"
                          },
                          "name": "my-webhook",
                          "authentication": "GITHUB_HMAC",
                          "targetPipeline": "my-Pipeline",
                          "targetAction": "Source",
                          "filters": [
                              {
                                  "jsonPath": "$.ref",
                                  "matchEquals": "refs/heads/{Branch}"
                              }
                          ]
                      },
                      "arn": "arn:aws:codepipeline:eu-central-1:123456789012:webhook:my-webhook"
                  }
              ]
          }

          ListWebhooks call.

          (structure)
              The  detail  returned  for  each webhook after listing webhooks,
              such as the webhook URL, the webhook name, and the webhook ARN.

              definition -> (structure)
                 The detail returned for each webhook, such as the webhook au-
                 thentication type and filter rules.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the webhook.

                 targetPipeline -> (string)
                     The  name of the pipeline you want to connect to the web-
                     hook.

                 targetAction -> (string)
                     The name of the action in a pipeline you want to  connect
                     to  the  webhook.  The  action  must  be  from the source
                     (first) stage of the pipeline.

                 filters -> (list)
                     A list of rules applied to the body/payload sent  in  the
                     POST  request  to  a  webhook URL. All defined rules must
                     pass for the request to  be  accepted  and  the  pipeline
                     started.

                     (structure)
                        The event criteria that specify when a webhook notifi-
                        cation is sent to your URL.

                        jsonPath -> (string)
                            A JsonPath  expression  that  is  applied  to  the
                            body/payload of the webhook. The value selected by
                            the JsonPath expression must match the value spec-
                            ified in the MatchEquals field. Otherwise, the re-
                            quest is ignored. For more information,  see  Java
                            JsonPath implementation in GitHub.

                        matchEquals -> (string)
                            The value selected by the JsonPath expression must
                            match what is supplied in the  MatchEquals  field.
                            Otherwise, the request is ignored. Properties from
                            the target action configuration can be included as
                            placeholders  in this value by surrounding the ac-
                            tion configuration key with  curly  brackets.  For
                            example,   if   the   value   supplied   here   is
                            "refs/heads/{Branch}" and the target action has an
                            action configuration property called "Branch" with
                            a value of "main", the MatchEquals value is evalu-
                            ated  as  "refs/heads/main".  For a list of action
                            configuration  properties  for   built-in   action
                            types, see Pipeline Structure Reference Action Re-
                            quirements .

                 authentication -> (string)
                     Supported options are GITHUB_HMAC,  IP,  and  UNAUTHENTI-
                     CATED.

                     WARNING:
                        When  creating  CodePipeline webhooks, do not use your
                        own credentials or reuse the same secret token  across
                        multiple  webhooks.  For  optimal security, generate a
                        unique secret token for each webhook you  create.  The
                        secret  token is an arbitrary string that you provide,
                        which GitHub uses to compute and sign the webhook pay-
                        loads  sent to CodePipeline, for protecting the integ-
                        rity and authenticity of the webhook  payloads.  Using
                        your  own credentials or reusing the same token across
                        multiple webhooks can lead  to  security  vulnerabili-
                        ties.

                     NOTE:
                        If a secret token was provided, it will be redacted in
                        the response.

                     o For information about the authentication scheme  imple-
                       mented  by  GITHUB_HMAC,  see Securing your webhooks on
                       the GitHub Developer website.

                     o IP rejects webhooks trigger requests unless they origi-
                       nate  from an IP address in the IP range whitelisted in
                       the authentication configuration.

                     o UNAUTHENTICATED accepts all  webhook  trigger  requests
                       regardless of origin.

                 authenticationConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Properties  that  configure the authentication applied to
                     incoming webhook trigger requests. The  required  proper-
                     ties  depend on the authentication type. For GITHUB_HMAC,
                     only the SecretToken property must be set. For  IP,  only
                     the  AllowedIPRange  property must be set to a valid CIDR
                     range. For UNAUTHENTICATED, no properties can be set.

                     AllowedIPRange -> (string)
                        The property used to configure acceptance of  webhooks
                        in   an  IP  address  range.  For  IP,  only  the  Al-
                        lowedIPRange property must be set. This property  must
                        be set to a valid CIDR range.

                     SecretToken -> (string)
                        The  property used to configure GitHub authentication.
                        For GITHUB_HMAC, only the SecretToken property must be
                        set.

                        WARNING:
                            When  creating  CodePipeline  webhooks, do not use
                            your own credentials or reuse the same secret  to-
                            ken  across  multiple  webhooks. For optimal secu-
                            rity, generate a unique secret token for each web-
                            hook  you create. The secret token is an arbitrary
                            string that you provide, which GitHub uses to com-
                            pute  and  sign the webhook payloads sent to Code-
                            Pipeline, for protecting the integrity and authen-
                            ticity  of  the  webhook  payloads. Using your own
                            credentials or reusing the same token across  mul-
                            tiple  webhooks  can lead to security vulnerabili-
                            ties.

                        NOTE:
                            If  a  secret  token  was  provided,  it  will  be
                            redacted in the response.

              url -> (string)
                 A  unique  URL generated by CodePipeline. When a POST request
                 is made to this URL, the defined pipeline is started as  long
                 as the body of the post request satisfies the defined authen-
                 tication and filtering conditions. Deleting and re-creating a
                 webhook makes the old URL invalid and generates a new one.

              errorMessage -> (string)
                 The text of the error message about the webhook.

              errorCode -> (string)
                 The number code of the error.

              lastTriggered -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time a webhook was last successfully triggered,
                 in timestamp format.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the webhook.

              tags -> (list)
                 Specifies the tags applied to the webhook.

                 (structure)
                     A tag is a key-value pair that is used to manage the  re-
                     source.

                     key -> (string)
                        The tag's key.

                     value -> (string)
                        The tag's value.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  amount  of  returned information is significantly large, an
          identifier is also returned and can be used in a subsequent ListWeb-
          hooks call to return the next set of webhooks in the list.
