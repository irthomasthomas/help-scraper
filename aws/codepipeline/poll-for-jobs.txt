POLL-FOR-JOBS()                                                POLL-FOR-JOBS()



NAME
       poll-for-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  any  jobs  for AWS CodePipeline to act on.
       PollForJobs is valid only for action types with "Custom" in  the  owner
       field.  If  the action type contains "AWS" or "ThirdParty" in the owner
       field, the PollForJobs action returns an error.

       WARNING:
          When this API is called, AWS CodePipeline returns temporary  creden-
          tials for the S3 bucket used to store artifacts for the pipeline, if
          the action requires access to that S3 bucket for input or output ar-
          tifacts. This API also returns any secret values defined for the ac-
          tion.

OPTIONS
       --action-type-id (structure)
          Represents information about an action type.

          category -> (string)
              A category defines what kind of  action  can  be  taken  in  the
              stage,  and  constrains  the provider type for the action. Valid
              categories are limited to one of the following values.

              o Source

              o Build

              o Test

              o Deploy

              o Invoke

              o Approval

          owner -> (string)
              The creator of the action being called. There  are  three  valid
              values for the Owner field in the action category section within
              your pipeline structure: AWS , ThirdParty ,  and  Custom  .  For
              more  information, see Valid Action Types and Providers in Code-
              Pipeline .

          provider -> (string)
              The provider of the service being called by  the  action.  Valid
              providers are determined by the action category. For example, an
              action in the Deploy category type might have a provider of  AWS
              CodeDeploy, which would be specified as CodeDeploy. For more in-
              formation, see Valid Action Types and Providers in  CodePipeline
              .

          version -> (string)
              A string that describes the action version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          category=string,owner=string,provider=string,version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "category": "Source"|"Build"|"Deploy"|"Test"|"Invoke"|"Approval",
            "owner": "AWS"|"ThirdParty"|"Custom",
            "provider": "string",
            "version": "string"
          }

       --max-batch-size (integer)
          The maximum number of jobs to return in a poll for jobs call.

       --query-param (map)
          A  map  of  property  names  and  values. For an action type with no
          queryable properties, this value must be null or an empty  map.  For
          an action type with a queryable property, you must supply that prop-
          erty as a key in the  map.  Only  jobs  whose  action  configuration
          matches the mapped value are returned.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view any available jobs

       This example returns information about any jobs for a job worker to act
       upon. This example uses a pre-defined JSON file (MyActionTypeInfo.json)
       to  supply  information  about the action type for which the job worker
       processes jobs. This command is only used for custom actions. When this
       command  is  called, AWS CodePipeline returns temporary credentials for
       the Amazon S3 bucket used to store artifacts  for  the  pipeline.  This
       command  will  also return any secret values defined for the action, if
       any are defined.

       Command:

          aws codepipeline poll-for-jobs --cli-input-json file://MyActionTypeInfo.json

       JSON file sample contents:

          {
            "actionTypeId": {
              "category": "Test",
              "owner": "Custom",

                     Represents information about an action type.

                     category -> (string)
                        A category defines what kind of action can be taken in
                        the  stage,  and  constrains the provider type for the
                        action. Valid categories are limited  to  one  of  the
                        following values.

                 artifactCredentials -> (structure)
                     Represents an AWS session credentials object. These  cre-
                     dentials are temporary credentials that are issued by AWS
                     Secure Token Service (STS). They can be  used  to  access
                     input and output artifacts in the S3 bucket used to store
                     artifacts for the pipeline in AWS CodePipeline.

                 continuationToken -> (string)
                     A system-generated token, such as a  AWS  CodeDeploy  de-
                     ployment  ID, required by a job to continue the job asyn-
                     chronously.

                 encryptionKey -> (structure)
                     Represents information about the key used to encrypt data
                     in the artifact store, such as an AWS Key Management Ser-
                     vice (AWS KMS) key.

                     id -> (string)
                        The ID used to identify the key. For an AWS  KMS  key,
                        you can use the key ID, the key ARN, or the alias ARN.

                        NOTE:
                            Aliases  are  recognized  only in the account that
                            created  the  customer  master  key   (CMK).   For
                            cross-account actions, you can only use the key ID
                            or key ARN to identify the key.

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of encryption key, such as an AWS Key Manage-
                        ment  Service (AWS KMS) key. When creating or updating
                        a pipeline, the value must be set to 'KMS'.

              nonce -> (string)
                 A system-generated random number that AWS  CodePipeline  uses
                 to  ensure  that  the  job is being worked on by only one job
                 worker. Use this number in an  AcknowledgeJob request.

              accountId -> (string)
                 The ID of the AWS account to use when performing the job.
