LIST-ACTION-TYPES()                                        LIST-ACTION-TYPES()



NAME
       list-action-types -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  summary  of all CodePipeline action types associated with your
       account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-action-types is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: actionTypes

OPTIONS
       --action-owner-filter (string)
          Filters the list of action types to those created by a specified en-
          tity.

          Possible values:

          o AWS

          o ThirdParty

          o Custom

       --region-filter (string)
          The Region to filter on for the list of action types.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view the action types available

       Used  by itself, the list-action-types command returns the structure of
       all actions available to your AWS account. This example uses the  --ac-
       tion-owner-filter option to return only custom actions.

       Command:

          aws codepipeline list-action-types --action-owner-filter Custom

       Output:

OUTPUT
       actionTypes -> (list)
          Provides details of the action types.

          (structure)
              Returns information about the details of an action type.

              id -> (structure)
                 Represents information about an action type.

                 category -> (string)
                     A  category  defines  what kind of action can be taken in
                     the stage, and constrains the provider type for  the  ac-
                     tion.  Valid categories are limited to one of the follow-
                     ing values.

                     o Source

                     o Build

                     o Test

                     o Deploy

                     o Invoke

                     o Approval

                 owner -> (string)
                     The creator of the action being called. There  are  three
                     valid  values  for the Owner field in the action category
                     section within your pipeline structure: AWS ,  ThirdParty
                     ,  and  Custom  .  For more information, see Valid Action
                     Types and Providers in CodePipeline .

                 provider -> (string)
                     The provider of the service being called by  the  action.
                     Valid  providers  are  determined by the action category.
                     For example, an action in the Deploy category type  might
                     have  a  provider of CodeDeploy, which would be specified
                     as CodeDeploy . For more information,  see  Valid  Action
                     Types and Providers in CodePipeline .

                 version -> (string)
                     A string that describes the action version.

              settings -> (structure)
                 The settings for the action type.

                 thirdPartyConfigurationUrl -> (string)
                     The  URL of a sign-up page where users can sign up for an
                     external service and perform initial configuration of the
                     action provided by that service.

                 entityUrlTemplate -> (string)
                     The  URL  returned  to the CodePipeline console that pro-
                     vides a deep link to the resources of the  external  sys-
                     tem,  such as the configuration page for a CodeDeploy de-
                     ployment group. This link is provided as part of the  ac-
                     tion display in the pipeline.

                 executionUrlTemplate -> (string)
                     The  URL  returned  to the CodePipeline console that con-
                     tains a link to the top-level landing page for the exter-
                     nal system, such as the console page for CodeDeploy. This
                     link is shown on the pipeline  view  page  in  the  Code-
                     Pipeline console and provides a link to the execution en-
                     tity of the external action.

                 revisionUrlTemplate -> (string)
                     The URL returned to the CodePipeline  console  that  con-
                     tains  a  link  to the page where customers can update or
                     change the configuration of the external action.

              actionConfigurationProperties -> (list)
                 The configuration properties for the action type.

                 (structure)
                     Represents  information  about  an  action  configuration
                     property.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the action configuration property.

                     required -> (boolean)
                        Whether  the  configuration  property  is  a  required
                        value.

                     key -> (boolean)
                        Whether the configuration property is a key.

                     secret -> (boolean)
                        Whether the configuration property is secret.  Secrets
                        are  hidden  from all calls except for GetJobDetails ,
                        GetThirdPartyJobDetails , PollForJobs ,  and  PollFor-
                        ThirdPartyJobs .

                        When  updating  a  pipeline, passing * * * * * without
                        changing any other values of the action preserves  the
                        previous value of the secret.

                     queryable -> (boolean)
                        Indicates that the property is used with PollForJobs .
                        When creating a custom action, an action can  have  up
                        to  one  queryable property. If it has one, that prop-
                        erty must be both required and not secret.

                        If you create a pipeline with a  custom  action  type,
                        and  that custom action contains a queryable property,
                        the value for that configuration property  is  subject
                        to  other restrictions. The value must be less than or
                        equal to twenty (20) characters. The value can contain
                        only  alphanumeric  characters,  underscores,  and hy-
                        phens.

                     description -> (string)
                        The description of the action  configuration  property
                        that is displayed to users.

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of the configuration property.

              inputArtifactDetails -> (structure)
                 The details of the input artifact for the action, such as its
                 commit ID.

                 minimumCount -> (integer)
                     The minimum number of artifacts allowed  for  the  action
                     type.

                 maximumCount -> (integer)
                     The  maximum  number  of artifacts allowed for the action
                     type.

              outputArtifactDetails -> (structure)
                 The details of the output artifact of the action, such as its
                 commit ID.

                 minimumCount -> (integer)
                     The  minimum  number  of artifacts allowed for the action
                     type.

                 maximumCount -> (integer)
                     The maximum number of artifacts allowed  for  the  action
                     type.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  the  amount  of  returned information is significantly large, an
          identifier is also returned. It can be used in a subsequent list ac-
          tion types call to return the next set of action types in the list.
