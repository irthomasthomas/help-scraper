OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the pipeline to start.

       --variables (list)
          A list that overrides pipeline variables for  a  pipeline  execution
          that's  being  started. Variable names must match [A-Za-z0-9@\-_]+ ,
          and the values can be anything except an empty string.

          (structure)
              A pipeline-level variable used for a pipeline execution.

              NOTE:
                 V2 type pipelines, along with triggers on Git tags and  pipe-
                 line-level  variables, are not currently supported for Cloud-
                 Formation and CDK resources in CodePipeline. For more  infor-
                 mation  about  V2  type  pipelines, see Pipeline types in the
                 CodePipeline User Guide .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of a pipeline-level variable.

              value -> (string)
                 The value of a pipeline-level variable.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-request-token (string)
          The system-generated unique ID used to identify a  unique  execution
          request.

       --source-revisions (list)
          A  list that allows you to specify, or override, the source revision
          for a pipeline execution that's being started. A source revision  is
          the version with all the changes to your application code, or source
          artifact, for the pipeline execution.

          (structure)
              A list that allows you to specify, or override, the source revi-
              sion for a pipeline execution that's being started. A source re-
              vision is the version with all the changes to  your  application
              code, or source artifact, for the pipeline execution.

              actionName -> (string)
                 The name of the action where the override will be applied.

              revisionType -> (string)
                 The  type  of  source revision, based on the source provider.
                 For example, the revision  type  for  the  CodeCommit  action
                 provider is the commit ID.

              revisionValue -> (string)
                 The source revision, or version of your source artifact, with
                 the changes that you want to run in the pipeline execution.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          actionName=string,revisionType=string,revisionValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "actionName": "string",
              "revisionType": "COMMIT_ID"|"IMAGE_DIGEST"|"S3_OBJECT_VERSION_ID",
              "revisionValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To run the latest revision through a pipeline

       This example runs the latest revision present in the source stage of  a
       pipeline through the pipeline named "MyFirstPipeline".

       Command:

          aws codepipeline start-pipeline-execution --name MyFirstPipeline

       Output:

          {
            "pipelineExecutionId": "3137f7cb-7cf7-EXAMPLE"
          }

OUTPUT
       pipelineExecutionId -> (string)
          The  unique  system-generated  ID of the pipeline execution that was
          started.
