OPTIONS
       --rule-owner-filter (string)
          The rule owner to filter on.

          Possible values:

          o AWS

       --region-filter (string)
          The rule Region to filter on.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ruleTypes -> (list)
          Lists the rules that are configured for the condition.

          (structure)
              The rule type, which is made up of the combined values for cate-
              gory, owner, provider, and version.

              id -> (structure)
                 Represents information about a rule type.

                 category -> (string)
                     A  category  defines  what kind of rule can be run in the
                     stage, and constrains the provider  type  for  the  rule.
                     Valid categories are limited to one of the following val-
                     ues.

                     o INVOKE

                     o Approval

                     o Rule

                 owner -> (string)
                     The creator of the rule being called. The valid value for
                     the Owner field in the rule category is AWS .

                 provider -> (string)
                     The  provider  of  the  service being called by the rule.
                     Valid providers are determined by the  rulecategory.  For
                     example,  a managed rule in the Rule category type has an
                     owner of AWS, which would be specified as AWS .

                 version -> (string)
                     A string that describes the rule version.

              settings -> (structure)
                 Returns information about the settings for a rule type.

                 thirdPartyConfigurationUrl -> (string)
                     The URL of a sign-up page where users can sign up for  an
                     external service and perform initial configuration of the
                     action provided by that service.

                 entityUrlTemplate -> (string)
                     The URL returned to the CodePipeline  console  that  pro-
                     vides  a  deep link to the resources of the external sys-
                     tem, such as the configuration page for a CodeDeploy  de-
                     ployment  group. This link is provided as part of the ac-
                     tion display in the pipeline.

                 executionUrlTemplate -> (string)
                     The URL returned to the CodePipeline  console  that  con-
                     tains a link to the top-level landing page for the exter-
                     nal system, such as the console page for CodeDeploy. This
                     link  is  shown  on  the  pipeline view page in the Code-
                     Pipeline console and provides a link to the execution en-
                     tity of the external action.

                 revisionUrlTemplate -> (string)
                     The  URL  returned  to the CodePipeline console that con-
                     tains a link to the page where customers  can  update  or
                     change the configuration of the external action.

              ruleConfigurationProperties -> (list)
                 The configuration properties for the rule type.

                 (structure)
                     Represents  information  about a rule configuration prop-
                     erty.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the rule configuration property.

                     key -> (boolean)
                        Whether the configuration property is a key.

                     secret -> (boolean)
                        Whether the configuration property is secret.

                        When  updating  a  pipeline, passing * * * * * without
                        changing any other values of the action preserves  the
                        previous value of the secret.

                     queryable -> (boolean)
                        Indicates whether the property can be queried.

                        If  you  create  a pipeline with a condition and rule,
                        and that rule contains a queryable property, the value
                        for  that  configuration  property is subject to other
                        restrictions. The value must be less than or equal  to
                        twenty (20) characters. The value can contain only al-
                        phanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens.

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of the configuration property.

                     The  minimum  number  of artifacts allowed for the action
                     type.

                 maximumCount -> (integer)
                     The maximum number of artifacts allowed  for  the  action
                     type.
