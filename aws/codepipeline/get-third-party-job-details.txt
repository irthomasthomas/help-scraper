NAME
       get-third-party-job-details -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests  the details of a job for a third party action. Used for part-
       ner actions only.

       WARNING:
          When this API is called, CodePipeline returns temporary  credentials
          for  the  S3 bucket used to store artifacts for the pipeline, if the
          action requires access to that S3 bucket for input or  output  arti-
          facts.  This  API also returns any secret values defined for the ac-
          tion.

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The unique system-generated ID used for identifying the job.

       --client-token (string)
          The clientToken portion of the clientId and clientToken pair used to
          verify  that the calling entity is allowed access to the job and its
          details.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

                 The input artifact name must match the name of an output  ar-
                 tifact  generated  by an action in an earlier action or stage
                 of the pipeline.

                 (structure)
                     Artifacts are the files that are worked on by actions  in
                     the  pipeline.  See the action configuration for each ac-
                     tion for details about artifact parameters. For  example,
                     the  S3  source  action  artifact is a file name (or file
                     path), and the files are  generally  provided  as  a  ZIP
                     file. Example artifact name: SampleApp_Windows.zip

                     revision -> (string)
                        The  artifact's  revision ID. Depending on the type of
                        object, this could be a commit ID (GitHub) or a  revi-
                        sion ID (Amazon S3).

                     location -> (structure)
                        The location of an artifact.

                        type -> (string)
                            The type of artifact in the location.

                        s3Location -> (structure)
                            The S3 bucket that contains the artifact.

                            bucketName -> (string)
                               The name of the S3 bucket.

              outputArtifacts -> (list)
                 The name of the artifact that is the result of the action, if
                 any.  This  name  might be system-generated, such as "MyBuil-
                 tApp", or it might be defined by the user when the action  is
                 created.

                 (structure)
                     Artifacts  are the files that are worked on by actions in
                     the pipeline. See the action configuration for  each  ac-
                     tion  for details about artifact parameters. For example,
                     the S3 source action artifact is a  file  name  (or  file
                     path),  and  the  files  are  generally provided as a ZIP
                     file. Example artifact name: SampleApp_Windows.zip

                     name -> (string)

                        The location of an artifact.

                        type -> (string)
                            The type of artifact in the location.

                        s3Location -> (structure)
                            The S3 bucket that contains the artifact.

                            bucketName -> (string)
                               The name of the S3 bucket.

                            objectKey -> (string)
                               The key of the object in the S3  bucket,  which
                               uniquely identifies the object in the bucket.

              artifactCredentials -> (structure)
                 Represents an Amazon Web Services session credentials object.
                 These credentials are temporary credentials that  are  issued
                 by  Amazon  Web Services Secure Token Service (STS). They can
                 be used to access input and output artifacts in the S3 bucket
                 used to store artifact for the pipeline in CodePipeline.

                 accessKeyId -> (string)
                     The access key for the session.

                 secretAccessKey -> (string)
                     The secret access key for the session.

                 sessionToken -> (string)
                     The token for the session.

              continuationToken -> (string)
                 A system-generated token, such as a CodeDeploy deployment ID,
                 that a job requires to continue the job asynchronously.

              encryptionKey -> (structure)
                 The encryption key used to encrypt and decrypt  data  in  the
                 artifact  store  for the pipeline, such as an Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services  KMS)  key.
                 This is optional and might not be present.

                 id -> (string)
                     The  ID  used to identify the key. For an Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices KMS key, you can use the key ID, the  key  ARN,  or
                     the alias ARN.

                     NOTE:
                        Aliases  are  recognized only in the account that cre-
                        ated the KMS key. For cross-account actions,  you  can
                        only  use  the  key ID or key ARN to identify the key.
                        Cross-account actions involve using the role from  the
                        other  account  (AccountB),  so  specifying the key ID
                        will use the key from the other account (AccountB).

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of encryption key, such as an  Amazon  Web  Ser-
                     vices  KMS key. When creating or updating a pipeline, the
                     value must be set to 'KMS'.

          nonce -> (string)
              A system-generated random number that CodePipeline uses  to  en-
              sure that the job is being worked on by only one job worker. Use
              this number in an  AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob request.
