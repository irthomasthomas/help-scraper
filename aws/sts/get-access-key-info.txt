GET-ACCESS-KEY-INFO()                                    GET-ACCESS-KEY-INFO()



NAME
       get-access-key-info -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the account identifier for the specified access key ID.

       Access  keys  consist of two parts: an access key ID (for example, AKI-
       AIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE ) and a secret access key  (for  example,  wJalrXUtn-
       FEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY  ).  For  more information about access
       keys, see Managing Access Keys for IAM Users in the IAM User Guide .

       When you pass an access key ID to this operation, it returns the ID  of
       the  Amazon  Web  Services account to which the keys belong. Access key
       IDs beginning with AKIA are long-term credentials for an  IAM  user  or
       the  Amazon  Web  Services  account root user. Access key IDs beginning
       with ASIA are temporary credentials that are created using  STS  opera-
       tions.  If  the account in the response belongs to you, you can sign in
       as the root user and review your root user access keys. Then,  you  can
       pull  a  credentials  report  to learn which IAM user owns the keys. To
       learn who requested the temporary credentials for an ASIA  access  key,
       view the STS events in your CloudTrail logs in the IAM User Guide .

       This  operation  does not indicate the state of the access key. The key
       might be active, inactive, or deleted. Active keys might not have  per-
       missions  to perform an operation. Providing a deleted access key might
       return an error that the key doesn't exist.

OPTIONS
       --access-key-id (string)
          The identifier of an access key.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern) a string of  char-
          acters that can consist of any upper- or lowercase letter or digit.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
