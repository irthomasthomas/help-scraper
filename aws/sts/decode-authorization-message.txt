DECODE-AUTHORIZATION-MESSAGE()                  DECODE-AUTHORIZATION-MESSAGE()



NAME
       decode-authorization-message -

DESCRIPTION
       Decodes  additional information about the authorization status of a re-
       quest from an encoded message returned in response  to  an  Amazon  Web
       Services request.

       For  example,  if a user is not authorized to perform an operation that
       he or she has requested, the request returns a Client.UnauthorizedOper-
       ation  response (an HTTP 403 response). Some Amazon Web Services opera-
       tions additionally return an encoded message that can  provide  details
       about this authorization failure.

       NOTE:
          Only certain Amazon Web Services operations return an encoded autho-
          rization message. The documentation for an individual operation  in-
          dicates  whether  that operation returns an encoded message in addi-
          tion to returning an HTTP code.

       The message is encoded because the details of the authorization  status
       can  contain privileged information that the user who requested the op-
       eration should not see. To decode an authorization  status  message,  a
       user  must  be granted permissions through an IAM policy to request the
       DecodeAuthorizationMessage (sts:DecodeAuthorizationMessage ) action.

       The decoded message includes the following type of information:

       o Whether the request was denied due to an explicit deny or due to  the
         absence  of  an explicit allow. For more information, see Determining
         Whether a Request is Allowed or Denied in the IAM User Guide .

       o The principal who made the request.

       o The requested action.

       o The requested resource.

       o The values of condition keys in the context of the user's request.

OPTIONS
       --encoded-message (string)
          The encoded message that was returned with the response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       DecodedMessage -> (string)
          The API returns a response with the decoded message.
