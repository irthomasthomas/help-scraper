ASSUME-ROOT()                                                    ASSUME-ROOT()



NAME
       assume-root -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  set of short term credentials you can use to perform privi-
       leged tasks in a member account.

       Before you can launch a privileged session, you must have enabled  cen-
       tralized  root  access  in  your organization. For steps to enable this
       feature, see Centralize root access for member accounts in the IAM User
       Guide .

       NOTE:
          The  global  endpoint is not supported for AssumeRoot. You must send
          this request to a Regional STS endpoint. For more  information,  see
          Endpoints .

       You  can  track AssumeRoot in CloudTrail logs to determine what actions
       were performed in a session. For more information, see Track privileged
       tasks in CloudTrail in the IAM User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --target-principal (string)
          The member account principal ARN or account ID.

       --task-policy-arn (structure)
          The  identity based policy that scopes the session to the privileged
          tasks that can be performed. You can use one of following Amazon Web
          Services managed policies to scope root session actions. You can add
          additional customer managed policies to further  limit  the  permis-
          sions for the root session.

          o IAMAuditRootUserCredentials

          o IAMCreateRootUserPassword

          o IAMDeleteRootUserCredentials

          o S3UnlockBucketPolicy

          o SQSUnlockQueuePolicy

          arn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM managed policy to use
              as a session policy for the role.  For  more  information  about
              ARNs,  see  Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services
              Service Namespaces in the Amazon Web Services General  Reference
              .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          arn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "arn": "string"
          }

       --duration-seconds (integer)
          The  duration,  in seconds, of the privileged session. The value can
          range from 0 seconds up to the maximum session duration of 900  sec-
          onds  (15 minutes). If you specify a value higher than this setting,
          the operation fails.

          By default, the value is set to 900 seconds.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Credentials -> (structure)
          The temporary security credentials, which include an access key  ID,
          a secret access key, and a security token.

          NOTE:
              The size of the security token that STS API operations return is
              not fixed. We strongly recommend that you  make  no  assumptions
              about the maximum size.

          AccessKeyId -> (string)
              The access key ID that identifies the temporary security creden-
              tials.

          SecretAccessKey -> (string)
              The secret access key that can be used to sign requests.

          SessionToken -> (string)
              The token that users must pass to the service  API  to  use  the
              temporary credentials.

          Expiration -> (timestamp)
              The date on which the current credentials expire.

       SourceIdentity -> (string)
          The  source  identity specified by the principal that is calling the
          AssumeRoot operation.

          You can use the aws:SourceIdentity condition key to  control  access
          based  on  the  value of source identity. For more information about
          using source identity, see Monitor and control  actions  taken  with
          assumed roles in the IAM User Guide .

          The  regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
          consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with  no
          spaces.  You  can  also  include underscores or any of the following
          characters: =,.@-
