GET-CALLER-IDENTITY()                                    GET-CALLER-IDENTITY()



NAME
       get-caller-identity -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  details  about the IAM user or role whose credentials are used
       to call the operation.

       NOTE:
          No permissions are required to perform this operation. If an  admin-
          istrator  attaches  a policy to your identity that explicitly denies
          access to the sts:GetCallerIdentity action, you  can  still  perform
          this operation. Permissions are not required because the same infor-
          mation is returned when access is denied. To  view  an  example  re-
          sponse,  see I Am Not Authorized to Perform: iam:DeleteVirtualMFADe-
          vice in the IAM User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get details about the current IAM identity

       The following get-caller-identity command  displays  information  about
       the IAM identity used to authenticate the request. The caller is an IAM
       user.

          aws sts get-caller-identity

       Output:

          {
              "UserId": "AIDASAMPLEUSERID",
              "Account": "123456789012",
              "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/DevAdmin"
          }

OUTPUT
       UserId -> (string)
          The unique identifier of the calling entity. The exact value depends
          on  the  type of entity that is making the call. The values returned
          are those listed in the aws:userid column  in  the  Principal  table
          found on the Policy Variables reference page in the IAM User Guide .

       Account -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Web Services account ID number of the account that owns
          or contains the calling entity.

       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Web Services ARN associated with the calling entity.
