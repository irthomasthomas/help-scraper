          --email-address <value>
          --type <value>
          [--first-name <value>]

OPTIONS
       --email-address (string)
          The  email  address of the user that you want to register. The email
          address serves as a uniquer identifier for each user and  cannot  be
          changed after it's created.

       --type (string)
          The  option  to  indicate the type of user. Use one of the following
          options to specify this parameter:

          o SUPER_USER  A user with permission to all  the  functionality  and
            data in FinSpace.

          o APP_USER   A user with specific permissions in FinSpace. The users
            are assigned permissions by adding them to a permission group.

          Possible values:

          o SUPER_USER

          o APP_USER

       --first-name (string)
          The first name of the user that you want to register.

       --last-name (string)
          The last name of the user that you want to register.

       --api-access (string)
          The option to indicate whether the user can use the  GetProgrammati-
          cAccessCredentials  API  to obtain credentials that can then be used
          to access other FinSpace Data API operations.

          o ENABLED  The user has permissions to use the APIs.

          o DISABLED  The user does not have permissions to use any APIs.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DISABLED

       --api-access-principal-arn (string)
          The ARN identifier of an AWS user or role that is  allowed  to  call
          the GetProgrammaticAccessCredentials API to obtain a credentials to-
          ken for a specific FinSpace user. This must be an  IAM  role  within
          your FinSpace account.

       --client-token (string)
          A token that ensures idempotency. This token expires in 10 minutes.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       userId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the user.
