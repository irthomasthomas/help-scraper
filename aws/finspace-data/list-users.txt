LIST-USERS()                                                      LIST-USERS()



NAME
       list-users -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all available user accounts in FinSpace.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-users  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: users

SYNOPSIS
            list-users
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       users -> (list)
          A list of all the user accounts.

          (structure)

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the user account.

                 o CREATING  The user account creation is in progress.

                 o ENABLED  The user account is created and is  currently  ac-
                   tive.

                 o DISABLED  The user account is currently inactive.

              firstName -> (string)

              lastName -> (string)
                 The last name of the user.

              emailAddress -> (string)
                 The  email address of the user. The email address serves as a
                 uniquer identifier for each user and cannot be changed  after
                 it's created.

              type -> (string)
                 Indicates the type of user.

                 o SUPER_USER  A user with permission to all the functionality
                   and data in FinSpace.

                 o APP_USER  A user with specific permissions in FinSpace. The
                   users  are assigned permissions by adding them to a permis-
                   sion group.

              apiAccess -> (string)
                 Indicates whether the user can use the GetProgrammaticAccess-
                 Credentials  API  to obtain credentials that can then be used
                 to access other FinSpace Data API operations.

                 o ENABLED  The user has permissions to use the APIs.

                 o DISABLED  The user does not have  permissions  to  use  any
                   APIs.

              apiAccessPrincipalArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN identifier of an AWS user or role that is allowed to
                 call the GetProgrammaticAccessCredentials  API  to  obtain  a
                 credentials  token for a specific FinSpace user. This must be
                 an IAM role within your FinSpace account.

              createTime -> (long)
                 The timestamp at  which  the  user  account  was  created  in

                 onds.

              lastEnabledTime -> (long)
                 Describes the last time the user  account  was  enabled.  The
                 value is determined as epoch time in milliseconds.

              lastDisabledTime -> (long)
                 Describes  the  last  time the user account was disabled. The
                 value is determined as epoch time in milliseconds.

              lastModifiedTime -> (long)
                 Describes the last time the user  account  was  updated.  The
                 value is determined as epoch time in milliseconds.

              lastLoginTime -> (long)
                 Describes  the  last time that the user logged into their ac-
                 count. The value is determined as epoch time in milliseconds.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where a results page should begin.
