OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the DAX cluster to be modified.

       --description (string)
          A description of the changes being made to the cluster.

       --preferred-maintenance-window (string)
          A  range  of  time  when maintenance of DAX cluster software will be
          performed. For example: sun:01:00-sun:09:00  .  Cluster  maintenance
          normally  takes less than 30 minutes, and is performed automatically
          within the maintenance window.

       --notification-topic-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the topic.

       --notification-topic-status (string)
          The current state of the topic. A value of active means that notifi-
          cations  will  be  sent to the topic. A value of inactive means that
          notifications will not be sent to the topic.

       --parameter-group-name (string)
          The name of a parameter group for this cluster.

       --security-group-ids (list)
          A list of user-specified security group IDs to be assigned  to  each
          node in the DAX cluster. If this parameter is not specified, DAX as-
          signs the default VPC security group to each node.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
