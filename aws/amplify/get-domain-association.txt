            get-domain-association
          --app-id <value>
          --domain-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-id (string)
          The unique id for an Amplify app.

       --domain-name (string)
          The name of the domain.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT

          domainStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the domain association.

          updateStatus -> (string)
              The  status  of the domain update operation that is currently in
              progress. The following list describes the valid update states.
                 REQUESTING_CERTIFICATE

              The certificate is in the process of being updated.
                 PENDING_VERIFICATION

              Indicates that an Amplify managed certificate is in the  process
              of  being  verified. This occurs during the creation of a custom
              domain or when a custom domain is updated to use a managed  cer-
              tificate.
                 IMPORTING_CUSTOM_CERTIFICATE

              Indicates  that  an Amplify custom certificate is in the process
              of being imported. This occurs during the creation of  a  custom
              domain  or  when a custom domain is updated to use a custom cer-
              tificate.
                 PENDING_DEPLOYMENT

              Indicates that the subdomain or certificate  changes  are  being
              propagated.
                 AWAITING_APP_CNAME

              Amplify is waiting for CNAME records corresponding to subdomains
              to be propagated. If your custom domain is on Route 53,  Amplify
              handles  this  for you automatically. For more information about
              custom domains, see Setting up custom  domains  in  the  Amplify
              Hosting User Guide .
                 UPDATE_COMPLETE

              The certificate has been associated with a domain.
                 UPDATE_FAILED

              The  certificate has failed to be provisioned or associated, and
              there is no existing active certificate to roll back to.

          statusReason -> (string)
              Additional information that describes why the domain association
              is in the current state.

          certificateVerificationDNSRecord -> (string)
              The DNS record for certificate verification.

          subDomains -> (list)
              The subdomains for the domain association.

              (structure)
                 The subdomain for the domain association.

                 subDomainSetting -> (structure)
                     Describes the settings for the subdomain.

                     prefix -> (string)
                        The prefix setting for the subdomain.

                     branchName -> (string)
                        The branch name setting for the subdomain.

                 verified -> (boolean)
                     The verified status of the subdomain

                 dnsRecord -> (string)
                     The DNS record for the subdomain.

          certificate -> (structure)
              Describes  the  SSL/TLS  certificate for the domain association.
              This can be your own custom certificate or the default  certifi-
              cate that Amplify provisions for you.

              If  you are updating your domain to use a different certificate,
              certificate points to the new certificate that is being  created
              instead  of  the current active certificate. Otherwise, certifi-
              cate points to the current active certificate.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of SSL/TLS certificate that you want to use.

                 Specify AMPLIFY_MANAGED to use the default  certificate  that
                 Amplify provisions for you.

                 Specify  CUSTOM to use your own certificate that you have al-
                 ready added to Certificate Manager in your  Amazon  Web  Ser-
                 vices account. Make sure you request (or import) the certifi-
                 cate in the US East (N.  Virginia)  Region  (us-east-1).  For
                 more  information about using ACM, see Importing certificates
                 into Certificate Manager in the ACM User guide .

              customCertificateArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon resource name (ARN) for a custom certificate  that
                 you  have already added to Certificate Manager in your Amazon
                 Web Services account.

                 This field is required only when the certificate type is CUS-
                 TOM .

              certificateVerificationDNSRecord -> (string)
