          read-only  deploy  key  using  SSH  cloning.  The OAuth token is not
          stored.

          Use oauthToken for repository providers other than GitHub,  such  as
          Bitbucket or CodeCommit.

          To  authorize  access to GitHub as your repository provider, use ac-
          cessToken .

          You must specify either oauthToken or accessToken when you update an
          app.

          Existing  Amplify apps deployed from a GitHub repository using OAuth
          continue to work with CI/CD. However, we strongly recommend that you
          migrate  these apps to use the GitHub App. For more information, see
          Migrating an existing OAuth app to the Amplify GitHub App in the Am-
          plify User Guide .

       --access-token (string)
          The  personal  access  token  for a GitHub repository for an Amplify
          app. The personal access token is used  to  authorize  access  to  a
          GitHub  repository  using  the  Amplify GitHub App. The token is not
          stored.

          Use accessToken for GitHub repositories only. To authorize access to
          a  repository provider such as Bitbucket or CodeCommit, use oauthTo-
          ken .

          You must specify either accessToken or oauthToken when you update an
          app.

          Existing  Amplify apps deployed from a GitHub repository using OAuth
          continue to work with CI/CD. However, we strongly recommend that you
          migrate  these apps to use the GitHub App. For more information, see
          Migrating an existing OAuth app to the Amplify GitHub App in the Am-
          plify User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
