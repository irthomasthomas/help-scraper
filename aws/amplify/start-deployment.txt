START-DEPLOYMENT()                                          START-DEPLOYMENT()



NAME
       start-deployment -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts a deployment for a manually deployed app. Manually deployed apps
       are not connected to a Git repository.

       The maximum duration between the CreateDeployment call and the StartDe-
       ployment  call  cannot exceed 8 hours. If the duration exceeds 8 hours,
       the StartDeployment call and the associated Job will fail.

OPTIONS
       --app-id (string)
          The unique ID for an Amplify app.

       --branch-name (string)
          The name of the branch to use for the deployment job.

       --job-id (string)
          The job ID for this deployment that is generated  by  the  CreateDe-
          ployment request.

       --source-url (string)
          The source URL for the deployment that is used when calling StartDe-
          ployment without CreateDeployment . The source URL can be either  an
          HTTP GET URL that is publicly accessible and downloads a single .zip
          file, or an Amazon S3 bucket and prefix.

       --source-url-type (string)
          The type of source specified by the sourceURL . If the value is  ZIP
          ,  the  source  is  a .zip file. If the value is BUCKET_PREFIX , the
          source is an Amazon S3 bucket and prefix. If no value is  specified,
          the default is ZIP .

          Possible values:

          o ZIP

          o BUCKET_PREFIX

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
