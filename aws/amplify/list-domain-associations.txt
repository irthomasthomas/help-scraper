LIST-DOMAIN-ASSOCIATIONS()                          LIST-DOMAIN-ASSOCIATIONS()



NAME
       list-domain-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the domain associations for an Amplify app.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-domain-associations  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: domainAssociations

SYNOPSIS
            list-domain-associations

          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-id (string)
          The unique ID for an Amplify app.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                     REQUESTING_CERTIFICATE

                 The certificate is in the process of being updated.
                     PENDING_VERIFICATION

                 Indicates that an  Amplify  managed  certificate  is  in  the
                 process of being verified. This occurs during the creation of
                 a custom domain or when a custom domain is updated to  use  a
                 managed certificate.
                     IMPORTING_CUSTOM_CERTIFICATE

                 Indicates  that  an  Amplify  custom  certificate  is  in the
                 process of being imported. This occurs during the creation of
                 a  custom  domain or when a custom domain is updated to use a
                 custom certificate.
                     PENDING_DEPLOYMENT

                 Indicates that the subdomain or certificate changes are being
                 propagated.
                     AWAITING_APP_CNAME

                 Amplify  is waiting for CNAME records corresponding to subdo-
                 mains to be propagated. If your custom domain is on Route 53,
                 Amplify handles this for you automatically. For more informa-
                 tion about custom domains, see Setting up custom  domains  in
                 the Amplify Hosting User Guide .
                     UPDATE_COMPLETE

                 The certificate has been associated with a domain.
                     UPDATE_FAILED

                 The  certificate  has failed to be provisioned or associated,
                 and there is no existing active certificate to roll back to.

              statusReason -> (string)
                 Additional information that describes why the domain associa-
                 tion is in the current state.

              certificateVerificationDNSRecord -> (string)
                 The DNS record for certificate verification.

                        Describes the settings for the subdomain.

                        prefix -> (string)
                            The prefix setting for the subdomain.

                        branchName -> (string)
                            The branch name setting for the subdomain.

                     verified -> (boolean)

              certificate -> (structure)
                 Describes the SSL/TLS certificate for the domain association.
                 This can be your own custom certificate or the  default  cer-
                 tificate that Amplify provisions for you.

                 If  you  are updating your domain to use a different certifi-
                 cate, certificate points to the new certificate that is being
                 created instead of the current active certificate. Otherwise,
                 certificate points to the current active certificate.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of SSL/TLS certificate that you want to use.

                     Specify AMPLIFY_MANAGED to use  the  default  certificate
                     that Amplify provisions for you.

                     Specify  CUSTOM to use your own certificate that you have
                     already added to Certificate Manager in your  Amazon  Web
                     Services  account.  Make sure you request (or import) the
                     certificate  in  the  US  East   (N.   Virginia)   Region
                     (us-east-1).  For  more  information about using ACM, see
                     Importing certificates into Certificate  Manager  in  the
                     ACM User guide .

                 customCertificateArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  resource name (ARN) for a custom certificate
                     that you have already added  to  Certificate  Manager  in
                     your Amazon Web Services account.

                     This  field is required only when the certificate type is
                     CUSTOM .

                 certificateVerificationDNSRecord -> (string)
                     The DNS record for certificate verification.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A pagination token. If non-null, a pagination token is returned in a
          result. Pass its value in another request to retrieve more entries.
