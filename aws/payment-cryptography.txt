NAME
       payment-cryptography -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Web Services Payment Cryptography Control Plane APIs manage en-
       cryption keys for use during payment-related cryptographic  operations.
       You can create, import, export, share, manage, and delete keys. You can
       also manage Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for keys. For
       more  information, see Identity and access management in the Amazon Web
       Services Payment Cryptography User Guide.

       To use encryption keys for payment-related transaction  processing  and
       associated  cryptographic  operations,  you use the Amazon Web Services
       Payment Cryptography Data Plane . You can perform actions like encrypt,
       decrypt, generate, and verify payment-related data.

       All  Amazon  Web Services Payment Cryptography API calls must be signed
       and transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). We recommend  you
       always use the latest supported TLS version for logging API requests.

       Amazon  Web  Services Payment Cryptography supports CloudTrail for con-
       trol plane operations, a service that  logs  Amazon  Web  Services  API
       calls  and  related events for your Amazon Web Services account and de-
       livers them to an Amazon S3 bucket you specify. By using  the  informa-
       tion collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made
       to Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, who made the request, when
       it  was  made,  and  so on. If you don't congure a trail, you can still
       view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console. For more  infor-
       mation, see the CloudTrail User Guide .
