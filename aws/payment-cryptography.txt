PAYMENT-CRYPTOGRAPHY()                                  PAYMENT-CRYPTOGRAPHY()



NAME
       payment-cryptography -

DESCRIPTION
       You  use  the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography Control Plane to
       manage the encryption keys you use  for  payment-related  cryptographic
       operations.  You  can create, import, export, share, manage, and delete
       keys. You can also manage Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies
       for  keys.  For more information, see Identity and access management in
       the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide.

       To use encryption keys for payment-related transaction  processing  and
       associated  cryptographic  operations,  you use the Amazon Web Services
       Payment Cryptography Data Plane . You can encrypt,  decrypt,  generate,
       verify, and translate payment-related cryptographic operations.

       All  Amazon  Web Services Payment Cryptography API calls must be signed
       and transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). We recommend  you
       always use the latest supported TLS version for logging API requests.

       Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports CloudTrail, a service
       that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and  related  events  for  your
       Amazon  Web  Services  account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket
       that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you
       can  determine  what  requests were made to Amazon Web Services Payment
       Cryptography, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. If you
       don't congure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the
       CloudTrail console. For more information, see the CloudTrail User Guide
       .
