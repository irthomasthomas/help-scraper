DESCRIBE-STREAM-CONSUMER()                          DESCRIBE-STREAM-CONSUMER()



NAME
       describe-stream-consumer -

DESCRIPTION
       To get the description of a registered consumer, provide the ARN of the
       consumer. Alternatively, you can provide the ARN of the data stream and
       the  name  you  gave  the consumer when you registered it. You may also
       provide all three parameters, as long as they don't conflict with  each
       other.  If you don't know the name or ARN of the consumer that you want
       to describe, you can use the  ListStreamConsumers operation  to  get  a
       list of the descriptions of all the consumers that are currently regis-
       tered with a given data stream.

       This operation has a limit of 20 transactions per second per stream.

       NOTE:
          When making a cross-account call with DescribeStreamConsumer ,  make
          sure to provide the ARN of the consumer.

OPTIONS
       --stream-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of the Kinesis data stream that the consumer is registered
          with. For more information, see Amazon  Resource  Names  (ARNs)  and
          Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces .

       --consumer-name (string)
          The name that you gave to the consumer.

       --consumer-arn (string)
          The  ARN  returned  by  Kinesis Data Streams when you registered the
          consumer.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe a data stream consumer

       The  following describe-stream-consumer example returns the description
       of the specified consumer, registered with the specified data stream.

          aws kinesis describe-stream-consumer \
              --stream-arn arn:aws:kinesis:us-west-2:012345678912:stream/samplestream \
              --consumer-name KinesisConsumerApplication

       Output:

          {
              "ConsumerDescription": {
                  "ConsumerName": "KinesisConsumerApplication",
                  "ConsumerARN": "arn:aws:kinesis:us-west-2:123456789012:stream/samplestream/consumer/KinesisConsumerApplication:1572383852",
                  "ConsumerStatus": "ACTIVE",
                  "ConsumerCreationTimestamp": 1572383852.0,
                  "StreamARN": "arn:aws:kinesis:us-west-2:123456789012:stream/samplestream"
              }
          }

       For more information, see Reading Data from Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
       in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       ConsumerDescription -> (structure)
          An object that represents the details of the consumer.

          ConsumerName -> (string)
              The name of the consumer is something you choose when you regis-
              ter the consumer.

          ConsumerARN -> (string)
              When you register a consumer, Kinesis Data Streams generates  an
              ARN  for  it.  You  need  this  ARN to be able to call  Subscri-
              beToShard .

              If you delete a consumer and then create a new one with the same
              name,  it  won't have the same ARN. That's because consumer ARNs
              contain the creation timestamp. This is  important  to  keep  in
              mind if you have IAM policies that reference consumer ARNs.

          ConsumerStatus -> (string)
              A  consumer  can't  read  data while in the CREATING or DELETING
              states.

          ConsumerCreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)

          StreamARN -> (string)
              The ARN of the stream with which you registered the consumer.
