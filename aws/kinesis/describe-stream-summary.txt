DESCRIBE-STREAM-SUMMARY()                            DESCRIBE-STREAM-SUMMARY()



NAME
       describe-stream-summary -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  a summarized description of the specified Kinesis data stream
       without the shard list.

       NOTE:
          When invoking this API, you must use either  the  StreamARN  or  the
          StreamName  parameter,  or  both. It is recommended that you use the
          StreamARN input parameter when you invoke this API.

       The information returned includes the stream name, Amazon Resource Name
       (ARN), status, record retention period, approximate creation time, mon-
       itoring, encryption details, and open shard count.
          DescribeStreamSummary has a limit of 20 transactions per second  per
          account.

          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The name of the stream to describe.

       --stream-arn (string)
          The ARN of the stream.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       scription (without the shard list) of the specified data stream.

OUTPUT
       StreamDescriptionSummary -> (structure)
          A  StreamDescriptionSummary containing information about the stream.

          StreamName -> (string)
              The name of the stream being described.

          StreamARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the stream being described.

          StreamStatus -> (string)
              The  current  status  of  the stream being described. The stream
              status is one of the following states:

              o CREATING - The stream is being created. Kinesis  Data  Streams
                immediately returns and sets StreamStatus to CREATING .

              o DELETING  -  The stream is being deleted. The specified stream
                is in the DELETING state until Kinesis Data Streams  completes
                the deletion.

              o ACTIVE - The stream exists and is ready for read and write op-
                erations or deletion. You should perform read and write opera-
                tions only on an ACTIVE stream.

              o UPDATING  -  Shards  in  the stream are being merged or split.
                Read and write operations continue to work while the stream is
                in the UPDATING state.

          StreamModeDetails -> (structure)
              Specifies  the  capacity mode to which you want to set your data
              stream. Currently, in Kinesis Data Streams, you can  choose  be-
              tween  an  on-demand  ycapacity  mode and a provisioned capacity
              mode for your data streams.

              StreamMode -> (string)
                 Specifies the capacity mode to which you  want  to  set  your
                 data  stream.  Currently,  in  Kinesis  Data Streams, you can
                 choose between an on-demand capacity mode and  a  provisioned
                 capacity mode for your data streams.

          RetentionPeriodHours -> (integer)
              The current retention period, in hours.

          StreamCreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The approximate time that the stream was created.

          EnhancedMonitoring -> (list)
              Represents  the  current  enhanced  monitoring  settings  of the
              stream.

              (structure)
                 Represents enhanced metrics types.

                 ShardLevelMetrics -> (list)
                     List of shard-level metrics.

                     The following are  the  valid  shard-level  metrics.  The
                     value "ALL " enhances every metric.

                     o IncomingBytes

                     o IncomingRecords

                     o OutgoingBytes

                     o OutgoingRecords

                     o WriteProvisionedThroughputExceeded

                     o ReadProvisionedThroughputExceeded

                     o IteratorAgeMilliseconds

                     o ALL

                     (string)

          EncryptionType -> (string)
              The encryption type used. This value is one of the following:

              o KMS

              o NONE

          KeyId -> (string)
              The GUID for the customer-managed Amazon Web Services KMS key to
              use for encryption. This value can be a globally unique  identi-
              fier,  a  fully specified ARN to either an alias or a key, or an
              alias name prefixed by "alias/".You can also use  a  master  key
              owned  by Kinesis Data Streams by specifying the alias aws/kine-
              sis .

              o Key                        ARN                        example:
                arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

              o Alias                       ARN                       example:

              o Master key owned by Kinesis Data Streams: alias/aws/kinesis

          OpenShardCount -> (integer)
              The number of open shards in the stream.
