DELETE-STREAM()                                                DELETE-STREAM()



NAME
       delete-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  Kinesis  data  stream and all its shards and data. You must
       shut down any applications that are operating on the stream before  you
       delete  the  stream. If an application attempts to operate on a deleted
       stream, it receives the exception ResourceNotFoundException .

       NOTE:
          When invoking this API, it is recommended you use the StreamARN  in-
          put parameter rather than the StreamName input parameter.

       If  the  stream  is  in  the  ACTIVE  state, you can delete it. After a
       DeleteStream request, the specified stream is in the DELETING state un-
       til Kinesis Data Streams completes the deletion.
          Note:  Kinesis  Data  Streams might continue to accept data read and
          write operations, such as  PutRecord ,  PutRecords , and  GetRecords
          ,  on  a  stream  in the DELETING state until the stream deletion is
          complete.

       When you delete a stream, any shards in that stream are  also  deleted,
       and any tags are dissociated from the stream.

       You  can use the  DescribeStreamSummary operation to check the state of
       the stream, which is returned in StreamStatus .
          DeleteStream has a limit of five transactions  per  second  per  ac-
          count.

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The name of the stream to delete.

       --enforce-consumer-deletion | --no-enforce-consumer-deletion (boolean)
          If  this  parameter is unset (null ) or if you set it to false , and
          the stream has registered consumers, the call to DeleteStream  fails
          with a ResourceInUseException .

       --stream-arn (string)
          The ARN of the stream.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete a data stream

          aws kinesis delete-stream \
              --stream-name samplestream

       This command produces no output.
