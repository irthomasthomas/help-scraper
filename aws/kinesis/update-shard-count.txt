UPDATE-SHARD-COUNT()                                      UPDATE-SHARD-COUNT()



NAME
       update-shard-count -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the shard count of the specified stream to the specified number
       of shards. This API is only supported for the  data  streams  with  the
       provisioned capacity mode.

       NOTE:
          When  invoking  this  API,  you must use either the StreamARN or the
          StreamName parameter, or both. It is recommended that  you  use  the
          StreamARN input parameter when you invoke this API.

       Updating  the  shard count is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving
       the request, Kinesis Data Streams returns immediately and sets the sta-
       tus  of  the stream to UPDATING . After the update is complete, Kinesis
       Data Streams sets the status of the stream back to ACTIVE  .  Depending
       on  the size of the stream, the scaling action could take a few minutes
       to complete. You can continue to read and write  data  to  your  stream
       while its status is UPDATING .

       To  update  the  shard  count,  Kinesis Data Streams performs splits or
       merges on individual shards. This can cause short-lived  shards  to  be
       created,  in  addition  to  the  final shards. These short-lived shards
       count towards your total shard limit for your account in the Region.

       When using this operation, we recommend that you specify a target shard
       count  that is a multiple of 25% (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%). You can specify
       any target value within your shard limit. However,  if  you  specify  a
       target  that  isn't  a  multiple  of 25%, the scaling action might take
       longer to complete.

       This operation has the following default limits. By default, you cannot
       do the following:

       o Scale more than ten times per rolling 24-hour period per stream

       o Scale up to more than double your current shard count for a stream

       o Scale down below half your current shard count for a stream

       o Scale up to more than 10000 shards in a stream

       o Scale  a stream with more than 10000 shards down unless the result is
         less than 10000 shards

       o Scale up to more than the shard limit for your account

       o Make over 10 TPS. TPS over 10 will trigger the LimitExceededException

       For the default limits for an Amazon Web Services account, see  Streams
       Limits  in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide . To request
       an increase in the call rate limit, the shard limit for  this  API,  or
       your overall shard limit, use the limits form .

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The name of the stream.

       --target-shard-count (integer)
          The  new number of shards. This value has the following default lim-
          its. By default, you cannot do the following:

          o Set this value to more than double your current shard count for  a
            stream.

          o Set this value below half your current shard count for a stream.

          o Set  this value to more than 10000 shards in a stream (the default
            limit for shard count per stream is 10000 per account per region),
            unless you request a limit increase.

          o Scale  a  stream  with  more than 10000 shards down unless you set
            this value to less than 10000 shards.

       --scaling-type (string)
          The scaling type. Uniform scaling creates shards of equal size.

          Possible values:

          o UNIFORM_SCALING

       --stream-arn (string)
          The ARN of the stream.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update the shard count in a data stream

       The following update-shard-count example updates the shard count of the
       specified  data  stream  to 6. This example uses uniform scaling, which
       creates shards of equal size.

          aws kinesis update-shard-count \
              --stream-name samplestream \
              --scaling-type UNIFORM_SCALING \
              --target-shard-count 6

       Output:

          {
              "StreamName": "samplestream",
              "CurrentShardCount": 3,
              "TargetShardCount": 6
          }

       For more information, see Resharding a Stream  in  the  Amazon  Kinesis
       Data Streams Developer Guide.
