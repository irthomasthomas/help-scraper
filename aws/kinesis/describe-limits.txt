DESCRIBE-LIMITS()                                            DESCRIBE-LIMITS()



NAME
       describe-limits -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the shard limits and usage for the account.

       If you update your account limits, the old limits might be returned for
       a few minutes.

       This operation has a limit of one transaction per second per account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-limits
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe shard limits

       The following describe-limits example displays the shard limits and us-
       age for the current AWS account.

          aws kinesis describe-limits

       Output:

          {
              "ShardLimit": 500,
              "OpenShardCount": 29
          }

       For  more  information,  see  Resharding a Stream in the Amazon Kinesis
       Data Streams Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       ShardLimit -> (integer)
          The maximum number of shards.

       OpenShardCount -> (integer)
          The number of open shards.

       OnDemandStreamCount -> (integer)
          Indicates the number of data streams  with  the  on-demand  capacity
          mode.

       OnDemandStreamCountLimit -> (integer)
          The maximum number of data streams with the on-demand capacity mode.
