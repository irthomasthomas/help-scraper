MERGE-SHARDS()                                                  MERGE-SHARDS()



NAME
       merge-shards -

DESCRIPTION
       Merges  two  adjacent shards in a Kinesis data stream and combines them
       into a single shard to reduce  the  stream's  capacity  to  ingest  and
       transport  data.  This  API is only supported for the data streams with
       the provisioned capacity mode. Two shards are  considered  adjacent  if
       the  union  of the hash key ranges for the two shards form a contiguous
       set with no gaps. For example, if you have two shards, one with a  hash
       key  range  of  276...381  and  the  other  with  a  hash  key range of
       382...454, then you could merge these two shards into  a  single  shard
       that  would  have  a  hash key range of 276...454. After the merge, the
       single child shard receives data for all hash key values covered by the
       two parent shards.

       NOTE:
              When  invoking this API, it is recommended you use the StreamARN
              input parameter rather than the StreamName input parameter.

          MergeShards is called when there is a need to reduce the overall ca-
          pacity  of  a  stream  because  of excess capacity that is not being
          used. You must specify the shard to be merged and the adjacent shard
          for  a  stream. For more information about merging shards, see Merge
          Two Shards in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide .

       If the stream is in the ACTIVE state, you can call MergeShards .  If  a
       stream  is  in the CREATING , UPDATING , or DELETING state, MergeShards
       returns a ResourceInUseException . If the specified stream does not ex-
       ist, MergeShards returns a ResourceNotFoundException .

       You  can  use   DescribeStreamSummary to check the state of the stream,
       which is returned in StreamStatus .
          MergeShards is an asynchronous operation. Upon  receiving  a  Merge-
          Shards  request,  Amazon  Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns a
          response and sets the StreamStatus to UPDATING . After the operation
          is completed, Kinesis Data Streams sets the StreamStatus to ACTIVE .
          Read and write operations continue to work while the  stream  is  in
          the UPDATING state.

       You  use   DescribeStreamSummary  and the  ListShards APIs to determine
       the shard IDs that are specified in the MergeShards request.

       If you try to operate on too many streams  in  parallel  using   Creat-
       eStream  ,  DeleteStream , MergeShards , or  SplitShard , you receive a
       LimitExceededException .
          MergeShards has a limit of five transactions per second per account.

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The name of the stream for the merge.

       --shard-to-merge (string)
          The shard ID of the shard to combine with the adjacent shard for the
          merge.

       --adjacent-shard-to-merge (string)
          The shard ID of the adjacent shard for the merge.

       --stream-arn (string)
          The ARN of the stream.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To merge shards

       The  following merge-shards example merges two adjacent shards with IDs
       of shardId-000000000000  and shardId-000000000001 in the specified data
       stream and combines them into a single shard.

          aws kinesis merge-shards \
              --stream-name samplestream \
              --shard-to-merge shardId-000000000000 \
              --adjacent-shard-to-merge shardId-000000000001

       This command produces no output.

       Streams Developer Guide.
