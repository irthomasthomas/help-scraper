INCREASE-STREAM-RETENTION-PERIOD()          INCREASE-STREAM-RETENTION-PERIOD()



NAME
       increase-stream-retention-period -

DESCRIPTION
       Increases  the  Kinesis  data  stream's  retention period, which is the
       length of time data records are accessible after they are added to  the
       stream.  The maximum value of a stream's retention period is 8760 hours
       (365 days).

       NOTE:
          When invoking this API, you must use either  the  StreamARN  or  the
          StreamName  parameter,  or  both. It is recommended that you use the
          StreamARN input parameter when you invoke this API.

       If you choose a longer stream  retention  period,  this  operation  in-
       creases  the time period during which records that have not yet expired
       are accessible. However, it does not make previous, expired data (older
       than the stream's previous retention period) accessible after the oper-
       ation has been called. For example, if a stream's retention  period  is
       set  to  24 hours and is increased to 168 hours, any data that is older
       than 24 hours remains inaccessible to consumer applications.

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The name of the stream to modify.

       --retention-period-hours (integer)
          The new retention period of the stream, in hours. Must be more  than
          the current retention period.

       --stream-arn (string)
          The ARN of the stream.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To increase data stream retention period

       The following increase-stream-retention-period  example  increases  the
       retention  period (the length of time data records are accessible after
       they are added to the stream) of the specified stream to 168 hours.

          aws kinesis increase-stream-retention-period \
              --stream-name samplestream \
              --retention-period-hours 168

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Changing the Data  Retention  Period  in  the
       Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
