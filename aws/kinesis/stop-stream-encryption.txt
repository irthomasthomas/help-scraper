STOP-STREAM-ENCRYPTION()                              STOP-STREAM-ENCRYPTION()



NAME
       stop-stream-encryption -

DESCRIPTION
       Disables server-side encryption for a specified stream.

       NOTE:
          When  invoking this API, it is recommended you use the StreamARN in-
          put parameter rather than the StreamName input parameter.

       Stopping encryption is an asynchronous operation.  Upon  receiving  the
       request,  Kinesis  Data Streams returns immediately and sets the status
       of the stream to UPDATING . After the update is complete, Kinesis  Data
       Streams sets the status of the stream back to ACTIVE . Stopping encryp-
       tion normally takes a few seconds to complete, but it can take minutes.
       You can continue to read and write data to your stream while its status
       is UPDATING . Once the status of the stream is ACTIVE , records written
       to the stream are no longer encrypted by Kinesis Data Streams.

       API  Limits:  You  can  successfully  disable server-side encryption 25
       times in a rolling 24-hour period.

       Note: It can take up to 5 seconds after the stream is in an ACTIVE sta-
       tus  before  all records written to the stream are no longer subject to
       encryption. After you disabled encryption, you can verify that  encryp-
       tion  is  not  applied by inspecting the API response from PutRecord or
       PutRecords .

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The name of the stream on which to stop encrypting records.

       --encryption-type (string)
          The encryption type. The only valid value is KMS .

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o KMS

       --key-id (string)
          The GUID for the customer-managed Amazon Web Services KMS key to use
          for  encryption.  This  value can be a globally unique identifier, a
          fully specified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to either an alias  or  a
          key, or an alias name prefixed by "alias/".You can also use a master
          key owned by Kinesis Data Streams by specifying the alias  aws/kine-
          sis .

          o Key                          ARN                          example:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

          o Alias                         ARN                         example:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName

          o Globally         unique          key          ID          example:
            12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

          o Alias name example: alias/MyAliasName

          o Master key owned by Kinesis Data Streams: alias/aws/kinesis

       --stream-arn (string)
          The ARN of the stream.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To disable data stream encryption

       The  following  stop-stream-encryption example disables server-side en-
       cryption for the specified stream, using the specified AWS KMS key.

          aws kinesis start-stream-encryption \
              --encryption-type KMS \
              --key-id arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:012345678912:key/a3c4a7cd-728b-45dd-b334-4d3eb496e452 \
              --stream-name samplestream

       This command produces no output.

       For more information,  see  Data  Protection  in  Amazon  Kinesis  Data
       Streams in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
