REGISTER-STREAM-CONSUMER()                          REGISTER-STREAM-CONSUMER()



NAME
       register-stream-consumer -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers  a consumer with a Kinesis data stream. When you use this op-
       eration, the consumer you register can then call   SubscribeToShard  to
       receive data from the stream using enhanced fan-out, at a rate of up to
       2 MiB per second for every shard you subscribe to. This rate  is  unaf-
       fected by the total number of consumers that read from the same stream.

       You  can  register  up to 20 consumers per stream. A given consumer can
       only be registered with one stream at a time.

       For an example of how to use this operation, see Enhanced Fan-Out Using
       the Kinesis Data Streams API .

       The  use  of this operation has a limit of five transactions per second
       per account. Also, only 5 consumers can be created  simultaneously.  In
       other words, you cannot have more than 5 consumers in a CREATING status
       at the same time. Registering a 6th consumer while there  are  5  in  a
       CREATING status results in a LimitExceededException .

OPTIONS
       --stream-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of  the  Kinesis data stream that you want to register the
          consumer with. For more info, see Amazon Resource Names  (ARNs)  and
          Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces .

       --consumer-name (string)
          For  a  given  Kinesis data stream, each consumer must have a unique
          name. However, consumer names don't have to be  unique  across  data
          streams.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To register a data stream consumer

       The following register-stream-consumer  example  registers  a  consumer
       called KinesisConsumerApplication with the specified data stream.

          aws kinesis register-stream-consumer \
              --stream-arn arn:aws:kinesis:us-west-2:012345678912:stream/samplestream \
              --consumer-name KinesisConsumerApplication

       Output:

          {
              "Consumer": {
                  "ConsumerName": "KinesisConsumerApplication",
                  "ConsumerARN": "arn:aws:kinesis:us-west-2: 123456789012:stream/samplestream/consumer/KinesisConsumerApplication:1572383852",
                  "ConsumerStatus": "CREATING",
                  "ConsumerCreationTimestamp": 1572383852.0
              }
          }

       Using the Kinesis Data Streams API in the Amazon Kinesis  Data  Streams
       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Consumer -> (structure)
          An  object  that  represents  the details of the consumer you regis-
          tered. When you register a consumer, it gets an ARN that  is  gener-
          ated by Kinesis Data Streams.

          ConsumerName -> (string)
              The name of the consumer is something you choose when you regis-
              ter the consumer.

          ConsumerARN -> (string)
              When you register a consumer, Kinesis Data Streams generates  an
              ARN  for  it.  You  need  this  ARN to be able to call  Subscri-
              beToShard .

              If you delete a consumer and then create a new one with the same
              name,  it  won't have the same ARN. That's because consumer ARNs
              contain the creation timestamp. This is  important  to  keep  in
              mind if you have IAM policies that reference consumer ARNs.

          ConsumerStatus -> (string)
              A  consumer  can't  read  data while in the CREATING or DELETING
              states.

          ConsumerCreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
