LIST-SHARDS()                                                    LIST-SHARDS()



NAME
       list-shards -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the shards in a stream and provides information about each shard.
       This operation has a limit of 1000 transactions  per  second  per  data
       stream.

       NOTE:
          When  invoking  this  API,  you must use either the StreamARN or the
          StreamName parameter, or both. It is recommended that  you  use  the
          StreamARN input parameter when you invoke this API.

       This action does not list expired shards. For information about expired
       shards, see Data Routing, Data Persistence, and Shard State after a Re-
       shard .

       WARNING:
          This  API  is  a  new  operation  that is used by the Amazon Kinesis
          Client Library (KCL). If you have a  fine-grained  IAM  policy  that
          only  allows specific operations, you must update your policy to al-
          low calls to this API. For more information, see Controlling  Access
          to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Resources Using IAM .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-shards  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Shards

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The name of the data stream whose shards you want to list.

          You cannot specify this parameter if you specify the  NextToken  pa-
          rameter.

       --exclusive-start-shard-id (string)
          Specify  this parameter to indicate that you want to list the shards
          starting with the shard whose  ID  immediately  follows  ExclusiveS-
          tartShardId .

          If  you  don't  specify  this parameter, the default behavior is for
          ListShards to list the shards starting with the  first  one  in  the
          stream.

          You cannot specify this parameter if you specify NextToken .

       --stream-creation-timestamp (timestamp)
          Specify  this  input parameter to distinguish data streams that have
          the same name. For example, if you create a  data  stream  and  then
          delete  it,  and  you later create another data stream with the same
          name, you can use this input parameter to specify which of  the  two
          streams you want to list the shards for.

          You  cannot  specify this parameter if you specify the NextToken pa-
          rameter.

       --shard-filter (structure)
          Enables you to filter out the response of the  ListShards  API.  You
          can only specify one filter at a time.

          If  you  use  the ShardFilter parameter when invoking the ListShards
          API, the Type is the required property and must be specified. If you
          specify  the  AT_TRIM_HORIZON  ,  FROM_TRIM_HORIZON  ,  or AT_LATEST
          types, you do not need to specify either the ShardId  or  the  Time-
          stamp optional properties.

          If  you  specify  the AFTER_SHARD_ID type, you must also provide the
          value for the optional ShardId property.  The  ShardId  property  is
          identical  in fuctionality to the ExclusiveStartShardId parameter of
          the ListShards API. When ShardId property is specified, the response
          includes  the  shards  starting  with the shard whose ID immediately
          follows the ShardId that you provided.

          If you specify the AT_TIMESTAMP or FROM_TIMESTAMP_ID type, you  must
          also  provide  the value for the optional Timestamp property. If you
          specify the AT_TIMESTAMP type, then all shards that were open at the
          provided  timestamp  are returned. If you specify the FROM_TIMESTAMP
          type, then all shards starting from the provided  timestamp  to  TIP
          are returned.

          Type -> (string)
              The shard type specified in the ShardFilter parameter. This is a
              required property of the ShardFilter parameter.

              You can specify the following valid values:

              o AFTER_SHARD_ID - the response includes all the shards,  start-
                ing  with  the  shard whose ID immediately follows the ShardId
                that you provided.

              o AT_TRIM_HORIZON - the response includes all  the  shards  that
                were open at TRIM_HORIZON .

              o FROM_TRIM_HORIZON  -  (default), the response includes all the
                shards within the retention period of the data stream (trim to
                tip).

              o AT_LATEST  -  the  response  includes  only the currently open
                shards of the data stream.

              o AT_TIMESTAMP - the response includes all  shards  whose  start
                timestamp is less than or equal to the given timestamp and end
                timestamp is greater than or equal to the given  timestamp  or
                still open.

              o FROM_TIMESTAMP - the response incldues all closed shards whose
                end timestamp is greater than or equal to the given  timestamp
                and  also  all  open  shards. Corrected to TRIM_HORIZON of the
                data stream if FROM_TIMESTAMP is less  than  the  TRIM_HORIZON
                value.

          ShardId -> (string)
              The  exclusive start shardID speified in the ShardFilter parame-
              ter. This property can only be used if the AFTER_SHARD_ID  shard
              type is specified.

          Timestamp -> (timestamp)
              The  timestamps  specified in the ShardFilter parameter. A time-
              stamp is a Unix epoch date with precision in  milliseconds.  For
              example,  2016-04-04T19:58:46.480-00:00  or 1459799926.480. This
              property can only be  used  if  FROM_TIMESTAMP  or  AT_TIMESTAMP
              shard types are specified.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,ShardId=string,Timestamp=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Type": "AFTER_SHARD_ID"|"AT_TRIM_HORIZON"|"FROM_TRIM_HORIZON"|"AT_LATEST"|"AT_TIMESTAMP"|"FROM_TIMESTAMP",
            "ShardId": "string",
            "Timestamp": timestamp
          }

       --stream-arn (string)
          The ARN of the stream.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list shards in a data stream

       The following list-shards example lists all  shards  in  the  specified
       stream  starting with the shard whose ID immediately follows the speci-
       fied exclusive-start-shard-id of shardId-000000000000.

          aws kinesis list-shards \
              --stream-name samplestream \
              --exclusive-start-shard-id shardId-000000000000

OUTPUT
       Shards -> (list)
          An array of JSON objects. Each object represents one shard and spec-
          ifies the IDs of the shard, the shard's parent, and the shard that's
          adjacent to the shard's parent. Each object also contains the start-
          ing and ending hash keys and the starting and ending  sequence  num-
          bers for the shard.

          (structure)
              A  uniquely  identified  group of data records in a Kinesis data
              stream.

              ShardId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the shard within the stream.

              ParentShardId -> (string)
                 The shard ID of the shard's parent.

              AdjacentParentShardId -> (string)
                 The shard ID of the shard adjacent to the shard's parent.

              HashKeyRange -> (structure)
                 The range of possible hash key values for the shard, which is
                 a set of ordered contiguous positive integers.

                 StartingHashKey -> (string)
                     The starting hash key of the hash key range.

                 EndingHashKey -> (string)
                     The ending hash key of the hash key range.

              SequenceNumberRange -> (structure)
                 The range of possible sequence numbers for the shard.

                 StartingSequenceNumber -> (string)
                     The starting sequence number for the range.

                 EndingSequenceNumber -> (string)
                     The ending sequence number for the range. Shards that are
                     in the OPEN state have an ending sequence number of  null
                     .

       NextToken -> (string)
          When the number of shards in the data stream is greater than the de-
          fault value for the MaxResults parameter, or if you explicitly spec-
          ify a value for MaxResults that is less than the number of shards in
          the data stream, the response  includes  a  pagination  token  named
          NextToken  .  You  can  specify this NextToken value in a subsequent
          call to ListShards to list the next set of shards. For more informa-
          tion  about  the use of this pagination token when calling the List-
          Shards operation, see  ListShardsInput$NextToken .

          WARNING:
              Tokens expire after 300 seconds. When you  obtain  a  value  for
              NextToken in the response to a call to ListShards , you have 300
              seconds to use that value. If you specify an expired token in  a
              call to ListShards , you get ExpiredNextTokenException .



                                                                 LIST-SHARDS()
