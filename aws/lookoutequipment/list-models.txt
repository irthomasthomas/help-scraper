OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          An opaque pagination token indicating where to continue the  listing
          of machine learning models.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the maximum number of machine learning models to list.

       --status (string)
          The status of the machine learning model.

          Possible values:

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o SUCCESS

          o FAILED

          o IMPORT_IN_PROGRESS

       --model-name-begins-with (string)
          The  beginning  of  the  name  of  the machine learning models being
          listed.

       --dataset-name-begins-with (string)
          The beginning of the name of the dataset  of  the  machine  learning
          models to be listed.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                        evaluation result file name. (bucket ).

                        When you call CreateModel or UpdateModel , specify the
                        path within the  bucket  that  you  want  Lookout  for
                        Equipment to save the model to. During training, Look-
                        out for Equipment creates the model  evaluation  model
                        as a compressed JSON file with the name model_diagnos-
                        tics_results.json.gz .

                        When you call DescribeModel or DescribeModelVersion  ,
                        prefix  contains  the  file  path  and filename of the
                        model evaluation file.

              ModelQuality -> (string)
                 Provides a quality assessment for a model that  uses  labels.
                 If Lookout for Equipment determines that the model quality is
                 poor based on training metrics, the value is POOR_QUALITY_DE-
                 TECTED . Otherwise, the value is QUALITY_THRESHOLD_MET .

                 If  the  model  is  unlabeled, the model quality can't be as-
                 sessed  and  the  value  of  ModelQuality  is   CANNOT_DETER-
                 MINE_QUALITY . In this situation, you can get a model quality
                 assessment by adding labels to the input dataset and retrain-
                 ing the model.

                 For  information  about  using  labels  with your models, see
                 Understanding labeling .
