OPTIONS
       --model-name (string)
          The name of the machine learning model that this version belongs to.

       --model-version (long)
          The version of the machine learning model.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

       DataPreProcessingConfiguration -> (structure)
          The  configuration is the TargetSamplingRate , which is the sampling
          rate of the data after post processing by Amazon Lookout for  Equip-
          ment.  For example, if you provide data that has been collected at a
          1 second level and you want the system to resample the data at  a  1
          minute rate before training, the TargetSamplingRate is 1 minute.

          When  providing a value for the TargetSamplingRate , you must attach
          the prefix "PT" to the rate you want. The value for a 1 second  rate
          is  therefore  PT1S  , the value for a 15 minute rate is PT15M , and
          the value for a 1 hour rate is PT1H

          TargetSamplingRate -> (string)
              The sampling rate of the data after post  processing  by  Amazon
              Lookout for Equipment. For example, if you provide data that has
              been collected at a 1 second level and you want  the  system  to
              resample  the  data at a 1 minute rate before training, the Tar-
              getSamplingRate is 1 minute.

              When providing a value for the TargetSamplingRate , you must at-
              tach  the  prefix  "PT"  to the rate you want. The value for a 1
              second rate is therefore PT1S , the value for a 15  minute  rate
              is PT15M , and the value for a 1 hour rate is PT1H

       TrainingExecutionStartTime -> (timestamp)
          The time when the training of the version began.

       TrainingExecutionEndTime -> (timestamp)
          The time when the training of the version completed.

       FailedReason -> (string)
          The failure message if the training of the model version failed.

       ModelMetrics -> (string)
          Shows  an aggregated summary, in JSON format, of the model's perfor-
          mance within the evaluation time range. These  metrics  are  created
          when evaluating the model.

       LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)

          by Amazon Lookout for Equipment.

       OffCondition -> (string)
          Indicates that the asset associated with this sensor has  been  shut
          off.  As  long  as this condition is met, Lookout for Equipment will
          not use data from this asset for training, evaluation, or inference.

       SourceModelVersionArn -> (string)
          If model version was imported, then this field is  the  arn  of  the
          source model version.

       ImportJobStartTime -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and time when the import job began. This field appears if
          the model version was imported.

       ImportJobEndTime -> (timestamp)

          if the model version was imported.

       ImportedDataSizeInBytes -> (long)
          The  size  in  bytes of the imported data. This field appears if the
          model version was imported.

       PriorModelMetrics -> (string)
          If the model version was retrained, this field shows  a  summary  of
          the  performance  of  the prior model on the new training range. You
          can use the information in this JSON-formatted object to compare the
          new model version and the prior model version.

       RetrainingAvailableDataInDays -> (integer)
          Indicates  the number of days of data used in the most recent sched-

       AutoPromotionResult -> (string)
          Indicates whether the model version was promoted to  be  the  active
          version  after retraining or if there was an error with or cancella-
          tion of the retraining.

       AutoPromotionResultReason -> (string)
          Indicates the reason for the AutoPromotionResult .  For  example,  a
          model  might  not  be promoted if its performance was worse than the
          active version, if there was an error during training, or if the re-
          training  scheduler was using MANUAL promote mode. The model will be
          promoted in MANAGED promote mode if the performance is  better  than
          the previous model.

       ModelDiagnosticsOutputConfiguration -> (structure)
          The  Amazon S3 location where Amazon Lookout for Equipment saves the
          pointwise model diagnostics for the model version.

          S3OutputConfiguration -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 location for the pointwise model diagnostics.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where  the  pointwise  model
                 diagnostics  are located. You must be the owner of the Amazon
                 S3 bucket.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 prefix for the location of the pointwise  model
                 diagnostics.  The  prefix specifies the folder and evaluation
                 result file name. (bucket ).

                 When you call CreateModel or UpdateModel , specify  the  path
                 within the bucket that you want Lookout for Equipment to save
                 the model to. During training, Lookout for Equipment  creates
                 the model evaluation model as a compressed JSON file with the
                 name model_diagnostics_results.json.gz .

                 When you call DescribeModel or DescribeModelVersion ,  prefix
                 contains  the  file path and filename of the model evaluation
                 file.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) key identi-
              fier to encrypt the pointwise model diagnostics files.

          the pointwise model diagnostics for the model version.

          Bucket -> (string)
              The name of the specific S3 bucket.

          Key -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS key) key be-
              ing used to encrypt the S3 object. Without this key, data in the
              bucket is not accessible.

       ModelQuality -> (string)
          Provides a quality assessment for a model that uses labels. If Look-
          out for Equipment determines that the model quality is poor based on
          training metrics, the value is  POOR_QUALITY_DETECTED  .  Otherwise,
          the value is QUALITY_THRESHOLD_MET .

          If  the  model is unlabeled, the model quality can't be assessed and
          the value of ModelQuality is CANNOT_DETERMINE_QUALITY . In this sit-
          uation,  you  can get a model quality assessment by adding labels to
          the input dataset and retraining the model.
