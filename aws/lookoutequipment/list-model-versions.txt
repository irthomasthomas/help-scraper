       Generates a list of all model versions for a given model, including the
       model version, model version ARN, and status. To list a subset of  ver-
       sions, use the MaxModelVersion and MinModelVersion fields.

OPTIONS
       --model-name (string)
          Then name of the machine learning model for which the model versions
          are to be listed.

       --next-token (string)
          If the total number of results exceeds the limit that  the  response
          can  display,  the response returns an opaque pagination token indi-
          cating where to continue the listing of machine learning model  ver-
          sions.  Use this token in the NextToken field in the request to list
          the next page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the maximum number of machine learning model  versions  to
          list.

       --status (string)
          Filter the results based on the current status of the model version.

          Possible values:

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o SUCCESS

          o FAILED

          o IMPORT_IN_PROGRESS

          o CANCELED

       --source-type (string)
          Filter the results based on the way the model version was generated.

          Possible values:

          o TRAINING

          o RETRAINING

          o IMPORT

       --created-at-end-time (timestamp)
          Filter  results to return all the model versions created before this
          time.

       --created-at-start-time (timestamp)
          Filter results to return all the model versions created  after  this
          time.

       --max-model-version (long)
          Specifies the highest version of the model to return in the list.

       --min-model-version (long)
          Specifies the lowest version of the model to return in the list.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If the total number of results exceeds the limit that  the  response
          can  display,  the response returns an opaque pagination token indi-
          cating where to continue the listing of machine learning model  ver-
          sions.  Use this token in the NextToken field in the request to list
          the next page of results.

       ModelVersionSummaries -> (list)
          Provides information on the specified model version,  including  the
          created time, model and dataset ARNs, and status.

          (structure)
              Contains information about the specific model version.

              ModelName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the model that this model version is a version
                 of.

              ModelArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the model that  this  model
                 version is a version of.

              ModelVersion -> (long)
                 The version of the model.

              ModelVersionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the model version.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time when this model version was created.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of the model version.

              SourceType -> (string)
                 Indicates how this model version was generated.
