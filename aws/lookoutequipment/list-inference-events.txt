LIST-INFERENCE-EVENTS()                                LIST-INFERENCE-EVENTS()



NAME
       list-inference-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  inference events that have been found for the specified in-
       ference scheduler.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-inference-events
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          --inference-scheduler-name <value>
          --interval-start-time <value>
          --interval-end-time <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          An opaque pagination token indicating where to continue the  listing
          of inference events.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the maximum number of inference events to list.

       --inference-scheduler-name (string)
          The name of the inference scheduler for the inference events listed.

       --interval-start-time (timestamp)
          Lookout  for  Equipment  will  return  all the inference events with
          start time equal to or greater than the start time given.

       --interval-end-time (timestamp)
          Lookout for Equipment will return all the inference events with  end
          time equal to or less than the end time given.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          An opaque pagination token indicating where to continue the  listing
          of inference executions.

       InferenceEventSummaries -> (list)
          Provides  an  array  of  information  about the individual inference
          events returned from the  ListInferenceEvents  operation,  including
          scheduler  used,  event start time, event end time, diagnostics, and
          so on.

          (structure)
              Contains information about the specific inference event, includ-
              ing  start and end time, diagnostics information, event duration
              and so on.

              InferenceSchedulerArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the inference scheduler be-
                 ing used for the inference event.

              InferenceSchedulerName -> (string)
                 The name of the inference scheduler being used for the infer-
                 ence events.

              EventStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 Indicates the starting time of an inference event.

              EventEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 Indicates the ending time of an inference event.

              Diagnostics -> (string)
                 An array which specifies the names and values of all  sensors
                 contributing to an inference event.

              EventDurationInSeconds -> (long)
                 Indicates the size of an inference event in seconds.
