OPTIONS
       --model-name (string)
          The name of the ML model to be described.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          ing its S3 location.

          S3InputConfiguration -> (structure)

              The name of the label group to be used for label data.

       TrainingDataStartTime -> (timestamp)
          Indicates the time reference in the dataset that was used  to  begin
          the subset of training data for the ML model.

       TrainingDataEndTime -> (timestamp)
          Indicates the time reference in the dataset that was used to end the
          subset of training data for the ML model.

       EvaluationDataStartTime -> (timestamp)
          Indicates the time reference in the dataset that was used  to  begin
          the subset of evaluation data for the ML model.

       EvaluationDataEndTime -> (timestamp)

       RoleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a role with permission  to  access
          the data source for the ML model being described.

       DataPreProcessingConfiguration -> (structure)
          The  configuration is the TargetSamplingRate , which is the sampling
          rate of the data after post processing by Amazon Lookout for  Equip-
          ment.  For example, if you provide data that has been collected at a
          1 second level and you want the system to resample the data at  a  1
          minute rate before training, the TargetSamplingRate is 1 minute.

          When  providing a value for the TargetSamplingRate , you must attach
          the prefix "PT" to the rate you want. The value for a 1 second  rate
          is  therefore  PT1S  , the value for a 15 minute rate is PT15M , and
          the value for a 1 hour rate is PT1H

          TargetSamplingRate -> (string)
              The sampling rate of the data after post  processing  by  Amazon
              Lookout for Equipment. For example, if you provide data that has
              been collected at a 1 second level and you want  the  system  to
              resample  the  data at a 1 minute rate before training, the Tar-
              getSamplingRate is 1 minute.

              When providing a value for the TargetSamplingRate , you must at-
              tach  the  prefix  "PT"  to the rate you want. The value for a 1
              second rate is therefore PT1S , the value for a 15  minute  rate
              is PT15M , and the value for a 1 hour rate is PT1H

       Status -> (string)
          Specifies  the  current  status of the model being described. Status
          describes the status of the most recent action of the model.

       TrainingExecutionStartTime -> (timestamp)
          Indicates the time at which the training of the ML model began.

       TrainingExecutionEndTime -> (timestamp)
          Indicates the time at which the training of the ML  model  was  com-
          pleted.

       FailedReason -> (string)
          If  the  training  of the ML model failed, this indicates the reason
          for that failure.

       ModelMetrics -> (string)
          The Model Metrics show an aggregated summary of the model's  perfor-
          mance  within the evaluation time range. This is the JSON content of
          the metrics created when evaluating the model.

       LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
          Indicates the last time the ML model was updated. The type of update
          is not specified.

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          Indicates the time and date at which the ML model was created.

       ServerSideKmsKeyId -> (string)
          Provides the identifier of the KMS key used to encrypt model data by
          Amazon Lookout for Equipment.

       OffCondition -> (string)
          Indicates that the asset associated with this sensor has  been  shut
          off.  As  long  as this condition is met, Lookout for Equipment will
          not use data from this asset for training, evaluation, or inference.
