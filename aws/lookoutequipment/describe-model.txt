OPTIONS
       --model-name (string)
          The name of the machine learning model to be described.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

       DataPreProcessingConfiguration -> (structure)
          The  configuration is the TargetSamplingRate , which is the sampling
          rate of the data after post processing by Amazon Lookout for  Equip-
          ment.  For example, if you provide data that has been collected at a
          1 second level and you want the system to resample the data at  a  1
          minute rate before training, the TargetSamplingRate is 1 minute.

          When  providing a value for the TargetSamplingRate , you must attach
          the prefix "PT" to the rate you want. The value for a 1 second  rate
          is  therefore  PT1S  , the value for a 15 minute rate is PT15M , and
          the value for a 1 hour rate is PT1H

          TargetSamplingRate -> (string)

              been collected at a 1 second level and you want  the  system  to
              resample  the  data at a 1 minute rate before training, the Tar-
              getSamplingRate is 1 minute.

              When providing a value for the TargetSamplingRate , you must at-
              tach  the  prefix  "PT"  to the rate you want. The value for a 1
              second rate is therefore PT1S , the value for a 15  minute  rate
              is PT15M , and the value for a 1 hour rate is PT1H

                 diagnostics.  The  prefix specifies the folder and evaluation
                 result file name. (bucket ).

                 When you call CreateModel or UpdateModel , specify  the  path
                 within the bucket that you want Lookout for Equipment to save
                 the model to. During training, Lookout for Equipment  creates
                 the model evaluation model as a compressed JSON file with the

       ModelQuality -> (string)
          Provides a quality assessment for a model that uses labels. If Look-
          out for Equipment determines that the model quality is poor based on
          training  metrics,  the  value is POOR_QUALITY_DETECTED . Otherwise,
          the value is QUALITY_THRESHOLD_MET .

          If the model is unlabeled, the model quality can't be  assessed  and
          the value of ModelQuality is CANNOT_DETERMINE_QUALITY . In this sit-
          uation, you can get a model quality assessment by adding  labels  to
          the input dataset and retraining the model.

          Understanding labeling .
