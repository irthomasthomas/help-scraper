CREATE-MODEL()                                                  CREATE-MODEL()



NAME
       create-model -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a machine learning model for data inference.

       A  machine-learning  (ML) model is a mathematical model that finds pat-
       terns in your data. In Amazon Lookout for Equipment, the  model  learns
       the  patterns  of  normal  behavior  and detects abnormal behavior that
       could be potential equipment failure (or maintenance events). The  mod-
       els  are made by analyzing normal data and abnormalities in machine be-
       havior that have already occurred.

       Your model is trained using a portion of the data from your dataset and
       uses  that  data to learn patterns of normal behavior and abnormal pat-
       terns that lead to equipment failure. Another portion of  the  data  is
       used to evaluate the model's accuracy.

            },
            "LabelGroupName": "string"
          }

       --client-token (string)
          A unique identifier for the request. If you do not  set  the  client
          request token, Amazon Lookout for Equipment generates one.

       --training-data-start-time (timestamp)
          Indicates  the  time reference in the dataset that should be used to
          begin the subset of training data for the machine learning model.

          end the subset of training data for the machine learning model.

       --evaluation-data-start-time (timestamp)
          Indicates  the  time reference in the dataset that should be used to
          begin the subset of evaluation data for the machine learning model.

       --evaluation-data-end-time (timestamp)

       --role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of a role with permission to access
          the data source being used to create the machine learning model.

       --data-pre-processing-configuration (structure)
          The configuration is the TargetSamplingRate , which is the  sampling
          rate  of the data after post processing by Amazon Lookout for Equip-
          ment. For example, if you provide data that has been collected at  a
          1  second  level and you want the system to resample the data at a 1
          minute rate before training, the TargetSamplingRate is 1 minute.

          When providing a value for the TargetSamplingRate , you must  attach
          the  prefix "PT" to the rate you want. The value for a 1 second rate
          is therefore PT1S , the value for a 15 minute rate is  PT15M  ,  and
          the value for a 1 hour rate is PT1H

          TargetSamplingRate -> (string)
              The  sampling  rate  of the data after post processing by Amazon
              Lookout for Equipment. For example, if you provide data that has
              been  collected  at  a 1 second level and you want the system to
              resample the data at a 1 minute rate before training,  the  Tar-
              getSamplingRate is 1 minute.

              When providing a value for the TargetSamplingRate , you must at-
              tach the prefix "PT" to the rate you want. The  value  for  a  1
              second  rate  is therefore PT1S , the value for a 15 minute rate
              is PT15M , and the value for a 1 hour rate is PT1H

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TargetSamplingRate=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TargetSamplingRate": "PT1S"|"PT5S"|"PT10S"|"PT15S"|"PT30S"|"PT1M"|"PT5M"|"PT10M"|"PT15M"|"PT30M"|"PT1H"
          }

          ]

       --off-condition (string)
          Indicates that the asset associated with this sensor has  been  shut

                 S3 bucket.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 prefix for the location of the pointwise  model
                 diagnostics.  The  prefix specifies the folder and evaluation
                 result file name. (bucket ).

                 When you call CreateModel or UpdateModel , specify  the  path
                 within the bucket that you want Lookout for Equipment to save
                 the model to. During training, Lookout for Equipment  creates
                 the model evaluation model as a compressed JSON file with the
                 name model_diagnostics_results.json.gz .

                 When you call DescribeModel or DescribeModelVersion ,  prefix
                 contains  the  file path and filename of the model evaluation
                 file.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)

          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
