LIST-SENSOR-STATISTICS()                              LIST-SENSOR-STATISTICS()



NAME
       list-sensor-statistics -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  statistics about the data collected for each of the sensors that
       have been successfully ingested in the particular dataset. Can also  be
       used to retreive Sensor Statistics for a previous ingestion job.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-sensor-statistics
          --dataset-name <value>
          [--ingestion-job-id <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dataset-name (string)
          The  name  of the dataset associated with the list of Sensor Statis-
          tics.

       --ingestion-job-id (string)
          The ingestion job id associated with the list of Sensor  Statistics.
          To  get  sensor  statistics  for a particular ingestion job id, both
          dataset name and ingestion job id must be submitted as inputs.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the maximum number of sensors for which to  retrieve  sta-
          tistics.

       --next-token (string)
          An  opaque pagination token indicating where to continue the listing
          of sensor statistics.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
