OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Channel name.

       --latency-mode (string)
          Channel latency mode. Use NORMAL to broadcast and deliver live video
          up to Full HD. Use LOW for near-real-time interaction with  viewers.
          Default: LOW .

          Possible values:

          o NORMAL

          o LOW

       --type (string)
          Channel type, which determines the allowable resolution and bitrate.
          If you exceed the allowable input resolution or bitrate, the  stream
          probably  will  disconnect  immediately. Default: STANDARD . For de-
          tails, see Channel Types .

          Possible values:

          o BASIC

          o STANDARD

          o ADVANCED_SD

          o ADVANCED_HD

       --authorized | --no-authorized (boolean)
          Whether the channel is private (enabled for playback authorization).
          Default: false .

       --recording-configuration-arn (string)
          Recording-configuration  ARN.  A valid ARN value here both specifies
          the ARN and enables recording. Default: "" (empty string,  recording
          is disabled).

       --tags (map)
          Array of 1-50 maps, each of the form string:string (key:value) . See
          Best practices and strategies in Tagging  Amazon  Web  Services  Re-
          sources  and Tag Editor for details, including restrictions that ap-
          ply to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS has
          no service-specific constraints beyond what is documented there.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --insecure-ingest | --no-insecure-ingest (boolean)
          Whether  the  channel  allows insecure RTMP and SRT ingest. Default:
          false .

       --preset (string)
          Optional transcode preset for the channel. This is  selectable  only
          for  ADVANCED_HD  and  ADVANCED_SD  channel types. For those channel
          types, the default preset is HIGHER_BANDWIDTH_DELIVERY .  For  other
          channel  types (BASIC and STANDARD ), preset is the empty string (""
          ).

          Possible values:

          o HIGHER_BANDWIDTH_DELIVERY

          o CONSTRAINED_BANDWIDTH_DELIVERY

       --playback-restriction-policy-arn (string)
          Playback-restriction-policy ARN. A valid ARN value here both  speci-
          fies  the  ARN  and enables playback restriction. Default: "" (empty
          string, no playback restriction policy is applied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create a channel with no recording

       The following create-channel example creates a new channel and an asso-
       ciated stream key to start streaming.

          aws ivs create-channel \
              --name "test-channel" \
              --no-insecure-ingest

       Example  2:  To  create  a  channel  with  recording enabled, using the
       RecordingConfiguration resource specified by its ARN

       The following create-channel example creates a new channel and an asso-
       ciated  stream  key  to  start streaming, and sets up recording for the
       channel.

       ified by its ARN

       The following create-channel example creates a new channel and an asso-
       ciated  stream  key to start streaming, and sets up a playback restric-

OUTPUT
       channel -> (structure)
          arn -> (string)
              Channel ARN.

              DARD . For details, see Channel Types .

              fies  the  ARN and enables recording. Default: "" (empty string,
              recording is disabled).

          ingestEndpoint -> (string)
