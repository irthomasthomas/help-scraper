OPTIONS
       --authorized | --no-authorized (boolean)
          Whether the channel is private (enabled for playback authorization).
          Default: false .

       --latency-mode (string)
          Channel latency mode. Use NORMAL to broadcast and deliver live video
          up  to Full HD. Use LOW for near-real-time interaction with viewers.
          (Note: In the Amazon IVS console, LOW and NORMAL correspond  to  Ul-
          tra-low and Standard, respectively.) Default: LOW .

          Possible values:

          o NORMAL

          o LOW

       --name (string)
          Channel name.

       --recording-configuration-arn (string)
          Recording-configuration ARN. Default: "" (empty string, recording is
          disabled).

       --tags (map)
          Array of 1-50 maps, each of the form string:string (key:value) . See
          Tagging  Amazon Web Services Resources for more information, includ-
          ing restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits  and  re-
          quirements";  Amazon  IVS has no service-specific constraints beyond
          what is documented there.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --type (string)
          Channel type, which determines the allowable resolution and bitrate.
          If you exceed the allowable resolution or bitrate, the stream proba-
          bly will disconnect immediately. Default: STANDARD . Valid values:

          o STANDARD : Video is transcoded: multiple qualities  are  generated
            from  the  original  input, to automatically give viewers the best
            experience for their devices and network  conditions.  Transcoding
            allows  higher playback quality across a range of download speeds.
            Resolution can be up to 1080p and bitrate can be up to  8.5  Mbps.
            Audio  is  transcoded  only  for  renditions 360p and below; above
            that, audio is passed through. This is the default.

          o BASIC : Video is transmuxed: Amazon IVS delivers the original  in-
            put to viewers. The viewers video-quality choice is limited to the
            original input. Resolution can be up to 1080p and bitrate  can  be
            up to 1.5 Mbps for 480p and up to 3.5 Mbps for resolutions between
            480p and 1080p.

          Possible values:

          o BASIC

          o STANDARD

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create a channel with no recording

       The following create-channel example creates a new channel and an asso-
       ciated stream key to start streaming.

          aws ivs create-channel \
              -name "test-channel"

       Output:

          {
              "channel": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh",
                  "name": "test-channel",
                  "latencyMode": "LOW",
                  "recordingConfigurationArn": "",
                  "ingestEndpoint": "a1b2c3d4e5f6.global-contribute.live-video.net",
                  "playbackUrl": "https://a1b2c3d4e5f6.us-west-2.playback.live-video.net/api/video/v1/us-west-2.123456789012.channel.abcdEFGH.m3u8",
                  "tags": {}
              },
              "streamKey": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:stream-key/g1H2I3j4k5L6",
                  "value": "sk_us-west-2_abcdABCDefgh_567890abcdef",
                  "channelArn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh",
                  "tags": {}
              }
          }

       Video Service User Guide.

       Example 2: To create  a  channel  with  recording  enabled,  using  the
       RecordingConfiguration resource specified by its ARN

       The following create-channel example creates a new channel and an asso-
       ciated stream key to start streaming, and sets  up  recording  for  the
       channel.

          aws ivs create-channel \
              --name test-channel-with-recording \
              --recording-configuration-arn "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:recording-configuration/ABCD12cdEFgh"

       Output:

          {
              "channel": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh",
                  "name": "test-channel-with-recording",
                  "latencyMode": "LOW",
                  "type": "STANDARD",
                  "recordingConfigurationArn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:recording-configuration/ABCD12cdEFgh",
                  "ingestEndpoint": "a1b2c3d4e5f6.global-contribute.live-video.net",
                  "playbackUrl": "https://a1b2c3d4e5f6.us-west-2.playback.live-video.net/api/video/v1/us-west-2.123456789012.channel.abcdEFGH.m3u8",
                  "authorized": false,
                  "tags": {}
              },
              "streamKey": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:stream-key/abcdABCDefgh",
                  "value": "sk_us-west-2_abcdABCDefgh_567890abcdef",
                  "channelArn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh",
                  "tags": {}
              }
          }
