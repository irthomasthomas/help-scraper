OPTIONS
       --authorized | --no-authorized (boolean)
          Whether the channel is private (enabled for playback authorization).
          Default: false .

       --insecure-ingest | --no-insecure-ingest (boolean)
          Whether the channel allows insecure RTMP ingest. Default: false .

       --latency-mode (string)
          Channel latency mode. Use NORMAL to broadcast and deliver live video
          up  to Full HD. Use LOW for near-real-time interaction with viewers.
          (Note: In the Amazon IVS console, LOW and NORMAL correspond  to  Ul-
          tra-low and Standard, respectively.) Default: LOW .

          Possible values:

          o NORMAL

          o LOW

       --name (string)
          Channel name.

       --preset (string)
          Optional  transcode  preset for the channel. This is selectable only
          for ADVANCED_HD and ADVANCED_SD channel  types.  For  those  channel
          types,  the  default preset is HIGHER_BANDWIDTH_DELIVERY . For other
          channel types (BASIC and STANDARD ), preset is the empty string  (""
          ).

          Possible values:

          o HIGHER_BANDWIDTH_DELIVERY

          o CONSTRAINED_BANDWIDTH_DELIVERY

       --recording-configuration-arn (string)
          Recording-configuration ARN. Default: "" (empty string, recording is
          disabled).

       --tags (map)
          Array of 1-50 maps, each of the form string:string (key:value) . See
          Tagging  Amazon Web Services Resources for more information, includ-
          ing restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits  and  re-
          quirements";  Amazon  IVS has no service-specific constraints beyond
          what is documented there.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --type (string)
          Channel type, which determines the allowable resolution and bitrate.
          If  you exceed the allowable input resolution or bitrate, the stream
          probably will disconnect immediately. Some types  generate  multiple
          qualities  (renditions)  from the original input; this automatically
          gives viewers the best experience for their devices and network con-
          ditions.  Some  types  provide  transcoded video; transcoding allows
          higher playback quality across a range of download speeds.  Default:
          STANDARD . Valid values:

          o BASIC  : Video is transmuxed: Amazon IVS delivers the original in-
            put quality to viewers. The viewers video-quality choice  is  lim-
            ited  to  the  original input. Input resolution can be up to 1080p
            and bitrate can be up to 1.5 Mbps for 480p and up to 3.5 Mbps  for
            resolutions  between  480p  and  1080p.  Original  audio is passed
            through.

          o STANDARD : Video is transcoded: multiple qualities  are  generated
            from  the  original  input, to automatically give viewers the best
            experience for their devices and network  conditions.  Transcoding
            allows  higher playback quality across a range of download speeds.
            Resolution can be up to 1080p and bitrate can be up to  8.5  Mbps.
            Audio  is  transcoded  only  for  renditions 360p and below; above
            that, audio is passed through. This is the default when you create
            a channel.

          o ADVANCED_SD  :  Video is transcoded; multiple qualities are gener-
            ated from the original input, to automatically  give  viewers  the
            best  experience  for  their devices and network conditions. Input
            resolution can be up to 1080p and bitrate can be up to  8.5  Mbps;
            output  is capped at SD quality (480p). You can select an optional
            transcode  preset  (see  below).  Audio  for  all  renditions   is
            transcoded, and an audio-only rendition is available.

          o ADVANCED_HD  :  Video is transcoded; multiple qualities are gener-
            ated from the original input, to automatically  give  viewers  the
            best  experience  for  their devices and network conditions. Input
            resolution can be up to 1080p and bitrate can be up to  8.5  Mbps;
            output  is capped at HD quality (720p). You can select an optional
            transcode  preset  (see  below).  Audio  for  all  renditions   is
            transcoded, and an audio-only rendition is available.

          Optional  transcode presets (available for the ADVANCED types) allow
          you to trade off available download bandwidth and video quality,  to
          optimize the viewing experience. There are two presets:

          o Constrained bandwidth delivery uses a lower bitrate for each qual-
            ity level. Use it if you have low download bandwidth and/or simple
            video content (e.g., talking heads)

          o Higher  bandwidth  delivery uses a higher bitrate for each quality
            level. Use it if you have high download bandwidth  and/or  complex
            video content (e.g., flashes and quick scene changes).

          Possible values:

          o BASIC

          o STANDARD

          o ADVANCED_SD

          o ADVANCED_HD

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create a channel with no recording

       The following create-channel example creates a new channel and an asso-
       ciated stream key to start streaming.

          aws ivs create-channel \
              --name "test-channel" \
              --no-insecure-ingest

       Output:

          {
              "channel": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh",
                  "authorized": false,
                  "name": "test-channel",
                  "latencyMode": "LOW",
                  "recordingConfigurationArn": "",
                  "ingestEndpoint": "a1b2c3d4e5f6.global-contribute.live-video.net",
                  "insecureIngest": false,

                  "preset": "",
                  "tags": {},
                  "type": "STANDARD"
              },
              "streamKey": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:stream-key/g1H2I3j4k5L6",
                  "value": "sk_us-west-2_abcdABCDefgh_567890abcdef",
                  "channelArn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh",

       Video Service User Guide.

       Example  2:  To  create  a  channel  with  recording enabled, using the
       RecordingConfiguration resource specified by its ARN

       The following create-channel example creates a new channel and an asso-
       ciated  stream  key  to  start streaming, and sets up recording for the
       channel:

          aws ivs create-channel \
              --name test-channel-with-recording \
              --insecure-ingest \
              --recording-configuration-arn "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:recording-configuration/ABCD12cdEFgh"

       Output:

          {
              "channel": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh",
                  "name": "test-channel-with-recording",
                  "latencyMode": "LOW",
                  "type": "STANDARD",
                  "recordingConfigurationArn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:recording-configuration/ABCD12cdEFgh",
                  "ingestEndpoint": "a1b2c3d4e5f6.global-contribute.live-video.net",
                  "insecureIngest": true,
                  "playbackUrl": "https://a1b2c3d4e5f6.us-west-2.playback.live-video.net/api/video/v1/us-west-2.123456789012.channel.abcdEFGH.m3u8",
                  "preset": "",
                  "authorized": false,
                  "tags": {},
                  "type": "STANDARD"
              },
              "streamKey": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:stream-key/abcdABCDefgh",

OUTPUT
       channel -> (structure)
          arn -> (string)
              Channel ARN.

          authorized -> (boolean)
              Whether  the channel is private (enabled for playback authoriza-
              tion). Default: false .

          ingestEndpoint -> (string)
              Channel ingest endpoint, part of the  definition  of  an  ingest
              server, used when you set up streaming software.

          insecureIngest -> (boolean)
              Whether  the channel allows insecure RTMP ingest. Default: false
              .

          latencyMode -> (string)
              Channel latency mode. Use NORMAL to broadcast and  deliver  live
              video up to Full HD. Use LOW for near-real-time interaction with
              viewers. Default: LOW . (Note: In the Amazon  IVS  console,  LOW
              and NORMAL correspond to Ultra-low and Standard, respectively.)

          name -> (string)
              Channel name.

          playbackUrl -> (string)
              Channel playback URL.

          preset -> (string)
              Optional  transcode  preset  for the channel. This is selectable
              only for ADVANCED_HD and ADVANCED_SD channel  types.  For  those
              channel types, the default preset is HIGHER_BANDWIDTH_DELIVERY .
              For other channel types (BASIC and STANDARD  ),  preset  is  the
              empty string ("" ).

          recordingConfigurationArn -> (string)
              Recording-configuration  ARN. A value other than an empty string
              indicates that recording is enabled. Default: "" (empty  string,
              recording is disabled).

          tags -> (map)
              Tags  attached  to the resource. Array of 1-50 maps, each of the
              form string:string (key:value) . See Tagging Amazon Web Services
              Resources  for more information, including restrictions that ap-
              ply to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS
              has  no  service-specific  constraints beyond what is documented
              there.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          type -> (string)
              Channel type, which determines the allowable resolution and  bi-
              trate.  If you exceed the allowable input resolution or bitrate,
              the stream probably will disconnect immediately. Some types gen-
              erate  multiple  qualities (renditions) from the original input;
              this automatically gives viewers the best experience  for  their
              devices  and  network  conditions. Some types provide transcoded
              video; transcoding allows higher playback quality across a range
              of download speeds. Default: STANDARD . Valid values:

              o BASIC  : Video is transmuxed: Amazon IVS delivers the original
                input quality to viewers. The viewers video-quality choice  is
                limited  to  the original input. Input resolution can be up to
                1080p and bitrate can be up to 1.5 Mbps for 480p and up to 3.5
                Mbps for resolutions between 480p and 1080p. Original audio is
                passed through.

              o STANDARD : Video is transcoded: multiple qualities are  gener-
                ated  from  the  original input, to automatically give viewers
                the best experience for their devices and network  conditions.
                Transcoding  allows  higher playback quality across a range of
                download speeds. Resolution can be up to 1080p and bitrate can
                be  up  to  8.5  Mbps. Audio is transcoded only for renditions
                360p and below; above that, audio is passed through.  This  is
                the default when you create a channel.

              o ADVANCED_SD : Video is transcoded; multiple qualities are gen-
                erated from the original input, to automatically give  viewers
                the  best experience for their devices and network conditions.
                Input resolution can be up to 1080p and bitrate can be  up  to
                8.5  Mbps;  output is capped at SD quality (480p). You can se-
                lect an optional transcode preset (see below). Audio  for  all
                renditions  is  transcoded,  and  an  audio-only  rendition is
                available.

              o ADVANCED_HD : Video is transcoded; multiple qualities are gen-
                erated  from the original input, to automatically give viewers
                the best experience for their devices and network  conditions.
                Input  resolution  can be up to 1080p and bitrate can be up to
                8.5 Mbps; output is capped at HD quality (720p). You  can  se-
                lect  an  optional transcode preset (see below). Audio for all
                renditions is  transcoded,  and  an  audio-only  rendition  is
                available.

              Optional  transcode  presets  (available for the ADVANCED types)
              allow you to trade off available download  bandwidth  and  video
              quality,  to optimize the viewing experience. There are two pre-
              sets:

              o Constrained bandwidth delivery uses a lower bitrate  for  each
                quality  level.  Use  it  if  you  have low download bandwidth
                and/or simple video content (e.g., talking heads)

              o Higher bandwidth delivery uses a higher bitrate for each qual-
                ity  level.  Use it if you have high download bandwidth and/or
                complex video content (e.g., flashes and quick scene changes).

       streamKey -> (structure)
          arn -> (string)
              Stream-key ARN.

          channelArn -> (string)
