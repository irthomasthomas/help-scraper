DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the channel configuration for the specified channel ARN. See also

SYNOPSIS
            get-channel
          --arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          ARN of the channel for which the configuration is to be retrieved.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get a channel's configuration information

       The following get-channel example gets the channel configuration for  a
       specified channel ARN (Amazon Resource Name).

          aws ivs get-channel \
              --arn arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh

       Output:

          {
              "channel": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh",
                  "name": "channel-1",
                  "latencyMode": "LOW",
                  "type": "STANDARD",
                  "playbackRestrictionPolicyArn": "",
                  "preset": "",
                  "recordingConfigurationArn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:recording-configuration/ABCD12cdEFgh",
                  "ingestEndpoint": "a1b2c3d4e5f6.global-contribute.live-video.net",
                  "insecureIngest": false,
                  "playbackUrl": "https://a1b2c3d4e5f6.us-west-2.playback.live-video.net/api/video/v1/us-west-2.123456789012.channel.abcdEFGH.m3u8",
                  "tags": {}
              }
          }

       Guide.

OUTPUT
       channel -> (structure)
          arn -> (string)
              Channel ARN.

          authorized -> (boolean)
              Whether the channel is private (enabled for playback  authoriza-
              tion). Default: false .

          ingestEndpoint -> (string)
              Channel  ingest  endpoint,  part  of the definition of an ingest
              server, used when you set up streaming software.

          insecureIngest -> (boolean)
              Whether the channel allows insecure RTMP ingest. Default:  false
              .

          latencyMode -> (string)
              Channel  latency  mode. Use NORMAL to broadcast and deliver live
              video up to Full HD. Use LOW for near-real-time interaction with
              viewers. Default: LOW .

          name -> (string)
              Channel name.

          playbackRestrictionPolicyArn -> (string)
              Playback-restriction-policy  ARN.  A  valid  ARN value here both
              specifies the ARN and enables playback restriction. Default:  ""
              (empty string, no playback restriction policy is applied).

          playbackUrl -> (string)
              Channel playback URL.

          preset -> (string)
              Optional  transcode  preset  for the channel. This is selectable
              only for ADVANCED_HD and ADVANCED_SD channel  types.  For  those
              channel types, the default preset is HIGHER_BANDWIDTH_DELIVERY .
              For other channel types (BASIC and STANDARD  ),  preset  is  the
              empty string ("" ).

          recordingConfigurationArn -> (string)
              Recording-configuration  ARN. A valid ARN value here both speci-
              fies the ARN and enables recording. Default: ""  (empty  string,
              recording is disabled).

          srt -> (structure)
              Specifies  the  endpoint  and  optional passphrase for streaming
              with the SRT protocol.

              endpoint -> (string)
                 The endpoint to be used when streaming with IVS using the SRT
                 protocol.

              passphrase -> (string)
                 Auto-generated passphrase to enable encryption. This field is
                 applicable only if the end user has  not  enabled  the  inse-
                 cureIngest option for the channel.

              Tags  attached  to the resource. Array of 1-50 maps, each of the
              form string:string (key:value) . See Tagging Amazon Web Services
              Resources  for more information, including restrictions that ap-
              ply to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS
              has  no  service-specific  constraints beyond what is documented
              there.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          type -> (string)
              Channel type, which determines the allowable resolution and  bi-
              trate.  If you exceed the allowable input resolution or bitrate,
              the stream probably will disconnect immediately. Default:  STAN-
              DARD . For details, see Channel Types .
