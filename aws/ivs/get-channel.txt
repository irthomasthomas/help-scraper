SYNOPSIS
            get-channel
          --arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          ARN of the channel for which the configuration is to be retrieved.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get a channel's configuration information

       The following get-channel example gets the channel configuration for  a
       specified channel ARN (Amazon Resource Name).

          aws ivs get-channel \
              --arn arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh

       Output:

          {
              "channel": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh",
                  "name": "channel-1",
                  "latencyMode": "LOW",
                  "type": "STANDARD",
                  "recordingConfigurationArn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:recording-configuration/ABCD12cdEFgh",
                  "ingestEndpoint": "a1b2c3d4e5f6.global-contribute.live-video.net",
                  "insecureIngest": false,
                  "playbackUrl": "https://a1b2c3d4e5f6.us-west-2.playback.live-video.net/api/video/v1/us-west-2.123456789012.channel.abcdEFGH.m3u8",
                  "tags": {}
              }
          }

       Video Service User Guide.

OUTPUT
       channel -> (structure)
          arn -> (string)
              Channel ARN.

          authorized -> (boolean)
              Whether the channel is private (enabled for playback  authoriza-
              tion). Default: false .

          ingestEndpoint -> (string)
              Channel  ingest  endpoint,  part  of the definition of an ingest
              server, used when you set up streaming software.

          insecureIngest -> (boolean)
              Whether the channel allows insecure RTMP ingest. Default:  false
              .

          latencyMode -> (string)
              Channel  latency  mode. Use NORMAL to broadcast and deliver live
              video up to Full HD. Use LOW for near-real-time interaction with
              viewers.  Default:  LOW  . (Note: In the Amazon IVS console, LOW
              and NORMAL correspond to Ultra-low and Standard, respectively.)

          name -> (string)
              Channel name.

          playbackUrl -> (string)
              Channel playback URL.

          preset -> (string)
              Optional transcode preset for the channel.  This  is  selectable
              only  for  ADVANCED_HD  and ADVANCED_SD channel types. For those
              channel types, the default preset is HIGHER_BANDWIDTH_DELIVERY .
              For  other  channel  types  (BASIC and STANDARD ), preset is the
              empty string ("" ).

          recordingConfigurationArn -> (string)
              Recording-configuration ARN. A value other than an empty  string
              indicates  that recording is enabled. Default: "" (empty string,
              recording is disabled).

          tags -> (map)
              Tags attached to the resource. Array of 1-50 maps, each  of  the
              form string:string (key:value) . See Tagging Amazon Web Services
              Resources for more information, including restrictions that  ap-
              ply to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS
              has no service-specific constraints beyond  what  is  documented
              there.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          type -> (string)
              Channel  type, which determines the allowable resolution and bi-
              trate. If you exceed the allowable input resolution or  bitrate,
              the stream probably will disconnect immediately. Some types gen-
              erate multiple qualities (renditions) from the  original  input;
              this  automatically  gives viewers the best experience for their
              devices and network conditions. Some  types  provide  transcoded
              video; transcoding allows higher playback quality across a range
              of download speeds. Default: STANDARD . Valid values:

              o BASIC : Video is transmuxed: Amazon IVS delivers the  original
                input  quality to viewers. The viewers video-quality choice is
                limited to the original input. Input resolution can be  up  to
                1080p and bitrate can be up to 1.5 Mbps for 480p and up to 3.5
                Mbps for resolutions between 480p and 1080p. Original audio is
                passed through.

              o STANDARD  : Video is transcoded: multiple qualities are gener-
                ated from the original input, to  automatically  give  viewers
                the  best experience for their devices and network conditions.
                Transcoding allows higher playback quality across a  range  of
                download speeds. Resolution can be up to 1080p and bitrate can
                be up to 8.5 Mbps. Audio is  transcoded  only  for  renditions
                360p  and  below; above that, audio is passed through. This is
                the default when you create a channel.

              o ADVANCED_SD : Video is transcoded; multiple qualities are gen-
                erated  from the original input, to automatically give viewers
                the best experience for their devices and network  conditions.
                Input  resolution  can be up to 1080p and bitrate can be up to
                8.5 Mbps; output is capped at SD quality (480p). You  can  se-
                lect  an  optional transcode preset (see below). Audio for all
                renditions is  transcoded,  and  an  audio-only  rendition  is
                available.

              o ADVANCED_HD : Video is transcoded; multiple qualities are gen-
                erated from the original input, to automatically give  viewers
                the  best experience for their devices and network conditions.
                Input resolution can be up to 1080p and bitrate can be  up  to
                8.5  Mbps;  output is capped at HD quality (720p). You can se-
                lect an optional transcode preset (see below). Audio  for  all
                renditions  is  transcoded,  and  an  audio-only  rendition is
                available.

              Optional transcode presets (available for  the  ADVANCED  types)
              allow  you  to  trade off available download bandwidth and video
              quality, to optimize the viewing experience. There are two  pre-
              sets:

              o Constrained  bandwidth  delivery uses a lower bitrate for each
                quality level. Use it  if  you  have  low  download  bandwidth
                and/or simple video content (e.g., talking heads)

              o Higher bandwidth delivery uses a higher bitrate for each qual-
                ity level. Use it if you have high download  bandwidth  and/or
                complex video content (e.g., flashes and quick scene changes).
