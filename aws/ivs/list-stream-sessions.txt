LIST-STREAM-SESSIONS()                                  LIST-STREAM-SESSIONS()



NAME
       list-stream-sessions -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a summary of current and previous streams for a specified channel
       in your account, in the AWS region where the API request is processed.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-stream-sessions
          --channel-arn <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-arn (string)
          Channel ARN used to filter the list.

       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum number of streams to return. Default: 100.

       --next-token (string)
          The first stream to retrieve. This is used for pagination;  see  the
          nextToken response field.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To  get a summary of current and previous streams for a specified chan-
       nel in the current AWS region

       The following list-stream-sessions example reports summary  information
       for streams for a specified channel ARN (Amazon Resource Name).

          aws ivs list-stream-sessions \
              --channelArn arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh \
              --maxResults 25 \
              --nextToken ""

       Output:

          {
              "nextToken": "set-2",
              "streamSessions": [
                  {
                      "startTime": 1641578182,
                      "endTime": 1641579982,
                      "hasErrorEvent": false,
                      "streamId": "mystream"
                  }
                  ...
              ]
          }

       Video Service User Guide.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          If there are more streams than maxResults , use nextToken in the re-
          quest to get the next set.

       streamSessions -> (list)
          List of stream sessions.

          (structure)
              Summary information about a stream session.

              endTime -> (timestamp)
                 Time when the channel went offline. This is an ISO 8601 time-
                 stamp; note that this is returned as  a  string  .  For  live
                 streams, this is NULL .

              hasErrorEvent -> (boolean)
                 If true , this stream encountered a quota breach or failure.

              startTime -> (timestamp)
                 Time  when  the  channel went live. This is an ISO 8601 time-
                 stamp; note that this is returned as a string .

              streamId -> (string)
                 Unique identifier for a live or previously live stream in the
                 specified channel.
