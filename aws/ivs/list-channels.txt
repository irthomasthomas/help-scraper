LIST-CHANNELS()                                                LIST-CHANNELS()



NAME
       list-channels -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  summary  information  about  all channels in your account, in the
       Amazon Web Services region where the API  request  is  processed.  This
       list  can be filtered to match a specified name or recording-configura-
       tion ARN. Filters are mutually exclusive and cannot be  used  together.
       If  you try to use both filters, you will get an error (409 ConflictEx-
       ception).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-channels is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: channels

OPTIONS
       --filter-by-name (string)
          Filters the channel list to match the specified name.

       --filter-by-playback-restriction-policy-arn (string)
          Filters the channel list to match the specified policy.

       --filter-by-recording-configuration-arn (string)
          Filters the channel list to match the specified recording-configura-
          tion ARN.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       channels -> (list)
          List of the matching channels.

          (structure)
              Summary information about a channel.

              arn -> (string)
                 Channel ARN.

              authorized -> (boolean)
                 Whether the channel is private (enabled for  playback  autho-
                 rization). Default: false .

              insecureIngest -> (boolean)
                 Whether  the  channel  allows  insecure RTMP ingest. Default:
                 false .

              latencyMode -> (string)
                 Channel latency mode. Use NORMAL  to  broadcast  and  deliver
                 live video up to Full HD. Use LOW for near-real-time interac-
                 tion with viewers. Default: LOW .

              name -> (string)
                 Channel name.

              playbackRestrictionPolicyArn -> (string)
                 Playback-restriction-policy ARN. A valid ARN value here  both
                 specifies  the ARN and enables playback restriction. Default:
                 "" (empty string, no playback restriction policy is applied).

              preset -> (string)
                 Optional transcode preset for the channel. This is selectable
                 only for ADVANCED_HD and ADVANCED_SD channel types. For those
                 channel types, the default preset is  HIGHER_BANDWIDTH_DELIV-
                 ERY  .  For other channel types (BASIC and STANDARD ), preset
                 is the empty string ("" ).

              recordingConfigurationArn -> (string)
                 Recording-configuration ARN. A  valid  ARN  value  here  both
                 specifies  the  ARN and enables recording. Default: "" (empty
                 string, recording is disabled).

              tags -> (map)
                 Tags attached to the resource. Array of 1-50  maps,  each  of
                 the  form  string:string (key:value) . See Best practices and
                 strategies in Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources  and  Tag
                 Editor for details, including restrictions that apply to tags
                 and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS  has  no
                 service-specific constraints beyond what is documented there.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              type -> (string)
                 Channel  type,  which determines the allowable resolution and
                 bitrate. If you exceed the allowable input resolution or  bi-
                 trate,  the  stream probably will disconnect immediately. De-
                 fault: STANDARD . For details, see Channel Types .

       nextToken -> (string)
          If there are more channels than maxResults , use  nextToken  in  the
          request to get the next set.
