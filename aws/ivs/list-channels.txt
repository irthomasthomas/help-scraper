LIST-CHANNELS()                                                LIST-CHANNELS()



NAME
       list-channels -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  summary  information  about  all channels in your account, in the
       Amazon Web Services region where the API  request  is  processed.  This
       list  can be filtered to match a specified name or recording-configura-
       tion ARN. Filters are mutually exclusive and cannot be  used  together.
       If  you try to use both filters, you will get an error (409 ConflictEx-
       ception).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-channels is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: channels

OPTIONS
       --filter-by-name (string)
          Filters the channel list to match the specified name.

       --filter-by-recording-configuration-arn (string)
          Filters the channel list to match the specified recording-configura-
          tion ARN.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       channels -> (list)
          List of the matching channels.

          (structure)
              Summary information about a channel.

              arn -> (string)
                 Channel ARN.

              authorized -> (boolean)
                 Whether  the  channel is private (enabled for playback autho-
                 rization). Default: false .

              insecureIngest -> (boolean)
                 Whether the channel allows  insecure  RTMP  ingest.  Default:
                 false .

              latencyMode -> (string)
                 Channel  latency  mode.  Use  NORMAL to broadcast and deliver
                 live video up to Full HD. Use LOW for near-real-time interac-
                 tion  with  viewers.  Default: LOW . (Note: In the Amazon IVS
                 console, LOW and NORMAL correspond to Ultra-low and Standard,
                 respectively.)

              name -> (string)
                 Channel name.

              preset -> (string)
                 Optional transcode preset for the channel. This is selectable
                 only for ADVANCED_HD and ADVANCED_SD channel types. For those
                 channel  types, the default preset is HIGHER_BANDWIDTH_DELIV-
                 ERY . For other channel types (BASIC and STANDARD  ),  preset
                 is the empty string ("" ).

              recordingConfigurationArn -> (string)
                 Recording-configuration  ARN.  A  value  other  than an empty
                 string indicates  that  recording  is  enabled.  Default:  ""
                 (empty string, recording is disabled).

              tags -> (map)
                 Tags  attached  to  the resource. Array of 1-50 maps, each of
                 the form string:string (key:value) . See Tagging  Amazon  Web
                 Services  Resources  for more information, including restric-
                 tions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits and  require-
                 ments"; Amazon IVS has no service-specific constraints beyond
                 what is documented there.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              type -> (string)
                 Channel type, which determines the allowable  resolution  and
                 bitrate.  If you exceed the allowable input resolution or bi-
                 trate, the stream probably will disconnect immediately.  Some
                 types generate multiple qualities (renditions) from the orig-
                 inal input; this automatically gives viewers the best experi-
                 ence  for  their  devices  and network conditions. Some types
                 provide transcoded video; transcoding allows higher  playback
                 quality  across a range of download speeds. Default: STANDARD
                 . Valid values:

                 o BASIC : Video is transmuxed: Amazon IVS delivers the origi-
                   nal  input  quality  to  viewers. The viewers video-quality
                   choice is limited to the original input.  Input  resolution
                   can  be  up  to 1080p and bitrate can be up to 1.5 Mbps for
                   480p and up to 3.5 Mbps for resolutions  between  480p  and
                   1080p. Original audio is passed through.

                 o STANDARD : Video is transcoded: multiple qualities are gen-
                   erated from the original input, to automatically give view-
                   ers  the best experience for their devices and network con-
                   ditions. Transcoding allows higher playback quality  across
                   a  range  of download speeds. Resolution can be up to 1080p
                   and bitrate can be up to 8.5 Mbps. Audio is transcoded only
                   for  renditions 360p and below; above that, audio is passed
                   through. This is the default when you create a channel.

                 o ADVANCED_SD : Video is transcoded; multiple  qualities  are
                   generated  from  the  original input, to automatically give
                   viewers the best experience for their devices  and  network
                   conditions. Input resolution can be up to 1080p and bitrate
                   can be up to 8.5 Mbps;  output  is  capped  at  SD  quality
                   (480p).  You  can  select an optional transcode preset (see
                   below). Audio for all renditions is transcoded, and an  au-
                   dio-only rendition is available.

                 o ADVANCED_HD  :  Video is transcoded; multiple qualities are
                   generated from the original input,  to  automatically  give
                   viewers  the  best experience for their devices and network
                   conditions. Input resolution can be up to 1080p and bitrate
                   can  be  up  to  8.5  Mbps;  output is capped at HD quality
                   (720p). You can select an optional  transcode  preset  (see
                   below).  Audio for all renditions is transcoded, and an au-
                   dio-only rendition is available.

                 Optional transcode presets (available for the ADVANCED types)
                 allow you to trade off available download bandwidth and video
                 quality, to optimize the viewing experience.  There  are  two
                 presets:

                 o Constrained  bandwidth  delivery  uses  a lower bitrate for
                   each quality level. Use it if you have low  download  band-
                   width and/or simple video content (e.g., talking heads)

                 o Higher  bandwidth  delivery  uses a higher bitrate for each
                   quality level. Use it if you have high  download  bandwidth
                   and/or complex video content (e.g., flashes and quick scene
                   changes).

       nextToken -> (string)
          If there are more channels than maxResults , use  nextToken  in  the
          request to get the next set.
