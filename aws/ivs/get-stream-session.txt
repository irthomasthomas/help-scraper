GET-STREAM-SESSION()                                      GET-STREAM-SESSION()



NAME
       get-stream-session -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets metadata on a specified stream.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-stream-session
          --channel-arn <value>
          [--stream-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-arn (string)
          ARN of the channel resource

       --stream-id (string)
          Unique identifier for a live or previously live stream in the speci-
          fied channel. If no streamId is provided, this returns the most  re-
          cent stream session for the channel, if it exists.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get metadata for a specified stream

       The  following  get-stream-session example gets the metadata configura-
       tion for the specified channel ARN (Amazon Resource Name) and the spec-
       ified  stream;  if streamId is not provided, the most recent stream for
       the channel is selected.

              The properties of the channel at the time of going live.

              arn -> (string)
                 Channel ARN.

              authorized -> (boolean)
                 Whether  the  channel is private (enabled for playback autho-
                 rization). Default: false .

              ingestEndpoint -> (string)
                 Channel ingest endpoint, part of the definition of an  ingest
                 server, used when you set up streaming software.

              latencyMode -> (string)
                 Channel  latency  mode.  Use  NORMAL to broadcast and deliver
                 live video up to Full HD. Use LOW for near-real-time interac-
                 tion  with  viewers.  Default: LOW . (Note: In the Amazon IVS
                 console, LOW and NORMAL correspond to Ultra-low and Standard,
                 respectively.)

              name -> (string)
                 Channel name.

              playbackUrl -> (string)

              recordingConfigurationArn -> (string)
                 Recording-configuration  ARN.  A  value  other  than an empty
                 string indicates  that  recording  is  enabled.  Default:  ""
                 (empty string, recording is disabled).

              tags -> (map)
                 Array   of   1-50   maps,  each  of  the  form  string:string
                 (key:value) . See Tagging Amazon Web Services  Resources  for
                 more  information,  including restrictions that apply to tags
                 and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS  has  no
                 service-specific constraints beyond what is documented there.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              type -> (string)
                 Channel  type,  which determines the allowable resolution and
                 bitrate. If you exceed the allowable resolution  or  bitrate,
                 the  stream  probably  will  disconnect immediately. Default:
                 STANDARD . Valid values:

                 o STANDARD : Multiple qualities are generated from the origi-
                   nal  input,  to automatically give viewers the best experi-
                   ence for their devices and network  conditions.  Resolution
                   can be up to 1080p and bitrate can be up to 8.5 Mbps. Audio
                   is transcoded only for renditions  360p  and  below;  above
                   that, audio is passed through.

                 o BASIC  : Amazon IVS delivers the original input to viewers.
                   The viewers video-quality choice is limited to the original
                   input.  Resolution  can be up to 480p and bitrate can be up
                   to 1.5 Mbps.

          endTime -> (timestamp)
              Time when the channel went offline. This is an  ISO  8601  time-
              stamp;  note  that  this  is  returned  as  a  string . For live
              streams, this is NULL .

          ingestConfiguration -> (structure)
              The properties of the incoming RTMP stream for the stream.

              audio -> (structure)

              video -> (structure)
                 Encoder settings for video.

                 avcLevel -> (string)
                     Indicates  the degree of required decoder performance for
                     a profile. Normally this is set automatically by the  en-
                     coder. For details, see the H.264 specification.

                 avcProfile -> (string)
                     Indicates  to  the  decoder the requirements for decoding
                     the stream. For definitions of the valid values, see  the

                     bucketName -> (string)
                        Location  (S3  bucket name) where recorded videos will
                        be stored.

              name -> (string)
                 Recording-configuration name. The value does not need  to  be
                 unique.

              state -> (string)
                 Indicates  the  current state of the recording configuration.
                 When the state is ACTIVE , the  configuration  is  ready  for
                 recording a channel stream.

              tags -> (map)
                 Array   of   1-50   maps,  each  of  the  form  string:string
                 (key:value) . See Tagging Amazon Web Services  Resources  for
                 more  information,  including restrictions that apply to tags
                 and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS  has  no
                 service-specific constraints beyond what is documented there.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              thumbnailConfiguration -> (structure)
                 A  complex type that allows you to enable/disable the record-
                 ing of thumbnails for a live session and modify the  interval
                 at which thumbnails are generated for the live session.

                 recordingMode -> (string)
                     Thumbnail recording mode. Default: INTERVAL .

                 targetIntervalSeconds -> (long)
                     The  targeted  thumbnail-generation  interval in seconds.
                     This is configurable (and required) only if recordingMode
                     is INTERVAL . Default: 60.
                        Important:  Setting  a value for targetIntervalSeconds
                        does not guarantee that thumbnails  are  generated  at
                        the specified interval. For thumbnails to be generated
                        at    the    targetIntervalSeconds    interval,    the
                        IDR/Keyframe  value  for  the input video must be less
                        than the targetIntervalSeconds value. See  Amazon  IVS
                        Streaming  Configuration  for  information  on setting
                        IDR/Keyframe to the recommended value in video-encoder
                        settings.

          startTime -> (timestamp)
              Time  when the channel went live. This is an ISO 8601 timestamp;
              note that this is returned as a string .

          streamId -> (string)
              Unique identifier for a live or previously live  stream  in  the
              specified channel.

          truncatedEvents -> (list)
              List  of Amazon IVS events that the stream encountered. The list
              is sorted by most recent events and contains up to  500  events.
              For  Amazon IVS events, see Using Amazon EventBridge with Amazon
              IVS .

              (structure)
                 Object specifying a streams events. For a list of events, see
