OPTIONS
       --channel-arn (string)
          ARN of the channel resource

       --stream-id (string)
          Unique identifier for a live or previously live stream in the speci-
          fied channel. If no streamId is provided, this returns the most  re-
          cent stream session for the channel, if it exists.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get metadata for a specified stream

       The  following  get-stream-session example gets the metadata configura-
       tion for the specified channel ARN (Amazon Resource Name) and the spec-
       ified  stream;  if streamId is not provided, the most recent stream for
       the channel is selected.

              arn -> (string)
                 Channel ARN.

              authorized -> (boolean)
                 Whether  the  channel is private (enabled for playback autho-
                 rization). Default: false .

              ingestEndpoint -> (string)
                 Channel ingest endpoint, part of the definition of an  ingest

              insecureIngest -> (boolean)
                 Whether  the  channel  allows  insecure RTMP ingest. Default:
                 false .

              latencyMode -> (string)
                 Channel latency mode. Use NORMAL  to  broadcast  and  deliver
                 live video up to Full HD. Use LOW for near-real-time interac-
                 tion with viewers. Default: LOW . (Note: In  the  Amazon  IVS
                 console, LOW and NORMAL correspond to Ultra-low and Standard,
                 respectively.)

              name -> (string)
                 Channel name.

              playbackUrl -> (string)
                 Channel playback URL.

              preset -> (string)
                 Optional transcode preset for the channel. This is selectable
                 only for ADVANCED_HD and ADVANCED_SD channel types. For those
                 channel types, the default preset is  HIGHER_BANDWIDTH_DELIV-
                 ERY  .  For other channel types (BASIC and STANDARD ), preset
                 is the empty string ("" ).

              recordingConfigurationArn -> (string)
                 Recording-configuration ARN. A  value  other  than  an  empty
                 string  indicates  that  recording  is  enabled.  Default: ""
                 (empty string, recording is disabled).

              tags -> (map)
                 Tags attached to the resource. Array of 1-50  maps,  each  of
                 the  form  string:string (key:value) . See Tagging Amazon Web
                 Services Resources for more information,  including  restric-
                 tions  that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits and require-
                 ments"; Amazon IVS has no service-specific constraints beyond
                 what is documented there.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              type -> (string)
                 Channel  type,  which determines the allowable resolution and
                 bitrate. If you exceed the allowable input resolution or  bi-
                 trate,  the stream probably will disconnect immediately. Some
                 types generate multiple qualities (renditions) from the orig-
                 inal input; this automatically gives viewers the best experi-
                 ence for their devices and  network  conditions.  Some  types
                 provide  transcoded video; transcoding allows higher playback
                 quality across a range of download speeds. Default:  STANDARD
                 . Valid values:

                 o BASIC : Video is transmuxed: Amazon IVS delivers the origi-
                   nal input quality to  viewers.  The  viewers  video-quality
                   choice  is  limited to the original input. Input resolution
                   can be up to 1080p and bitrate can be up to  1.5  Mbps  for
                   480p  and  up  to 3.5 Mbps for resolutions between 480p and
                   1080p. Original audio is passed through.

                 o STANDARD : Video is transcoded: multiple qualities are gen-
                   erated from the original input, to automatically give view-
                   ers the best experience for their devices and network  con-
                   ditions.  Transcoding allows higher playback quality across
                   a range of download speeds. Resolution can be up  to  1080p
                   and bitrate can be up to 8.5 Mbps. Audio is transcoded only
                   for renditions 360p and below; above that, audio is  passed
                   through. This is the default when you create a channel.

                 o ADVANCED_SD  :  Video is transcoded; multiple qualities are
                   generated from the original input,  to  automatically  give
                   viewers  the  best experience for their devices and network
                   conditions. Input resolution can be up to 1080p and bitrate
                   can  be  up  to  8.5  Mbps;  output is capped at SD quality
                   (480p). You can select an optional  transcode  preset  (see
                   below).  Audio for all renditions is transcoded, and an au-
                   dio-only rendition is available.

                 o ADVANCED_HD : Video is transcoded; multiple  qualities  are
                   generated  from  the  original input, to automatically give
                   viewers the best experience for their devices  and  network
                   conditions. Input resolution can be up to 1080p and bitrate
                   can be up to 8.5 Mbps;  output  is  capped  at  HD  quality
                   (720p).  You  can  select an optional transcode preset (see
                   below). Audio for all renditions is transcoded, and an  au-
                   dio-only rendition is available.

                 Optional transcode presets (available for the ADVANCED types)
                 allow you to trade off available download bandwidth and video
                 quality,  to  optimize  the viewing experience. There are two
                 presets:

                 o Constrained bandwidth delivery uses  a  lower  bitrate  for
                   each  quality  level. Use it if you have low download band-
                   width and/or simple video content (e.g., talking heads)

                 o Higher bandwidth delivery uses a higher  bitrate  for  each
                   quality  level.  Use it if you have high download bandwidth
                   and/or complex video content (e.g., flashes and quick scene
                   changes).

          endTime -> (timestamp)
              Time  when  the  channel went offline. This is an ISO 8601 time-
              stamp; note that this  is  returned  as  a  string  .  For  live
              streams, this is NULL .

          ingestConfiguration -> (structure)
              The properties of the incoming RTMP stream for the stream.

              audio -> (structure)
                 Encoder settings for audio.

                 channels -> (long)
                     Number of audio channels.

                 codec -> (string)

                 sampleRate -> (long)
                     Number of audio samples recorded per second.

                 targetBitrate -> (long)
                     The  expected  ingest  bitrate (bits per second). This is
                     configured in the encoder.

              video -> (structure)
                 Encoder settings for video.

                 avcLevel -> (string)
                     Indicates the degree of required decoder performance  for
                     a  profile. Normally this is set automatically by the en-
                     coder. For details, see the H.264 specification.

                 avcProfile -> (string)
                     Indicates to the decoder the  requirements  for  decoding
                     the  stream. For definitions of the valid values, see the
                     H.264 specification.

                 codec -> (string)

                 targetFramerate -> (long)
                     The  expected ingest framerate. This is configured in the
                     encoder.

                 videoHeight -> (long)
                     Video-resolution height in pixels.

                        Location (S3 bucket name) where recorded  videos  will
                        be stored.

              name -> (string)
                 Recording-configuration  name.  The value does not need to be
                 unique.

              recordingReconnectWindowSeconds -> (integer)
                 If a broadcast disconnects and  then  reconnects  within  the
                 specified interval, the multiple streams will be considered a
                 single broadcast and merged together. Default: 0.

              renditionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Object that describes which renditions should be recorded for
                 a stream.

                 renditionSelection -> (string)
                     Indicates  which  set  of  renditions  are recorded for a
                     stream. For BASIC channels, the CUSTOM value has  no  ef-
                     fect. If CUSTOM is specified, a set of renditions must be
                     specified in the renditions field. Default: ALL .

                 renditions -> (list)
                     Indicates which renditions are recorded for a stream,  if
                     renditionSelection  is  CUSTOM ; otherwise, this field is
                     irrelevant. The selected renditions are recorded if  they
                     are  available during the stream. If a selected rendition
                     is unavailable, the best available rendition is recorded.
                     For  details  on the resolution dimensions of each rendi-
                     tion, see Auto-Record to Amazon S3 .

                     (string)

              state -> (string)
                 Indicates the current state of the  recording  configuration.
                 When  the  state  is  ACTIVE , the configuration is ready for
                 recording a channel stream.

              tags -> (map)
                 Tags attached to the resource. Array of 1-50  maps,  each  of
                 the  form  string:string (key:value) . See Tagging Amazon Web
                 Services Resources for more information,  including  restric-
                 tions  that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits and require-
                 ments"; Amazon IVS has no service-specific constraints beyond
                 what is documented there.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              thumbnailConfiguration -> (structure)
                 A  complex type that allows you to enable/disable the record-
                 ing of thumbnails for a live session and modify the  interval
                 at which thumbnails are generated for the live session.

                 recordingMode -> (string)
                     Thumbnail recording mode. Default: INTERVAL .

                 resolution -> (string)
                     Indicates  the desired resolution of recorded thumbnails.
                     Thumbnails are recorded at the selected resolution if the
                     corresponding  rendition  is available during the stream;
                     otherwise, they are recorded at  source  resolution.  For
                     more information about resolution values and their corre-
                     sponding height and width dimensions, see Auto-Record  to
                     Amazon  S3  .  Default:  Null  (source  resolution is re-
                     turned).

                 storage -> (list)
                     Indicates the format in which  thumbnails  are  recorded.
                     SEQUENTIAL  records  all generated thumbnails in a serial
                     manner, to the media/thumbnails directory.  LATEST  saves
                     the  latest thumbnail in media/latest_thumbnail/thumb.jpg
                     and overwrites it at the interval  specified  by  target-
                     IntervalSeconds . You can enable both SEQUENTIAL and LAT-
                     EST . Default: SEQUENTIAL .

                     (string)

                 targetIntervalSeconds -> (long)
                     The targeted thumbnail-generation  interval  in  seconds.
                     This is configurable (and required) only if recordingMode
                     is INTERVAL . Default: 60.
                        Important: For the BASIC channel type, setting a value
                        for  targetIntervalSeconds  does  not  guarantee  that
                        thumbnails are generated at  the  specified  interval.
                        For  thumbnails  to  be  generated at the targetInter-
                        valSeconds interval, the IDR/Keyframe  value  for  the
                        input  video  must be less than the targetIntervalSec-
                        onds value. See Amazon IVS Streaming Configuration for
                        information on setting IDR/Keyframe to the recommended
                        value in video-encoder settings.

          startTime -> (timestamp)
              Time when the channel went live. This is an ISO 8601  timestamp;
              note that this is returned as a string .

          streamId -> (string)
              Unique  identifier  for  a live or previously live stream in the
              specified channel.

          truncatedEvents -> (list)
              List of Amazon IVS events that the stream encountered. The  list
              is  sorted  by most recent events and contains up to 500 events.
              For Amazon IVS events, see Using Amazon EventBridge with  Amazon
              IVS .

              (structure)
                 Object specifying a streams events. For a list of events, see
                 Using Amazon EventBridge with Amazon IVS .

                 eventTime -> (timestamp)
                     Time when the event occurred. This is an ISO  8601  time-
                     stamp; note that this is returned as a string .

                 name -> (string)
                     Name that identifies the stream event within a type .

                 type -> (string)
                     Logical group for certain events.
