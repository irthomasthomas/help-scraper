SYNOPSIS
            get-recording-configuration
          --arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          ARN of the recording configuration to be retrieved.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about a RecordingConfiguration resource

       The  following  get-recording-configuration  example  gets  information
       about the RecordingConfiguration resource for the specified ARN.

          aws ivs get-recording-configuration \
              --arn "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:recording-configuration/ABcdef34ghIJ"

OUTPUT
       recordingConfiguration -> (structure)
          arn -> (string)
              Recording-configuration ARN.

          destinationConfiguration -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains information  about  where  recorded
              video will be stored.

              s3 -> (structure)
                 An S3 destination configuration where recorded videos will be
                 stored.

                 bucketName -> (string)
                     Location (S3 bucket name) where recorded videos  will  be
                     stored.

          name -> (string)
              Recording-configuration  name.  The  value  does  not need to be
              unique.

          recordingReconnectWindowSeconds -> (integer)
              If a broadcast disconnects and then reconnects within the speci-
              fied  interval, the multiple streams will be considered a single
              broadcast and merged together. Default: 0.

          renditionConfiguration -> (structure)
              Object that describes which renditions should be recorded for  a
              stream.

              renditionSelection -> (string)
                 Indicates  which set of renditions are recorded for a stream.
                 For BASIC channels, the CUSTOM value has no effect. If CUSTOM
                 is  specified,  a  set of renditions must be specified in the
                 renditions field. Default: ALL .

              renditions -> (list)
                 Indicates which renditions are recorded for a stream, if ren-
                 ditionSelection  is CUSTOM ; otherwise, this field is irrele-
                 vant. The selected renditions are recorded if they are avail-
                 able  during  the stream. If a selected rendition is unavail-
                 able, the best available rendition is recorded.  For  details
                 on   the   resolution   dimensions  of  each  rendition,  see
                 Auto-Record to Amazon S3 .

                 (string)

          state -> (string)
              Indicates the current state of the recording configuration. When
              the state is ACTIVE , the configuration is ready for recording a
              channel stream.

          tags -> (map)
              Tags attached to the resource. Array of 1-50 maps, each  of  the
              form  string:string (key:value) . See Best practices and strate-
              gies in Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources and Tag Editor for
              details, including restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag nam-
              ing limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS has no service-specific
              constraints beyond what is documented there.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          thumbnailConfiguration -> (structure)
              A  complex  type that allows you to enable/disable the recording
              of thumbnails for a live session  and  modify  the  interval  at
              which thumbnails are generated for the live session.

              recordingMode -> (string)
                 Thumbnail recording mode. Default: INTERVAL .

              resolution -> (string)
                 Indicates  the  desired  resolution  of  recorded thumbnails.
                 Thumbnails are recorded at the  selected  resolution  if  the
                 corresponding  rendition is available during the stream; oth-
                 erwise, they are recorded at source resolution. For more  in-
                 formation  about  resolution  values  and their corresponding
                 height and width dimensions, see Auto-Record to Amazon  S3  .
                 Default: Null (source resolution is returned).

              storage -> (list)
                 Indicates  the  format  in which thumbnails are recorded. SE-
                 QUENTIAL records all generated thumbnails in a serial manner,
                 to  the  media/thumbnails  directory. LATEST saves the latest
                 thumbnail in media/latest_thumbnail/thumb.jpg and  overwrites
                 it  at  the interval specified by targetIntervalSeconds . You
                 can enable both SEQUENTIAL and LATEST . Default: SEQUENTIAL .

                 (string)

              targetIntervalSeconds -> (long)
                 The targeted thumbnail-generation interval in  seconds.  This
                 is  configurable  (and required) only if recordingMode is IN-
                 TERVAL . Default: 60.
                     Important: For the BASIC channel type,  setting  a  value
                     for  targetIntervalSeconds does not guarantee that thumb-
                     nails are generated at the specified interval. For thumb-
                     nails to be generated at the targetIntervalSeconds inter-
                     val, the IDR/Keyframe value for the input video  must  be
                     less than the targetIntervalSeconds value. See Amazon IVS
                     Streaming  Configuration  for  information   on   setting
                     IDR/Keyframe  to  the  recommended value in video-encoder
                     settings.
