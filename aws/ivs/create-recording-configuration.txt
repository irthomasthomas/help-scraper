CREATE-RECORDING-CONFIGURATION()              CREATE-RECORDING-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       create-recording-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new recording configuration, used to enable recording to Ama-
       zon S3.
          Known issue: In the us-east-1 region, if you use the Amazon Web Ser-
          vices  CLI  to  create a recording configuration, it returns success
          even if the S3 bucket is in a different region. In  this  case,  the
          state  of  the  recording configuration is CREATE_FAILED (instead of
          ACTIVE ). (In other regions, the CLI correctly  returns  failure  if
          the bucket is in a different region.)

          Workaround:  Ensure that your S3 bucket is in the same region as the
          recording configuration. If you create a recording configuration  in
          a different region as your S3 bucket, delete that recording configu-
          ration and create a new one with an S3 bucket from the  correct  re-
          gion.

OPTIONS
       --destination-configuration (structure)
          A  complex  type that contains a destination configuration for where
          recorded video will be stored.

          s3 -> (structure)
              An S3 destination configuration where recorded  videos  will  be
              stored.

              bucketName -> (string)
                 Location  (S3  bucket  name)  where  recorded  videos will be
                 stored.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          s3={bucketName=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "s3": {
              "bucketName": "string"
            }
          }

       --name (string)
          Recording-configuration name. The value does not need to be unique.

       --recording-reconnect-window-seconds (integer)
          If a broadcast disconnects and then reconnects within the  specified
          interval, the multiple streams will be considered a single broadcast
          and merged together. Default: 0.

       --tags (map)
          Array of 1-50 maps, each of the form string:string (key:value) . See
          Tagging  Amazon Web Services Resources for more information, includ-
          ing restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits  and  re-
          quirements";  Amazon  IVS has no service-specific constraints beyond
          what is documented there.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --thumbnail-configuration (structure)
          A complex type that allows you to enable/disable  the  recording  of
          thumbnails  for  a  live  session  and  modify the interval at which
          thumbnails are generated for the live session.

          recordingMode -> (string)
              Thumbnail recording mode. Default: INTERVAL .

          targetIntervalSeconds -> (long)
              The targeted thumbnail-generation interval in seconds.  This  is
              configurable  (and required) only if recordingMode is INTERVAL .
              Default: 60.
                 Important: Setting a value for targetIntervalSeconds does not
                 guarantee  that thumbnails are generated at the specified in-
                 terval. For thumbnails to be generated  at  the  targetInter-
                 valSeconds  interval,  the  IDR/Keyframe  value for the input
                 video must be less than the targetIntervalSeconds value.  See
                 Amazon IVS Streaming Configuration for information on setting
                 IDR/Keyframe to the recommended value in  video-encoder  set-
                 tings.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          recordingMode=string,targetIntervalSeconds=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "recordingMode": "DISABLED"|"INTERVAL",
            "targetIntervalSeconds": long
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a RecordingConfiguration resource

       The  following create-recording-configuration example creates a Record-
       ingConfiguration resource to enable recording to Amazon S3.

          aws ivs create-recording-configuration \
              --name "test-recording-config" \
              --recording-reconnect-window-seconds 60 \
              --tags "key1=value1, key2=value2" \
              --destination-configuration s3={bucketName=demo-recording-bucket} \
              --thumbnail-configuration recordingMode="INTERVAL",targetIntervalSeconds=30

       Output:

          {
              "recordingConfiguration": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:recording-configuration/ABcdef34ghIJ",
                  "destinationConfiguration": {
                      "s3": {
                          "bucketName": "demo-recording-bucket"
                      }
                  },
                  "name": "test-recording-config",
                  "recordingReconnectWindowSeconds": 60,
                  "state": "CREATING",
                  "tags": { "key1" : "value1" },
                  "thumbnailConfiguration": {
                      "recordingMode": "INTERVAL",
                      "targetIntervalSeconds": 30
                  }
              }
          }

              Recording-configuration ARN.

          destinationConfiguration -> (structure)
              A  complex  type  that contains information about where recorded
              video will be stored.

              s3 -> (structure)
                 An S3 destination configuration where recorded videos will be
                 stored.

                 bucketName -> (string)
                     Location  (S3  bucket name) where recorded videos will be
                     stored.

          name -> (string)
              Recording-configuration name. The value  does  not  need  to  be
              unique.

          recordingReconnectWindowSeconds -> (integer)
              If a broadcast disconnects and then reconnects within the speci-
              fied interval, the multiple streams will be considered a  single
              broadcast and merged together. Default: 0.

          state -> (string)
              Indicates the current state of the recording configuration. When
              the state is ACTIVE , the configuration is ready for recording a
              channel stream.

          tags -> (map)
              Tags  attached  to the resource. Array of 1-50 maps, each of the
              form string:string (key:value) . See Tagging Amazon Web Services
              Resources  for more information, including restrictions that ap-
              ply to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS
              has  no  service-specific  constraints beyond what is documented
              there.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          thumbnailConfiguration -> (structure)
              A complex type that allows you to enable/disable  the  recording
              of  thumbnails  for  a  live  session and modify the interval at
              which thumbnails are generated for the live session.

              recordingMode -> (string)
                 Thumbnail recording mode. Default: INTERVAL .

              targetIntervalSeconds -> (long)
                 The targeted thumbnail-generation interval in  seconds.  This
                 is  configurable  (and required) only if recordingMode is IN-
                 TERVAL . Default: 60.
                     Important: Setting a value for targetIntervalSeconds does
                     not guarantee that thumbnails are generated at the speci-
                     fied interval. For thumbnails to be generated at the tar-
                     getIntervalSeconds  interval,  the IDR/Keyframe value for
                     the input video must be less than the  targetIntervalSec-
                     onds  value.  See  Amazon IVS Streaming Configuration for
                     information on setting IDR/Keyframe  to  the  recommended
                     value in video-encoder settings.
