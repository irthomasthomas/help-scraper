UPDATE-CHANNEL()                                              UPDATE-CHANNEL()



NAME
       update-channel -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates a channel's configuration. Live channels cannot be updated. You
       must stop the ongoing stream,  update  the  channel,  and  restart  the
       stream for the changes to take effect.

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          ARN of the channel to be updated.

       --authorized | --no-authorized (boolean)
          Whether the channel is private (enabled for playback authorization).

       --insecure-ingest | --no-insecure-ingest (boolean)
          Whether  the  channel  allows insecure RTMP and SRT ingest. Default:
          false .

       --latency-mode (string)
          Channel latency mode. Use NORMAL to broadcast and deliver live video
          up to Full HD. Use LOW for near-real-time interaction with viewers.

          Possible values:

          o NORMAL

          o LOW

       --name (string)
          Channel name.

       --playback-restriction-policy-arn (string)
          Playback-restriction-policy  ARN. A valid ARN value here both speci-
          fies the ARN and enables playback restriction. If this is set to  an
          empty string, playback restriction policy is disabled.

       --preset (string)
          Optional  transcode  preset for the channel. This is selectable only
          for ADVANCED_HD and ADVANCED_SD channel  types.  For  those  channel
          types,  the  default preset is HIGHER_BANDWIDTH_DELIVERY . For other
          channel types (BASIC and STANDARD ), preset is the empty string  (""
          ).

          Possible values:

          o HIGHER_BANDWIDTH_DELIVERY

          o CONSTRAINED_BANDWIDTH_DELIVERY

       --recording-configuration-arn (string)
          Recording-configuration  ARN.  A valid ARN value here both specifies
          the ARN and enables recording. If this is set to  an  empty  string,
          recording is disabled.

       --type (string)
          Channel type, which determines the allowable resolution and bitrate.
          If you exceed the allowable input resolution or bitrate, the  stream
          probably  will  disconnect  immediately. Default: STANDARD . For de-
          tails, see Channel Types .

          Possible values:

          o BASIC

          o STANDARD

          o ADVANCED_SD

          o ADVANCED_HD

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To update a channel's configuration information

       The following update-channel example updates the channel  configuration
       for  a  specified channel ARN to change the channel name. This does not
       affect an ongoing stream of this channel; you must stop and restart the
       stream for the changes to take effect.

              ply to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS
              has  no  service-specific  constraints beyond what is documented
