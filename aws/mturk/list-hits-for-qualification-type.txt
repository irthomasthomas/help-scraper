NAME
       list-hits-for-qualification-type -

DESCRIPTION
       The  ListHITsForQualificationType  operation  returns the HITs that use
       the given Qualification type for a Qualification requirement. The oper-
       ation  returns  HITs  of  any  status,  except  for HITs that have been
       deleted with the DeleteHIT operation or that have been auto-deleted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-hits-for-qualification-type is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: HITs

OPTIONS
       --qualification-type-id (string)
          The ID of the Qualification type to use when querying HITs.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If the previous response was incomplete (because there is more  data
          to  retrieve),  Amazon Mechanical Turk returns a pagination token in
          the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next
          set of results.

          The number of HITs on this page in the filtered results list, equiv-
          alent to the number of HITs being returned by this call.

       HITs -> (list)
          The list of HIT elements returned by the query.

          (structure)
              The HIT data structure represents a single  HIT,  including  all
              the  information  necessary  for a Worker to accept and complete
              the HIT.

              HITId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the HIT.

              HITTypeId -> (string)
                 The ID of the HIT type of this HIT

              HITGroupId -> (string)
                 The ID of the HIT Group of this HIT.

              HITLayoutId -> (string)
                 The ID of the HIT Layout of this HIT.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the HIT was created.

              Title -> (string)
                 The title of the HIT.

              Description -> (string)
                 A general description of the HIT.

              Question -> (string)
                 The data the Worker completing the HIT uses produce  the  re-
                 sults.  This is either either a QuestionForm, HTMLQuestion or
                 an ExternalQuestion data structure.

              Keywords -> (string)
                 One or more words or phrases that describe the HIT, separated
                 by  commas. Search terms similar to the keywords of a HIT are
                 more likely to have the HIT in the search results.

              HITStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the HIT and its assignments. Valid  Values  are
                 Assignable  |  Unassignable  |  Reviewable | Reviewing | Dis-
                 posed.

              MaxAssignments -> (integer)
                 The number of times the HIT can be accepted and completed be-
                 fore the HIT becomes unavailable.

              Reward -> (string)
                 A string representing a currency amount.

              AutoApprovalDelayInSeconds -> (long)
                 The  amount  of time, in seconds, after the Worker submits an
                 assignment for the HIT that the results are automatically ap-
                 proved  by Amazon Mechanical Turk. This is the amount of time
                 the Requester has to reject  an  assignment  submitted  by  a
                 Worker  before the assignment is auto-approved and the Worker
                 is paid.

              Expiration -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the HIT expires.

              AssignmentDurationInSeconds -> (long)
                 The length of time, in seconds, that a Worker has to complete
                 the HIT after accepting it.

              RequesterAnnotation -> (string)
                 An arbitrary data field the Requester who created the HIT can
                 use. This field is visible only to the creator of the HIT.

              QualificationRequirements -> (list)
                 Conditions that a Worker's Qualifications must meet in  order
                 to accept the HIT. A HIT can have between zero and ten Quali-
                 fication requirements. All requirements must be met in  order
                 for  a  Worker to accept the HIT. Additionally, other actions
                 can be restricted using  the  ActionsGuarded  field  on  each
                 QualificationRequirement structure.

                 (structure)
                     The  QualificationRequirement  data structure describes a
                     Qualification that a Worker must have before  the  Worker
                     is  allowed to accept a HIT. A requirement may optionally
                     state that a Worker must have the Qualification in  order
                     to preview the HIT, or see the HIT in search results.

                     QualificationTypeId -> (string)
                        The ID of the Qualification type for the requirement.

                     Comparator -> (string)
                        The  kind  of  comparison to make against a Qualifica-
                        tion's value. You can compare a Qualification's  value
                        to   an   IntegerValue  to  see  if  it  is  LessThan,
                        LessThanOrEqualTo, GreaterThan,  GreaterThanOrEqualTo,
                        EqualTo,  or NotEqualTo the IntegerValue. You can com-
                        pare it to a LocaleValue to see if it is  EqualTo,  or
                        NotEqualTo  the  LocaleValue.  You can check to see if
                        the value is In or NotIn a set of IntegerValue or  Lo-
                        caleValue  values. Lastly, a Qualification requirement
                        can also test if a Qualification Exists or  DoesNotEx-
                        ist in the user's profile, regardless of its value.

                     IntegerValues -> (list)
                        The  integer  value  to compare against the Qualifica-
                        tion's value. IntegerValue must not be present if Com-
                        parator  is  Exists  or DoesNotExist. IntegerValue can
                        only be used if the Qualification type has an  integer
                        value; it cannot be used with the Worker_Locale Quali-
                        ficationType ID. When performing a set  comparison  by
                        using  the  In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up
                        to 15 IntegerValue elements in a QualificationRequire-
                        ment data structure.

                        (integer)

                     LocaleValues -> (list)
                        The  locale  value  to  compare against the Qualifica-
                        tion's value. The local value must be a valid ISO 3166
                        country  code or supports ISO 3166-2 subdivisions. Lo-
                        caleValue can only be used with a Worker_Locale Quali-
                        ficationType ID. LocaleValue can only be used with the
                        EqualTo, NotEqualTo, In, and  NotIn  comparators.  You
                        must  only use a single LocaleValue element when using
                        the EqualTo or NotEqualTo comparators. When performing
                        a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn compara-
                        tor, you can use up to 30 LocaleValue  elements  in  a
                        QualificationRequirement data structure.

                        (structure)
                            The  Locale data structure represents a geographi-
                            cal region or location.

                            Country -> (string)
                               The country of the locale. Must be a valid  ISO
                               3166  country  code.  For  example, the code US
                               refers to the United States of America.

                            Subdivision -> (string)
                               The state or subdivision of the locale. A valid
                               ISO  3166-2  subdivision code. For example, the
                               code WA refers to the state of Washington.

                     RequiredToPreview -> (boolean)
                        DEPRECATED: Use the ActionsGuarded field  instead.  If
                        RequiredToPreview  is  true, the question data for the
                        HIT will not be shown when a Worker  whose  Qualifica-
                        tions  do  not  meet this requirement tries to preview
                        the HIT. That is, a Worker's Qualifications must  meet
                        all of the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is
                        true in order to preview the HIT. If  a  Worker  meets
                        all  of  the  requirements  where RequiredToPreview is
                        true (or if there are no such requirements), but  does
                        not  meet  all  of  the  requirements for the HIT, the
                        Worker will be allowed to preview the  HIT's  question
                        data,  but  will not be allowed to accept and complete
                        the HIT. The default is false. This should not be used
                        in combination with the ActionsGuarded field.

                     ActionsGuarded -> (string)
                        Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifi-
                        cations do not meet this QualificationRequirement from
                        taking  the  specified action. Valid arguments include
                        "Accept" (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but  can  pre-
                        view  the  HIT  and  see  it in their search results),
                        "PreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot  accept  or  preview
                        the HIT, but can see the HIT in their search results),
                        and "DiscoverPreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot  accept,
                        preview, or see the HIT in their search results). It's
                        possible for you to create a HIT with multiple  Quali-
                        ficationRequirements  (which can have different values
                        for the ActionGuarded attribute). In  this  case,  the
                        Worker  is  only  permitted  to perform an action when
                        they have met all  QualificationRequirements  guarding
                        the action. The actions in the order of least restric-
                        tive to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and Ac-
                        cept.  For  example,  if a Worker meets all Qualifica-
                        tionRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAc-
                        cept,  but  do  not meet all requirements that are set
                        with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to
                        Discover, i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but
                        will not be able to Preview or Accept the HIT. Action-
                        sGuarded  should  not  be used in combination with the
                        RequiredToPreview field.

              HITReviewStatus -> (string)
                 Indicates the review status of  the  HIT.  Valid  Values  are
                 NotReviewed  |  MarkedForReview  |  ReviewedAppropriate | Re-
                 viewedInappropriate.

              NumberOfAssignmentsPending -> (integer)
                 The number of assignments for this HIT that  are  being  pre-
                 viewed  or  have  been  accepted by Workers, but have not yet
                 been submitted, returned, or abandoned.

              NumberOfAssignmentsAvailable -> (integer)
                 The number of assignments for this HIT that are available for
                 Workers to accept.

              NumberOfAssignmentsCompleted -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  assignments  for this HIT that have been ap-
                 proved or rejected.
