NAME
       list-workers-with-qualification-type -

DESCRIPTION
       The ListWorkersWithQualificationType operation returns all of the Work-
       ers that have been associated with a given Qualification type.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-workers-with-qualification-type is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: Qualifications

OPTIONS
       --qualification-type-id (string)
          The ID of the Qualification type of the Qualifications to return.

       --status (string)
          The status of the Qualifications to return. Can be Granted | Revoked
          .

          Possible values:

          o Granted

          o Revoked

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If the previous response was incomplete (because there is more  data
          to  retrieve),  Amazon Mechanical Turk returns a pagination token in
          the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next
          set of results.

       NumResults -> (integer)
          The  number  of  Qualifications on this page in the filtered results
          list, equivalent to the number of Qualifications being  returned  by
          this call.

       Qualifications -> (list)
          The list of Qualification elements returned by this call.

          (structure)
              The  Qualification data structure represents a Qualification as-
              signed to a user, including the Qualification type and the value
              (score).

              QualificationTypeId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Qualification type for the Qualification.

              WorkerId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Worker who possesses the Qualification.

              GrantTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time  the  Qualification  was  granted to the
                 Worker. If the Worker's Qualification was revoked,  and  then
                 re-granted based on a new Qualification request, GrantTime is
                 the date and time of the last call  to  the  AcceptQualifica-
                 tionRequest operation.

              IntegerValue -> (integer)
                 The  value (score) of the Qualification, if the Qualification
                 has an integer value.

              LocaleValue -> (structure)
                 The Locale data structure represents a geographical region or
                 location.

                 Country -> (string)
                     The country of the locale. Must be a valid ISO 3166 coun-

                     to the state of Washington.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  status  of the Qualification. Valid values are Granted |
