NAME
       notify-workers -

DESCRIPTION
       The  NotifyWorkers operation sends an email to one or more Workers that
       you specify with the Worker ID. You can specify up to 100 Worker IDs to
       send  the  same  message with a single call to the NotifyWorkers opera-
       tion. The NotifyWorkers operation will send a notification email  to  a
       Worker  only  if you have previously approved or rejected work from the
       Worker.

OPTIONS
       --subject (string)
          The subject line of the email message to send. Can include up to 200
          characters.

       --message-text (string)
          The text of the email message to send. Can include up to 4,096 char-
          acters

       --worker-ids (list)
          A list of Worker IDs you wish to notify. You  can  notify  upto  100
          Workers at a time.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

OUTPUT
       NotifyWorkersFailureStatuses -> (list)
          When MTurk sends notifications to the list of  Workers,  it  returns
