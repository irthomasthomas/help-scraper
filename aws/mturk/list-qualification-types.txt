LIST-QUALIFICATION-TYPES()                          LIST-QUALIFICATION-TYPES()



NAME
       list-qualification-types -

DESCRIPTION
       The  ListQualificationTypes  operation  returns a list of Qualification
       types, filtered by an optional search term.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-qualification-types is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: QualificationTypes

OPTIONS
       --must-be-requestable | --no-must-be-requestable (boolean)
          Specifies  that  only  Qualification  types  that a user can request
          through the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, such  as  by  taking  a
          Qualification  test,  are  returned  as  results of the search. Some
          Qualification types, such as those  assigned  automatically  by  the
          system,  cannot be requested directly by users. If false, all Quali-
          fication types, including those managed by the system,  are  consid-
          ered. Valid values are True | False.

       --must-be-owned-by-caller | --no-must-be-owned-by-caller (boolean)
          Specifies  that  only Qualification types that the Requester created
          are returned. If false,  the  operation  returns  all  Qualification
          types.

       --types-query (string)
          A  text query against all of the searchable attributes of Qualifica-
          tion types.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NumResults -> (integer)
          The number of Qualification types on this page in the  filtered  re-
          sults  list,  equivalent  to  the number of types this operation re-
          turns.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the previous response was incomplete (because there is more  data
          to  retrieve),  Amazon Mechanical Turk returns a pagination token in
          the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next
          set of results.

       QualificationTypes -> (list)
          The list of QualificationType elements returned by the query.

          (structure)
              The  QualificationType data structure represents a Qualification
              type, a description of a property of a Worker  that  must  match
              the  requirements  of  a HIT for the Worker to be able to accept
              the HIT. The type also describes how a Worker can obtain a Qual-
              ification of that type, such as through a Qualification test.

              QualificationTypeId -> (string)
                 A  unique identifier for the Qualification type. A Qualifica-
                 tion type is given a Qualification type ID when you call  the
                 CreateQualificationType operation.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the Qualification type was created.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the Qualification type. The type name is used to
                 identify the type, and to find the type using a Qualification
                 type search.

              Description -> (string)
                 A long description for the Qualification type.

              Keywords -> (string)
                 One  or  more words or phrases that describe theQualification
                 type, separated by commas. The Keywords make the type  easier
                 to find using a search.

              QualificationTypeStatus -> (string)
                 The  status of the Qualification type. A Qualification type's
                 status determines if users can apply to receive a  Qualifica-
                 tion  of  this type, and if HITs can be created with require-
                 ments based on this type. Valid values are Active | Inactive.

              Test -> (string)
                 The questions for a Qualification test associated  with  this
                 Qualification  type that a user can take to obtain a Qualifi-
                 cation of this type. This parameter must be specified if  An-
                 swerKey  is  present. A Qualification type cannot have both a
                 specified Test parameter and an AutoGranted value of true.

              TestDurationInSeconds -> (long)
                 The amount of time, in seconds, given to a Worker to complete
                 the  Qualification  test,  beginning from the time the Worker
                 requests the Qualification.

              AnswerKey -> (string)
                 The answers to the Qualification test specified in  the  Test
                 parameter.

              RetryDelayInSeconds -> (long)
                 The  amount of time, in seconds, Workers must wait after tak-
                 ing the Qualification test before they  can  take  it  again.
                 Workers  can take a Qualification test multiple times if they
                 were not granted the Qualification from a  previous  attempt,
                 or if the test offers a gradient score and they want a better
                 score. If not specified, retries are disabled and Workers can
                 request a Qualification only once.

              IsRequestable -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  the Qualification type is one that a user
                 can request through the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, such
                 as  by  taking  a Qualification test. This value is False for
                 Qualifications assigned automatically by  the  system.  Valid
                 values are True | False.

              AutoGranted -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  that  requests  for  the  Qualification  type  are
                 granted immediately, without  prompting  the  Worker  with  a
                 Qualification test. Valid values are True | False.

              AutoGrantedValue -> (integer)
                 The  Qualification  integer  value  to  use for automatically
                 granted Qualifications, if AutoGranted is true. This is 1  by
                 default.
