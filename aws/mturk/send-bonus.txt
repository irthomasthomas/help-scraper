SEND-BONUS()                                                      SEND-BONUS()



NAME
       send-bonus -

DESCRIPTION
       The  SendBonus operation issues a payment of money from your account to
       a Worker. This payment happens separately from the reward  you  pay  to
       the  Worker when you approve the Worker's assignment. The SendBonus op-
       eration requires the Worker's ID and the assignment ID as parameters to
       initiate payment of the bonus. You must include a message that explains
       the reason for the bonus payment, as the Worker may  not  be  expecting
       the  payment. Amazon Mechanical Turk collects a fee for bonus payments,
       similar to the HIT listing fee. This operation fails  if  your  account
       does not have enough funds to pay for both the bonus and the fees.

OPTIONS
       --worker-id (string)
          The ID of the Worker being paid the bonus.

       --bonus-amount (string)
          The Bonus amount is a US Dollar amount specified using a string (for
          example, "5" represents $5.00 USD and  "101.42"  represents  $101.42
          USD). Do not include currency symbols or currency codes.

       --assignment-id (string)
          The ID of the assignment for which this bonus is paid.

       --reason (string)
          A message that explains the reason for the bonus payment. The Worker
          receiving the bonus can see this message.

       --unique-request-token (string)
          A unique identifier for this request, which allows you to retry  the
          call  on  error without granting multiple bonuses. This is useful in
          cases such as network timeouts where it is unclear  whether  or  not
          the call succeeded on the server. If the bonus already exists in the
          system from a previous call using the same UniqueRequestToken,  sub-
          sequent calls will return an error with a message containing the re-
          quest ID.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
