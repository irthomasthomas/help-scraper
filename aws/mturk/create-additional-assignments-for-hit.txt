CREATE-ADDITIONAL-ASSIGNMENTS-FOR-HIT()CREATE-ADDITIONAL-ASSIGNMENTS-FOR-HIT()



NAME
       create-additional-assignments-for-hit -

DESCRIPTION
       The  CreateAdditionalAssignmentsForHIT  operation increases the maximum
       number of assignments of an existing HIT.

       To extend the maximum number of assignments, specify the number of  ad-
       ditional assignments.

       NOTE:

          o HITs  created with fewer than 10 assignments cannot be extended to
            have 10 or more assignments. Attempting to add  assignments  in  a
            way  that  brings  the  total number of assignments for a HIT from
            fewer than 10 assignments to 10 or more assignments will result in
            an AWS.MechanicalTurk.InvalidMaximumAssignmentsIncrease exception.

          o HITs  that  were  created before July 22, 2015 cannot be extended.
            Attempting to extend HITs that were created before July  22,  2015
            will  result in an AWS.MechanicalTurk.HITTooOldForExtension excep-
            tion.

OPTIONS
       --hit-id (string)
          The ID of the HIT to extend.

       --number-of-additional-assignments (integer)
          The number of additional assignments to request for this HIT.

       --unique-request-token (string)
          A unique identifier for this request, which allows you to retry  the
          call on error without extending the HIT multiple times. This is use-
          ful in cases such as network timeouts where it is unclear whether or
          not  the call succeeded on the server. If the extend HIT already ex-
          ists in the  system  from  a  previous  call  using  the  same  Uni-
          queRequestToken  , subsequent calls will return an error with a mes-
          sage containing the request ID.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       None
