LIST-BONUS-PAYMENTS()                                    LIST-BONUS-PAYMENTS()



NAME
       list-bonus-payments -

DESCRIPTION
       The  ListBonusPayments  operation  retrieves the amounts of bonuses you
       have paid to Workers for a given HIT or assignment.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-bonus-payments is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: BonusPayments

OPTIONS
       --hit-id (string)
          The ID of the HIT associated with the bonus payments to retrieve. If
          not specified, all bonus payments for all assignments for the  given
          HIT are returned. Either the HITId parameter or the AssignmentId pa-
          rameter must be specified

       --assignment-id (string)
          The ID of the assignment associated with the bonus payments  to  re-
          trieve.  If  specified, only bonus payments for the given assignment
          are returned. Either the HITId parameter or the AssignmentId parame-
          ter must be specified

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NumResults -> (integer)
          The number of bonus payments on this page in  the  filtered  results
          list,  equivalent  to the number of bonus payments being returned by
          this call.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the previous response was incomplete (because there is more  data
          to  retrieve),  Amazon Mechanical Turk returns a pagination token in
          the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next
          set of results.

       BonusPayments -> (list)
          A  successful  request  to the ListBonusPayments operation returns a
          list of BonusPayment objects.

          (structure)

              WorkerId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Worker to whom the bonus was paid.

              BonusAmount -> (string)
                 A string representing a currency amount.

              AssignmentId -> (string)
                 The ID of the assignment associated with this bonus payment.

              Reason -> (string)
                 The Reason text given when the bonus was granted, if any.

              GrantTime -> (timestamp)
