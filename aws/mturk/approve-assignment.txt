APPROVE-ASSIGNMENT()                                      APPROVE-ASSIGNMENT()



NAME
       approve-assignment -

DESCRIPTION
       The ApproveAssignment operation approves the results of a completed as-
       signment.

       Approving an assignment initiates two  payments  from  the  Requester's
       Amazon.com account

       o The  Worker who submitted the results is paid the reward specified in
         the HIT.

       o Amazon Mechanical Turk fees are debited.

       If the Requester's account does not have adequate funds for these  pay-
       ments,  the call to ApproveAssignment returns an exception, and the ap-
       proval is not processed. You can include an optional  feedback  message
       with  the  approval,  which the Worker can see in the Status section of
       the web site.

       You can also call this operation for assignments that were previous re-
       jected  and  approve  them by explicitly overriding the previous rejec-
       tion. This only works  on  rejected  assignments  that  were  submitted
       within  the  previous  30 days and only if the assignment's related HIT
       has not been deleted.

OPTIONS
       --assignment-id (string)
          The ID of the assignment. The assignment must correspond  to  a  HIT
          created by the Requester.

       --requester-feedback (string)
          A  message  for  the  Worker, which the Worker can see in the Status
          section of the web site.

       --override-rejection | --no-override-rejection (boolean)
          A flag indicating that an assignment should be approved even  if  it
          was previously rejected. Defaults to False .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
