DELETE-HIT()                                                      DELETE-HIT()



NAME
       delete-hit -

DESCRIPTION
       The DeleteHIT operation is used to delete HIT that is no longer needed.
       Only the Requester who created the HIT can delete it.

       You can only dispose of HITs that are in the Reviewable state, with all
       of  their submitted assignments already either approved or rejected. If
       you call the DeleteHIT operation on a HIT that is not in the Reviewable
       state  (for  example, that has not expired, or still has active assign-
       ments), or on a HIT that is Reviewable but without all of its submitted
       assignments  already  approved  or rejected, the service will return an
       error.

       NOTE:

          o HITs are automatically disposed of after 120 days.

          o After you dispose of a HIT, you can no longer  approve  the  HIT's
            rejected assignments.

          o Disposed  HITs are not returned in results for the ListHITs opera-
            tion.

          o Disposing HITs can improve the performance of operations  such  as
            ListReviewableHITs and ListHITs.

OPTIONS
       --hit-id (string)
          The ID of the HIT to be deleted.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
