OPTIONS
       --qualification-type-id (string)
          The ID of the QualificationType.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       QualificationType -> (structure)
          The returned Qualification Type

          QualificationTypeId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the Qualification type. A  Qualification
              type  is given a Qualification type ID when you call the Create-
              QualificationType operation.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time the Qualification type was created.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the Qualification type. The type  name  is  used  to
              identify  the  type,  and to find the type using a Qualification
              type search.

          Description -> (string)
              A long description for the Qualification type.

          Keywords -> (string)
              One or more words  or  phrases  that  describe  theQualification
              type,  separated by commas. The Keywords make the type easier to
              find using a search.

          QualificationTypeStatus -> (string)
              The status of the Qualification  type.  A  Qualification  type's
              status  determines if users can apply to receive a Qualification
              of this type, and if HITs can be created with requirements based
              on this type. Valid values are Active | Inactive.

          Test -> (string)
              The  questions  for  a  Qualification  test associated with this
              Qualification type that a user can take to obtain  a  Qualifica-
              tion of this type. This parameter must be specified if AnswerKey
              is present. A Qualification type cannot have  both  a  specified
              Test parameter and an AutoGranted value of true.

          TestDurationInSeconds -> (long)
              The  amount  of  time, in seconds, given to a Worker to complete
              the Qualification test, beginning from the time the  Worker  re-
              quests the Qualification.

          AnswerKey -> (string)
              The  answers to the Qualification test specified in the Test pa-
              rameter.

          RetryDelayInSeconds -> (long)
              The amount of time, in seconds, Workers must wait  after  taking
              the  Qualification  test  before they can take it again. Workers
              can take a Qualification test multiple times if  they  were  not
              granted  the  Qualification  from  a previous attempt, or if the
              test offers a gradient score and they want a  better  score.  If
              not  specified,  retries  are disabled and Workers can request a
              Qualification only once.

          IsRequestable -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the Qualification type is one that a user  can
              request  through the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, such as by
              taking a Qualification test. This value is False for  Qualifica-
              tions  assigned  automatically  by  the system. Valid values are
              True | False.

          AutoGranted -> (boolean)
              Specifies that requests for the Qualification type  are  granted
              immediately,  without  prompting the Worker with a Qualification
              test. Valid values are True | False.

          AutoGrantedValue -> (integer)
              The Qualification integer value to use for automatically granted
              Qualifications, if AutoGranted is true. This is 1 by default.
