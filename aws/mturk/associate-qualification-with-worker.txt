NAME
       associate-qualification-with-worker -

DESCRIPTION
       The  AssociateQualificationWithWorker operation gives a Worker a Quali-
       fication. AssociateQualificationWithWorker does not  require  that  the
       Worker  submit  a Qualification request. It gives the Qualification di-
       rectly to the Worker.

       You can only assign a Qualification of a Qualification  type  that  you
       created (using the CreateQualificationType operation).

       NOTE:
          Note:  AssociateQualificationWithWorker  does not affect any pending
          Qualification requests for the Qualification by the Worker.  If  you
          assign a Qualification to a Worker, then later grant a Qualification
          request made by the Worker, the granting of the request  may  modify
          the  Qualification score. To resolve a pending Qualification request
          without affecting the Qualification the Worker already  has,  reject
          the request with the RejectQualificationRequest operation.

OPTIONS
       --qualification-type-id (string)
          The  ID of the Qualification type to use for the assigned Qualifica-
          tion.

       --worker-id (string)
          The ID of the Worker to whom the Qualification  is  being  assigned.
          Worker  IDs are included with submitted HIT assignments and Qualifi-
          cation requests.

       --integer-value (integer)
          The value of the Qualification to assign.

       --send-notification | --no-send-notification (boolean)
          Specifies whether to send a notification email message to the Worker
          saying that the qualification was assigned to the Worker. Note: this
          is true by default.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.
