SEND-TEST-EVENT-NOTIFICATION()                  SEND-TEST-EVENT-NOTIFICATION()



NAME
       send-test-event-notification -

DESCRIPTION
       The  SendTestEventNotification  operation causes Amazon Mechanical Turk
       to send a notification message as if a HIT event occurred, according to
       the  provided notification specification. This allows you to test noti-
       fications without setting up notifications for a real HIT type and try-
       ing  to  trigger  them using the website. When you call this operation,
       the service attempts to send the test notification immediately.

OPTIONS
       --notification (structure)
          The notification specification to test. This value is  identical  to
          the value you would provide to the UpdateNotificationSettings opera-
          tion when you establish the notification  specification  for  a  HIT
          type.

          Destination -> (string)
              The target for notification messages. The Destinations format is
              determined by the specified Transport:

              o When Transport is Email, the Destination  is  your  email  ad-
                dress.

              o When Transport is SQS, the Destination is your queue URL.

              o When  Transport  is  SNS,  the  Destination is the ARN of your
                topic.

          Transport -> (string)
              The method Amazon Mechanical Turk uses to send the notification.
              Valid Values: Email | SQS | SNS.

          Version -> (string)
              The  version  of  the  Notification  API  to use. Valid value is
              2006-05-05.

          EventTypes -> (list)
              The list of events that should cause notifications to  be  sent.
              Valid Values: AssignmentAccepted | AssignmentAbandoned | Assign-
              mentReturned | AssignmentSubmitted |  AssignmentRejected  |  As-
              signmentApproved  |  HITCreated  |  HITExtended  | HITDisposed |
              HITReviewable | HITExpired | Ping. The Ping event is only  valid
              for the SendTestEventNotification operation.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Destination=string,Transport=string,Version=string,EventTypes=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Destination": "string",
            "Transport": "Email"|"SQS"|"SNS",
            "Version": "string",
            "EventTypes": ["AssignmentAccepted"|"AssignmentAbandoned"|"AssignmentReturned"|"AssignmentSubmitted"|"AssignmentRejected"|"AssignmentApproved"|"HITCreated"|"HITExpired"|"HITReviewable"|"HITExtended"|"HITDisposed"|"Ping", ...]
          }

       --test-event-type (string)
          The  event  to simulate to test the notification specification. This
          event is included in the test message even if the notification spec-
          ification does not include the event type. The notification specifi-
          cation does not filter out the test event.

          Possible values:

          o AssignmentAccepted

          o AssignmentAbandoned

          o AssignmentReturned

          o AssignmentSubmitted

          o AssignmentRejected

          o AssignmentApproved

          o HITCreated

          o HITExpired

          o HITReviewable

          o HITExtended

          o HITDisposed

          o Ping

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
