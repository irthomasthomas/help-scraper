LIST-CLUSTER-OPERATIONS()                            LIST-CLUSTER-OPERATIONS()



NAME
       list-cluster-operations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of all the operations that have been performed on the
       specified MSK cluster.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-cluster-operations is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: ClusterOperationInfoList

          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the cluster.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                            TLS  means that client-broker communication is en-
                            abled with TLS only.

                            TLS_PLAINTEXT means that client-broker  communica-
                            tion is enabled for both TLS-encrypted, as well as
                            plaintext data.

                            is enabled in plaintext only.

                            The default value is TLS_PLAINTEXT.

                        InCluster -> (boolean)

                            cation among the broker nodes of  the  cluster  is
                            encrypted.  When  set  to false, the communication
                            happens in plaintext.

                        Type -> (string)

                            turned  off.  SERVICE_PROVIDED_EIPS indicates that
                            public access is turned on.

                 StorageMode -> (string)
                     This controls storage mode for supported storage tiers.

                        means the changes apply to  all  the  brokers  in  the
                        cluster.

                               data drive on each kafka broker node in MiB per
                               second.

                            TLS  means that client-broker communication is en-
                            abled with TLS only.

                            TLS_PLAINTEXT means that client-broker  communica-
                            tion is enabled for both TLS-encrypted, as well as

                            is enabled in plaintext only.

                            The default value is TLS_PLAINTEXT.

                            encrypted.  When  set  to false, the communication
                            happens in plaintext.

                            turned  off.  SERVICE_PROVIDED_EIPS indicates that
                            public access is turned on.
