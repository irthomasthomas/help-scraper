ADD-IP-ROUTES()                                                ADD-IP-ROUTES()



NAME
       add-ip-routes -

DESCRIPTION
       If the DNS server for your self-managed domain uses a publicly address-
       able IP address, you must add a CIDR address block to  correctly  route
       traffic  to  and  from  your  Microsoft  AD on Amazon Web Services. Ad-
       dIpRoutes adds this address block. You can also use AddIpRoutes to  fa-
       cilitate routing traffic that uses public IP ranges from your Microsoft
       AD on Amazon Web Services to a peer VPC.

       Before you call AddIpRoutes , ensure that all of the  required  permis-
       sions  have been explicitly granted through a policy. For details about
       what permissions are required to run  the  AddIpRoutes  operation,  see
       Directory  Service  API Permissions: Actions, Resources, and Conditions
       Reference .

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          Identifier (ID) of the directory to which to add the address block.

       --ip-routes (list)
          IP address blocks, using CIDR format, of the traffic to route.  This
          is  often  the  IP  address  block  of  the DNS server used for your
          self-managed domain.

          (structure)
              IP address block. This is often the address  block  of  the  DNS
              server used for your self-managed domain.

              CidrIp -> (string)
                 IP  address block using CIDR format, for example 10.0.0.0/24.
                 This is often the address block of the DNS  server  used  for
                 your  self-managed domain. For a single IP address use a CIDR
                 address block with /32. For example 10.0.0.0/32.

              Description -> (string)
                 Description of the address block.

       Shorthand Syntax:

            }

          These security rules impact an internal network  interface  that  is
          not exposed publicly.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
