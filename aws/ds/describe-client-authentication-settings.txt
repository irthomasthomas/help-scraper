NAME
       describe-client-authentication-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about the type of client authentication for the
       specified directory, if the type is specified. If no type is specified,
       information  about  all  client authentication types that are supported
       for the specified directory is retrieved. Currently, only SmartCard  is
       supported.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-client-authentication-settings  is a paginated operation. Mul-
       tiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data  set
       of  results.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ClientAuthenticationSettingsInfo

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The identifier of the directory for which to retrieve information.

       --type (string)
          The type of client authentication for which to retrieve information.
          If  no  type is specified, a list of all client authentication types
          that are supported for the specified directory is retrieved.

          Possible values:

          o SmartCard

          o SmartCardOrPassword

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ClientAuthenticationSettingsInfo -> (list)
          Information  about  the type of client authentication for the speci-
          fied directory. The following information is retrieved: The date and
          time  when the status of the client authentication type was last up-
          dated, whether the client authentication type  is  enabled  or  dis-
          abled, and the type of client authentication.

          (structure)

              directory.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of client authentication for  the  specified  direc-
                 tory. If no type is specified, a list of all client authenti-
                 cation types that are supported  for  the  directory  is  re-
                 trieved.

              Status -> (string)
                 Whether the client authentication type is enabled or disabled
                 for the specified directory.

                 The date and time when the status of the  client  authentica-
                 tion type was last updated.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  next  token used to retrieve the client authentication settings
          if the number of setting types exceeds page limit and there  is  an-
          other page.
