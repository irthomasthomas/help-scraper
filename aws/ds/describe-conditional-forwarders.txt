OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The directory ID for which to get the list of associated conditional
          forwarders.

       --remote-domain-names (list)
          The  fully  qualified  domain names (FQDN) of the remote domains for
          which to get the list of associated conditional forwarders. If  this
          member is null, all conditional forwarders are returned.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ConditionalForwarders -> (list)
          The list of conditional forwarders that have been created.

          (structure)
              Points  to a remote domain with which you are setting up a trust
              relationship. Conditional forwarders are required  in  order  to
              set up a trust relationship with another domain.

              RemoteDomainName -> (string)
                 The  fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the remote domains
                 pointed to by the conditional forwarder.

              DnsIpAddrs -> (list)
                 The IP addresses of the remote DNS server associated with Re-
                 moteDomainName. This is the IP address of the DNS server that
                 your conditional forwarder points to.

                 (string)

              ReplicationScope -> (string)
                 The replication scope of the conditional forwarder. The  only
                 allowed  value  is  Domain  , which will replicate the condi-
                 tional forwarder to all of the domain  controllers  for  your
                 Amazon Web Services directory.
