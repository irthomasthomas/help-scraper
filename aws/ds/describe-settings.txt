OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The identifier of the directory for which to retrieve information.

       --status (string)
          The status of the directory settings for which to retrieve  informa-
          tion.

          Possible values:

          o Requested

          o Updating

          o Updated

          o Failed

          o Default

       --next-token (string)
          The  DescribeSettingsResult.NextToken  value from a previous call to
          DescribeSettings . Pass null if this is the first call.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       DirectoryId -> (string)
          The identifier of the directory.

       SettingEntries -> (list)
          The list of  SettingEntry objects that were retrieved.

          It is possible that this list contains less than the number of items
          specified  in  the Limit member of the request. This occurs if there
          are less than the requested number of items left to retrieve, or  if
          the limitations of the operation have been exceeded.

          (structure)
              Contains  information  about  the specified configurable setting
              for a directory.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type, or category, of a directory setting.  Similar  set-
                 tings have the same type. For example, Protocol , Cipher , or
                 Certificate-Based Authentication .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the directory setting. For example:
                     TLS_1_0

              AllowedValues -> (string)
                 The valid range of values for the  directory  setting.  These
                 values depend on the DataType of your directory.

              AppliedValue -> (string)
                 The value of the directory setting that is applied to the di-
                 rectory.

              RequestedValue -> (string)
                 The value that was last requested for the directory setting.

              RequestStatus -> (string)
                 The overall status of the request  to  update  the  directory
                 setting request. If the directory setting is deployed in more
                 than one region, and the request fails  in  any  region,  the
                 overall status is Failed .

              RequestDetailedStatus -> (map)
                 Details  about the status of the request to update the direc-
                 tory setting. If the directory setting is  deployed  in  more
                 than  one  region, status is returned for the request in each
                 region where the setting is deployed.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              RequestStatusMessage -> (string)
                 The last status message for the directory status request.

              LastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the directory  setting  was  last  up-
                 dated.

              LastRequestedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the request to update a directory set-
                 ting was last submitted.

              DataType -> (string)
                 The data type of a directory setting. This is used to  define
                 the  AllowedValues  of a setting. For example a data type can
                 be Boolean , DurationInSeconds , or Enum .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If not null, token that indicates that more results  are  available.
          Pass  this value for the NextToken parameter in a subsequent call to
          DescribeSettings to retrieve the next set of items.
