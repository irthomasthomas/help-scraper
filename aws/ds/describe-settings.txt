       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-settings
          --directory-id <value>
          [--status <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The identifier of the directory for which to retrieve information.

       --status (string)
          The status of the directory settings for which to retrieve  informa-
          tion.

          Possible values:

          o Requested

          o Updating

          o Updated

          o Failed

          o Default

       --next-token (string)
          The  DescribeSettingsResult.NextToken  value from a previous call to
          DescribeSettings . Pass null if this is the first call.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DirectoryId -> (string)
          The identifier of the directory.

       SettingEntries -> (list)

          It is possible that this list contains less than the number of items
          specified in the Limit member of the request. This occurs  if  there
          are  less than the requested number of items left to retrieve, or if
          the limitations of the operation have been exceeded.

          (structure)

                 The  overall  status  of  the request to update the directory
                 setting request. If the directory setting is deployed in more
                 than  one  region,  and  the request fails in any region, the

              RequestDetailedStatus -> (map)
                 Details about the status of the request to update the  direc-
