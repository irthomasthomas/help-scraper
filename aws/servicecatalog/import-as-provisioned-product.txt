IMPORT-AS-PROVISIONED-PRODUCT()                IMPORT-AS-PROVISIONED-PRODUCT()



NAME
       import-as-provisioned-product -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests  the  import  of  a resource as an Service Catalog provisioned
       product that is associated to an Service Catalog product and provision-
       ing  artifact.  Once imported, all supported Service Catalog governance
       actions are supported on the provisioned product.

       Resource import only supports CloudFormation stack ARNs. CloudFormation
       StackSets and non-root nested stacks are not supported.

       The  CloudFormation stack must have one of the following statuses to be
       imported: CREATE_COMPLETE , UPDATE_COMPLETE ,  UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE
       , IMPORT_COMPLETE , IMPORT_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE .

       Import  of the resource requires that the CloudFormation stack template
       matches the associated Service Catalog product provisioning artifact.

       The user or role that performs this operation must have the cloudforma-
       tion:GetTemplate  and  cloudformation:DescribeStacks IAM policy permis-
       sions.

OPTIONS
       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o en - English (default)

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --product-id (string)
          The product identifier.

       --provisioning-artifact-id (string)
          The identifier of the provisioning artifact.

       --provisioned-product-name (string)
          The user-friendly name of the provisioned product. The value must be
          unique  for  the Amazon Web Services account. The name cannot be up-
          dated after the product is provisioned.

       --physical-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the resource to be imported. It  only  cur-
          rently supports CloudFormation stack IDs.

       --idempotency-token (string)
          A  unique identifier that you provide to ensure idempotency. If mul-
          tiple requests differ only by the idempotency token,  the  same  re-
          sponse is returned for each repeated request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
