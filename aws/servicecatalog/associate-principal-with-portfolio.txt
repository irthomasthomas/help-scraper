NAME
       associate-principal-with-portfolio -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates the specified principal ARN with the specified portfolio.

       If  you  share  the  portfolio with principal name sharing enabled, the
       PrincipalARN association is included in the share.

       The PortfolioID , PrincipalARN , and PrincipalType parameters  are  re-
       quired.

       You  can  associate  a  maximum of 10 Principals with a portfolio using
       PrincipalType as IAM_PATTERN .

       NOTE:
          When you associate a principal with portfolio, a potential privilege
          escalation  path  may  occur when that portfolio is then shared with
          other accounts. For a user in a recipient account who is not an Ser-
          vice  Catalog  Admin, but still has the ability to create Principals
          (Users/Groups/Roles), that user could create a role that  matches  a
          principal name association for the portfolio. Although this user may
          not know which principal names are associated through Service  Cata-
          log,  they  may be able to guess the user. If this potential escala-
          tion path is a concern, then Service Catalog recommends using  Prin-
          cipalType  as  IAM  . With this configuration, the PrincipalARN must
          already exist in the recipient account before it can be associated.

OPTIONS
       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --portfolio-id (string)
          The portfolio identifier.

       --principal-arn (string)
          The ARN of the principal (user, role, or group). If  the  Principal-
          Type  is IAM , the supported value is a fully defined IAM Amazon Re-
          source Name (ARN) . If the PrincipalType is IAM_PATTERN ,  the  sup-
          ported  value  is  an  IAM ARN without an AccountID in the following
          format:
              arn:partition:iam:::resource-type/resource-id

          The ARN resource-id can be either:

          o A fully formed resource-id.  For  example,  arn:aws:iam:::role/re-
            source-name or arn:aws:iam:::role/resource-path/resource-name

          o A wildcard ARN. The wildcard ARN accepts IAM_PATTERN values with a
            "*" or "?" in the resource-id segment  of  the  ARN.  For  example
            arn:partition:service:::resource-type/resource-path/resource-name
            . The new symbols are  exclusive  to  the  resource-path  and  re-
            source-name and cannot replace the resource-type or other ARN val-
            ues.  The ARN path and principal  name  allow  unlimited  wildcard
            characters.

          Examples of an acceptable wildcard ARN:

          o arn:aws:iam:::role/ResourceName_*

          o arn:aws:iam:::role/
            *
            /
            ResourceName_
            ?

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 134)
            Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

          Examples of an unacceptable wildcard ARN:

          o arn:aws:iam:::
            *
            /ResourceName

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 144)
            Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

          You  can associate multiple IAM_PATTERN s even if the account has no
          principal with that name.

          The "?" wildcard character matches zero or  one  of  any  character.
          This  is  similar to ".?" in regular regex context. The "*" wildcard
          character matches any number of any characters. This is  similar  to
          ".*" in regular regex context.

          In   the   IAM   Principal   ARN   format   (arn:partition:iam:::re-
          source-type/resource-path/resource-name ), valid resource-type  val-
          ues  include  user/ , group/ , or role/ . The "?" and "*" characters
          are allowed only after the resource-type in the resource-id segment.
          You can use special characters anywhere within the resource-id.

          The  "*" character also matches the "/" character, allowing paths to
          be    formed    within     the     resource-id.     For     example,
          arn:aws:iam:::role/**** /
          ResourceName_
          ?*  matches  both  arn:aws:iam:::role/pathA/pathB/ResourceName_1 and
          arn:aws:iam:::role/pathA/ResourceName_1 .

       --principal-type (string)
          The principal type. The supported value is IAM if you  use  a  fully
          defined Amazon Resource Name (ARN), or IAM_PATTERN if you use an ARN
          with no accountID , with or without wildcard characters.

          Possible values:

          o IAM

          o IAM_PATTERN

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To associate a principal with a portfolio

       The following associate-principal-with-portfolio example  associates  a
       user with the specified portfolio.

              --portfolio-id port-2s6abcdefwdh4 \
              --principal-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/usertest \
              --principal-type IAM

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
