NAME
       associate-principal-with-portfolio -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates the specified principal ARN with the specified portfolio.

       If  you  share  the  portfolio with principal name sharing enabled, the
       PrincipalARN association is included in the share.

       The PortfolioID , PrincipalARN , and PrincipalType parameters  are  re-
       quired.

       You  can  associate  a  maximum of 10 Principals with a portfolio using
       PrincipalType as IAM_PATTERN

       NOTE:
          When you associate a principal with portfolio, a potential privilege
          escalation  path  may  occur when that portfolio is then shared with
          other accounts. For a user in a recipient account who is not an Ser-
          vice  Catalog  Admin, but still has the ability to create Principals
          (Users/Groups/Roles), that user could create a role that  matches  a
          principal name association for the portfolio. Although this user may
          not know which principal names are associated through Service  Cata-
          log,  they  may be able to guess the user. If this potential escala-
          tion path is a concern, then Service Catalog recommends using  Prin-
          cipalType  as  IAM  . With this configuration, the PrincipalARN must
          already exist in the recipient account before it can be associated.

OPTIONS
       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o en - English (default)

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --portfolio-id (string)
          The portfolio identifier.

       --principal-arn (string)
          The ARN of the principal (IAM user, role, or group). This field  al-
          lows an ARN with no accountID if PrincipalType is IAM_PATTERN .

          You  can  associate multiple IAM patterns even if the account has no
          principal with that name. This is useful in Principal  Name  Sharing
          if  you want to share a principal without creating it in the account
          that owns the portfolio.

       --principal-type (string)
          The principal type. The supported value is IAM if you  use  a  fully
          defined ARN, or IAM_PATTERN if you use an ARN with no accountID .

          Possible values:

          o IAM

          o IAM_PATTERN

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To associate a principal with a portfolio

       The  following  associate-principal-with-portfolio example associates a
       user with the specified portfolio.

              --portfolio-id port-2s6abcdefwdh4 \
              --principal-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/usertest \
              --principal-type IAM

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
