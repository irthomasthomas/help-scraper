SYNOPSIS
            list-portfolio-access
          [--accept-language <value>]
          --portfolio-id <value>
          [--organization-parent-id <value>]
          [--page-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o en - English (default)

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --portfolio-id (string)
          The portfolio identifier.

       --organization-parent-id (string)
          The  ID  of  an  organization node the portfolio is shared with. All
          children of this node with an inherited portfolio share will be  re-
          turned.

       --page-token (string)
          The  page  token  for the next set of results. To retrieve the first
          set of results, use null.

       --page-size (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return with this call.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
