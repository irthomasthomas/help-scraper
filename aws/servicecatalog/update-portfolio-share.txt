UPDATE-PORTFOLIO-SHARE()                              UPDATE-PORTFOLIO-SHARE()



NAME
       update-portfolio-share -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  specified portfolio share. You can use this API to enable
       or disable TagOptions sharing or  Principal  sharing  for  an  existing
       portfolio share.

       The portfolio share cannot be updated if the CreatePortfolioShare oper-
       ation is IN_PROGRESS , as the share is not available to recipient enti-
       ties.  In  this  case, you must wait for the portfolio share to be COM-
       PLETED.

       You must provide the accountId or organization node in the  input,  but
       not both.

       If the portfolio is shared to both an external account and an organiza-
       tion node, and both shares need to be  updated,  you  must  invoke  Up-
       datePortfolioShare separately for each share type.

       This  API cannot be used for removing the portfolio share. You must use
       DeletePortfolioShare API for that action.

       NOTE:
          When you associate a principal with portfolio, a potential privilege
          escalation  path  may  occur when that portfolio is then shared with
          other accounts. For a user in a recipient account who is not an Ser-
          vice  Catalog  Admin, but still has the ability to create Principals
          (Users/Groups/Roles), that user could create a role that  matches  a
          principal name association for the portfolio. Although this user may
          not know which principal names are associated through Service  Cata-
          log,  they  may be able to guess the user. If this potential escala-
          tion path is a concern, then Service Catalog recommends using  Prin-
          cipalType  as  IAM  . With this configuration, the PrincipalARN must
          already exist in the recipient account before it can be associated.

            "Value": "string"
          }

       --share-tag-options | --no-share-tag-options (boolean)
          Enables  or  disables TagOptions sharing for the portfolio share. If
          this field is not provided, the current state of TagOptions  sharing
          on the portfolio share will not be modified.

       --share-principals | --no-share-principals (boolean)
          A  flag  to enables or disables Principals sharing in the portfolio.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-

       the string will be taken literally.

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
