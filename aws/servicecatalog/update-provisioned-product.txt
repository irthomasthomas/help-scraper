       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,UsePreviousValue=boolean ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "UsePreviousValue": true|false
            }
            ...
          ]

       --provisioning-preferences (structure)
          An object that contains information about the  provisioning  prefer-
          ences for a stack set.

          StackSetAccounts -> (list)
              One  or  more Amazon Web Services accounts that will have access
              to the provisioned product.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              The Amazon Web Services accounts specified should be within  the
              list  of accounts in the STACKSET constraint. To get the list of
              accounts in the STACKSET constraint, use the  DescribeProvision-
              ingParameters operation.

              If  no  values  are specified, the default value is all accounts
              from the STACKSET constraint.

              (string)

          StackSetRegions -> (list)
              One or more Amazon Web Services Regions  where  the  provisioned
              product will be available.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              The  specified Regions should be within the list of Regions from
              the STACKSET constraint. To get  the  list  of  Regions  in  the
              STACKSET  constraint, use the DescribeProvisioningParameters op-
              eration.

              If no values are specified, the default  value  is  all  Regions
              from the STACKSET constraint.

              (string)

          StackSetFailureToleranceCount -> (integer)
              The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can
              fail before Service Catalog stops the operation in that  Region.
              If the operation is stopped in a Region, Service Catalog doesn't
              attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              Conditional: You must specify  either  StackSetFailureTolerance-
              Count or StackSetFailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

              The default value is 0 if no value is specified.

          StackSetFailureTolerancePercentage -> (integer)
              The percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this stack op-
              eration can fail before Service Catalog stops the  operation  in
              that  Region.  If  the operation is stopped in a Region, Service
              Catalog doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              When calculating the number of accounts based on  the  specified
              percentage,  Service  Catalog rounds down to the next whole num-
              ber.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              Conditional: You must specify  either  StackSetFailureTolerance-
              Count or StackSetFailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

          StackSetMaxConcurrencyCount -> (integer)
              The  maximum  number of accounts in which to perform this opera-
              tion at one time. This is dependent on the  value  of  StackSet-
              FailureToleranceCount  .  StackSetMaxConcurrentCount  is at most
              one more than the StackSetFailureToleranceCount .

              Note that this setting lets you specify the maximum  for  opera-
              tions.  For  large  deployments, under certain circumstances the
              actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may  be  lower
              due to service throttling.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              Conditional:  You must specify either StackSetMaxConcurrentCount
              or StackSetMaxConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

          StackSetMaxConcurrencyPercentage -> (integer)
              The maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this  op-
              eration at one time.

              When  calculating  the number of accounts based on the specified
              percentage, Service Catalog rounds down to the next  whole  num-
              ber.  This is true except in cases where rounding down would re-
              sult is zero. In this case, Service Catalog sets the number as 1
              instead.

              Note  that  this setting lets you specify the maximum for opera-
              tions. For large deployments, under  certain  circumstances  the
              actual  number  of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower
              due to service throttling.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              Conditional: You must specify either  StackSetMaxConcurrentCount
              or StackSetMaxConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

          StackSetOperationType -> (string)
              Determines  what  action Service Catalog performs to a stack set
              or a stack instance represented by the provisioned product.  The
              default value is UPDATE if nothing is specified.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.
                 CREATE

              Creates a new stack instance in the stack set represented by the
              provisioned product. In this case, only new stack instances  are
              created  based on accounts and Regions; if new ProductId or Pro-
              visioningArtifactID are passed, they will be ignored.
                 UPDATE

              Updates the stack set represented by the provisioned product and
              also its stack instances.
                 DELETE

              Deletes  a  stack  instance  in the stack set represented by the
              provisioned product.

       --tags (list)
          One or more tags. Requires the product to have RESOURCE_UPDATE  con-
          straint  with TagUpdatesOnProvisionedProduct set to ALLOWED to allow
          tag updates.

          (structure)
              Information about a tag. A tag is a  key-value  pair.  Tags  are
              propagated to the resources created when provisioning a product.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for this key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

       --update-token (string)
          The  idempotency token that uniquely identifies the provisioning up-
          date request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
