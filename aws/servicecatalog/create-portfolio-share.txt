CREATE-PORTFOLIO-SHARE()                              CREATE-PORTFOLIO-SHARE()



NAME
       create-portfolio-share -

DESCRIPTION
       Shares  the specified portfolio with the specified account or organiza-
       tion node. Shares to an organization node can only be  created  by  the
       management  account of an organization or by a delegated administrator.
       You can share portfolios to an organization, an organizational unit, or
       a specific account.

       Note  that  if  a  delegated admin is de-registered, they can no longer
       create portfolio shares.
          AWSOrganizationsAccess must be enabled in order to create a  portfo-
          lio share to an organization node.

       You  can't share a shared resource, including portfolios that contain a
       shared product.

       If the portfolio share with the specified account or organization  node
       already  exists, this action will have no effect and will not return an
       error. To update an existing share,  you  must  use  the  UpdatePortfo-
       lioShare API instead.

       NOTE:
          When you associate a principal with portfolio, a potential privilege
          escalation path may occur when that portfolio is  then  shared  with
          other accounts. For a user in a recipient account who is not an Ser-
          vice Catalog Admin, but still has the ability to  create  Principals
          (Users/Groups/Roles),  that  user could create a role that matches a
          principal name association for the portfolio. Although this user may
          not  know which principal names are associated through Service Cata-
          log, they may be able to guess the user. If this  potential  escala-
          tion  path is a concern, then Service Catalog recommends using Prin-
          cipalType as IAM . With this configuration,  the  PrincipalARN  must
          already exist in the recipient account before it can be associated.

OPTIONS
       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --portfolio-id (string)
          The portfolio identifier.

       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID. For example, 123456789012 .

       --organization-node (structure)
          The  organization node to whom you are going to share. When you pass
          OrganizationNode , it creates PortfolioShare for all of  the  Amazon
          Web  Services accounts that are associated to the OrganizationNode .
          The output returns a PortfolioShareToken , which enables the  admin-
          istrator  to  monitor  the  status  of  the  PortfolioShare creation
          process.

          Type -> (string)
              The organization node type.

          Value -> (string)
              The identifier of the organization node.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Value=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Type": "ORGANIZATION"|"ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT"|"ACCOUNT",
            "Value": "string"
          }

       --share-tag-options | --no-share-tag-options (boolean)
          Enables or disables TagOptions sharing when creating  the  portfolio
          share. If this flag is not provided, TagOptions sharing is disabled.

       --share-principals | --no-share-principals (boolean)
          Enables  or  disables  Principal sharing when creating the portfolio
          share. If this flag is not provided, principal sharing is disabled.

          When you enable Principal Name Sharing for a  portfolio  share,  the
          share  recipient account end users with a principal that matches any
          of the associated IAM patterns can provision products from the port-
          folio.  Once  shared,  the  share recipient can view associations of
          PrincipalType : IAM_PATTERN on their portfolio. You can  create  the
          principals  in  the  recipient  account before or after creating the
          share.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
