PROVISION-PRODUCT()                                        PROVISION-PRODUCT()



NAME
       provision-product -

DESCRIPTION
       Provisions the specified product.

       A  provisioned  product is a resourced instance of a product. For exam-
       ple, provisioning a product that's based on an CloudFormation  template
       launches  an CloudFormation stack and its underlying resources. You can
       check the status of this request using  DescribeRecord .

       If the request contains a tag key with an empty list of values, there's
       a  tag conflict for that key. Don't include conflicted keys as tags, or
       this will cause the error "Parameter  validation  failed:  Missing  re-
       quired parameter in Tags[N ]:Value ".

       NOTE:
          When  provisioning  a  product that's been added to a portfolio, you
          must grant your user, group, or role access to  the  portfolio.  For
          more  information,  see Granting users access in the Service Catalog
          User Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --provisioning-preferences (structure)
          An object that contains information about the  provisioning  prefer-
          ences for a stack set.

          StackSetAccounts -> (list)
              One  or  more Amazon Web Services accounts where the provisioned
              product will be available.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              The specified accounts should be within  the  list  of  accounts
              from the STACKSET constraint. To get the list of accounts in the
              STACKSET constraint, use the DescribeProvisioningParameters  op-
              eration.

              If  no  values  are  specified, the default value is all acounts
              from the STACKSET constraint.

              (string)

          StackSetRegions -> (list)
              One or more Amazon Web Services Regions  where  the  provisioned
              product will be available.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              The  specified Regions should be within the list of Regions from
              the STACKSET constraint. To get  the  list  of  Regions  in  the
              STACKSET  constraint, use the DescribeProvisioningParameters op-
              eration.

              If no values are specified, the default  value  is  all  Regions
              from the STACKSET constraint.

              (string)

          StackSetFailureToleranceCount -> (integer)
              The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can
              fail before Service Catalog stops the operation in that  Region.
              If the operation is stopped in a Region, Service Catalog doesn't
              attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              Conditional: You must specify  either  StackSetFailureTolerance-
              Count or StackSetFailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

              The default value is 0 if no value is specified.

          StackSetFailureTolerancePercentage -> (integer)
              The percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this stack op-
              eration can fail before Service Catalog stops the  operation  in
              that  Region.  If  the operation is stopped in a Region, Service
              Catalog doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              When calculating the number of accounts based on  the  specified
              percentage,  Service  Catalog rounds down to the next whole num-
              ber.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              Conditional: You must specify  either  StackSetFailureTolerance-
              Count or StackSetFailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

          StackSetMaxConcurrencyCount -> (integer)
              The  maximum  number of accounts in which to perform this opera-
              tion at one time. This is dependent on the  value  of  StackSet-
              FailureToleranceCount  .  StackSetMaxConcurrentCount  is at most
              one more than the StackSetFailureToleranceCount .

              Note that this setting lets you specify the maximum  for  opera-
              tions.  For  large  deployments, under certain circumstances the
              actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may  be  lower
              due to service throttling.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              Conditional:  You must specify either StackSetMaxConcurrentCount
              or StackSetMaxConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

          StackSetMaxConcurrencyPercentage -> (integer)
              The maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this  op-
              eration at one time.

              When  calculating  the number of accounts based on the specified
              percentage, Service Catalog rounds down to the next  whole  num-
              ber.  This is true except in cases where rounding down would re-
              sult is zero. In this case, Service Catalog sets the number as 1
              instead.

              Note  that  this setting lets you specify the maximum for opera-
              tions. For large deployments, under  certain  circumstances  the
              actual  number  of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower
              due to service throttling.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              Conditional: You must specify either  StackSetMaxConcurrentCount
              or StackSetMaxConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

          }

       --tags (list)
          One or more tags.

          (structure)
              Information  about  a  tag.  A tag is a key-value pair. Tags are
              propagated to the resources created when provisioning a product.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for this key.

       --provision-token (string)
          An  idempotency  token that uniquely identifies the provisioning re-
          quest.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
