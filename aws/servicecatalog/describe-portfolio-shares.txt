NAME
       describe-portfolio-shares -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a summary of each of the portfolio shares that were created for
       the specified portfolio.

       You can use this API to  determine  which  accounts  or  organizational
       nodes this portfolio have been shared, whether the recipient entity has
       imported the share, and whether TagOptions are included with the share.

       The PortfolioId and Type parameters are both required.

OPTIONS
       --portfolio-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the portfolio for which shares will be  re-
          trieved.

       --type (string)
          The  type of portfolio share to summarize. This field acts as a fil-
          ter on the type of portfolio share, which can be one of the  follow-
          ing:

          1. ACCOUNT - Represents an external account to account share.

          2. ORGANIZATION  - Represents a share to an organization. This share
             is available to every account in the organization.

          3. ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT - Represents a  share  to  an  organizational
             unit.

          4. ORGANIZATION_MEMBER_ACCOUNT - Represents a share to an account in
             the organization.

          Possible values:

          o ACCOUNT

          o ORGANIZATION

          o ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT

          o ORGANIZATION_MEMBER_ACCOUNT

       --page-token (string)
          The page token for the next set of results. To  retrieve  the  first
          set of results, use null.

       --page-size (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return with this call.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
