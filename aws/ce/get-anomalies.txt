OPTIONS
       --monitor-arn (string)
          Retrieves  all  of  the  cost anomalies detected for a specific cost
          anomaly monitor Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       --date-interval (structure)
          Assigns the start and end dates for retrieving cost  anomalies.  The
          returned anomaly object will have an AnomalyEndDate in the specified
          time range.

          StartDate -> (string)
              The first date an anomaly was observed.

          EndDate -> (string)
              The last date an anomaly was observed.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          StartDate=string,EndDate=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "StartDate": "string",
            "EndDate": "string"
          }

       --feedback (string)
          Filters anomaly results by the feedback field on the anomaly object.

          Possible values:

          o YES

          o NO

          o PLANNED_ACTIVITY

       --total-impact (structure)
          Filters anomaly results by the total impact field on the anomaly ob-
          ject.  For  example, you can filter anomalies GREATER_THAN 200.00 to
          retrieve anomalies, with an estimated  dollar  impact  greater  than
          200.

          NumericOperator -> (string)
              The comparing value that's used in the filter.

          StartValue -> (double)
              The lower bound dollar value that's used in the filter.

          EndValue -> (double)
              The upper bound dollar value that's used in the filter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NumericOperator=string,StartValue=double,EndValue=double

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "NumericOperator": "EQUAL"|"GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL"|"LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL"|"GREATER_THAN"|"LESS_THAN"|"BETWEEN",
            "StartValue": double,
            "EndValue": double
          }

       --next-page-token (string)
          The  token  to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon Web Services
          provides the token when the response from a previous call  has  more
          results than the maximum page size.

       --max-results (integer)
          The number of entries a paginated response contains.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                     a  cost anomaly is observed. The linked account name will
                     only be available when the account name  can  be  identi-

                        The  Amazon Web Servicesservice name that's associated

              AnomalyScore -> (structure)
                 The latest and maximum score for the anomaly.

                 MaxScore -> (double)
                     The maximum score that's  observed  during  the  Anomaly-

                 MaxImpact -> (double)
                     The maximum dollar value that's observed for an anomaly.

                 TotalImpact -> (double)
                     The cumulative dollar difference between the total actual
                     spend and total expected spend. It is calculated as Tota-
                     lActualSpend - TotalExpectedSpend .

                 TotalActualSpend -> (double)
                     The cumulative dollar amount that was actually spent dur-

                     The cumulative dollar amount  that  was  expected  to  be

                     machine learning models to determine the typical spending
                     pattern based on historical data for a customer.

                     as (TotalImpact / TotalExpectedSpend) * 100 . When Total-
                     ExpectedSpend is zero, this field  is  omitted.  Expected
                     spend can be zero in situations such as when you start to
                     use a service for the first time.

              MonitorArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the cost monitor that gen-
                 erated this anomaly.

              Feedback -> (string)
                 The feedback value.

       NextPageToken -> (string)
          The  token  to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon Web Services
          provides the token when the response from a previous call  has  more
          results than the maximum page size.
