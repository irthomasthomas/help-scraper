NAME
       describe-cost-category-definition -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  name,  Amazon Resource Name (ARN), rules, definition, and
       effective dates of a Cost Category that's defined in the account.

       You have the option to use EffectiveOn to return a Cost Category that's
       active on a specific date. If there's no EffectiveOn specified, you see
       a Cost Category that's effective on the current date. If Cost  Category
       is still effective, EffectiveEnd is omitted in the response.

OPTIONS
       --cost-category-arn (string)
          The unique identifier for your Cost Category.

       --effective-on (string)
          The date when the Cost Category was effective.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       CostCategory -> (structure)
          The  structure  of  Cost Categories. This includes detailed metadata
          and the set of rules for the CostCategory object.

          CostCategoryArn -> (string)
              The unique identifier for your Cost Category.

          EffectiveStart -> (string)
              The effective start date of your Cost Category.

          EffectiveEnd -> (string)
              The effective end date of your Cost Category.

          Name -> (string)
              The unique name of the Cost Category.

          RuleVersion -> (string)
              The rule schema version in this particular Cost Category.

          Rules -> (list)
              The rules are processed in order. If there  are  multiple  rules
              that  match  the line item, then the first rule to match is used
              to determine that Cost Category value.

              (structure)
                 Rules are processed in order. If  there  are  multiple  rules
                 that  match  the  line  item, then the first rule to match is
                 used to determine that Cost Category value.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The default value for the cost category.

                 Rule -> (structure)
                     An Expression object used to categorize costs. This  sup-
                     ports dimensions, tags, and nested expressions. Currently
                     the only dimensions supported are LINKED_ACCOUNT  ,  SER-
                     VICE_CODE  , RECORD_TYPE , LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME , REGION ,
                     and USAGE_TYPE .
                        RECORD_TYPE is a  dimension  used  for  Cost  Explorer
                        APIs,  and is also supported for Cost Category expres-
                        sions. This dimension uses different terms,  depending
                        on  whether  you're using the console or API/JSON edi-
                        tor. For a detailed comparison, see  Term  Comparisons
                        in the Billing and Cost Management User Guide .

                     Or -> (list)
                        Return results that match either Dimension object.

                        (structure)
                            Use  Expression to filter in various Cost Explorer
                            APIs.

                            Not all Expression types  are  supported  in  each
                            API.  Refer to the documentation for each specific
                            API to see what is supported.

                            There are two patterns:

                            o Simple dimension values.

                              o There are three types of simple dimension val-
                                ues: CostCategories , Tags , and Dimensions .

                                o Specify the CostCategories field to define a
                                  filter that acts on Cost Categories.

                                o Specify the Tags field to  define  a  filter
                                  that acts on Cost Allocation Tags.

                                o Specify  the  Dimensions  field  to define a
                                  filter that acts on  the  `  DimensionValues
                                  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues.html`__
                                  .

                              o For each filter type, you can set  the  dimen-
                                sion  name and values for the filters that you
                                plan to use.

                                o For  example,  you  can   filter   for   RE-
                                  GION==us-east-1  OR  REGION==us-west-1 . For
                                  GetRightsizingRecommendation , the Region is
                                  a  full  name  (for example, REGION==US East
                                  (N. Virginia) .

                                o The corresponding Expression for this  exam-
                                  ple  is as follows: { "Dimensions": { "Key":
                                  "REGION",    "Values":    [     "us-east-1",
                                  "us-west-1" ] } }

                                o As  shown  in the previous example, lists of
                                  dimension values are combined with  OR  when
                                  applying the filter.

                              o You  can  also  set different match options to
                                further control how the  filter  behaves.  Not
                                all  APIs  support match options. Refer to the
                                documentation for each  specific  API  to  see
                                what is supported.

                                o For  example,  you can filter for linked ac-
                                  count names that start with "a".

                                o The corresponding Expression for this  exam-
                                  ple  is as follows: { "Dimensions": { "Key":
                                  "LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME",   "MatchOptions":   [
                                  "STARTS_WITH" ], "Values": [ "a" ] } }

                            o Compound  Expression  types  with logical opera-
                              tions.

                              o You can use multiple Expression types and  the
                                logical  operators AND/OR/NOT to create a list
                                of one or more Expression  objects.  By  doing
                                this, you can filter by more advanced options.

                              o For  example,  you  can  filter by ((REGION ==
                                us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type
                                == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) .

                              o The  corresponding Expression for this example
                                is as follows: { "And": [  {"Or":  [  {"Dimen-
                                sions":   {   "Key":   "REGION",  "Values":  [
                                "us-east-1",  "us-west-1"  ]  }},  {"Tags":  {
                                "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]},
                                {"Not": {"Dimensions": { "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",
                                "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

                            NOTE:
                               Because each Expression can have only one oper-
                               ator, the service returns an error if more than
                               one  is  specified. The following example shows
                               an Expression object that creates an  error:  {
                               "And":  [  ...  ],  "Dimensions": { "Key": "US-
                               AGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                               The following is an example of the  correspond-
                               ing  error  message:  "Expression has more than
                               one roots. Only one root  operator  is  allowed
                               for  each expression: And, Or, Not, Dimensions,
                               Tags, CostCategories"

                            NOTE:
                               For the GetRightsizingRecommendation action,  a
                               combination  of  OR and NOT isn't supported. OR
                               isn't supported between  different  dimensions,
                               or  dimensions  and  tags. NOT operators aren't
                               supported.  Dimensions  are  also  limited   to
                               LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                               For   the  GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation
                               action, only  NOT  is  supported.  AND  and  OR
                               aren't  supported.  Dimensions  are  limited to
                               LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                            Or -> (list)
                               Return results that match either Dimension  ob-
                               ject.

                               ( ... recursive ... )

                            And -> (list)
                               Return  results  that  match both Dimension ob-
                               jects.

                               ( ... recursive ... )

                            ( ... recursive ... )Dimensions -> (structure)
                               The specific Dimension to use for Expression .

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The names of the metadata  types  that  you
                                   can  use  to filter and group your results.
                                   For example, AZ returns a  list  of  Avail-
                                   ability Zones.

                                   Not  all  dimensions  are supported in each
                                   API. Refer to the  documentation  for  each
                                   specific API to see what is supported.
                                      LINK_ACCOUNT_NAME  and  SERVICE_CODE can
                                      only be used in CostCategoryRule .

                                      ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_ABSOLUTE and  ANOM-
                                      ALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_PERCENTAGE  can only be
                                      used in AnomalySubscriptions .

                               Values -> (list)
                                   The metadata values that  you  can  use  to
                                   filter  and group your results. You can use
                                   GetDimensionValues to find specific values.

                                   (string)

                               MatchOptions -> (list)
                                   The match options that you can use to  fil-
                                   ter your results.
                                      MatchOptions  is only applicable for ac-
                                      tions related to Cost Category and Anom-
                                      aly Subscriptions. Refer to the documen-
                                      tation for each specific API to see what
                                      is supported.

                                   The  default  values  for  MatchOptions are
                                   EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE .

                        Return results that match both Dimension objects.

                        (structure)
                            Use Expression to filter in various Cost  Explorer
                            APIs.

                            Not  all  Expression  types  are supported in each
                            API. Refer to the documentation for each  specific
                            API to see what is supported.

                            There are two patterns:

                            o Simple dimension values.

                              o There are three types of simple dimension val-
                                ues: CostCategories , Tags , and Dimensions .

                                o Specify the CostCategories field to define a
                                  filter that acts on Cost Categories.

                                o Specify  the  Tags  field to define a filter
                                  that acts on Cost Allocation Tags.

                                o Specify the Dimensions  field  to  define  a
                                  filter  that  acts  on the ` DimensionValues
                                  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues.html`__
                                  .

                              o For  each  filter type, you can set the dimen-
                                sion name and values for the filters that  you
                                plan to use.

                                o For   example,   you   can  filter  for  RE-
                                  GION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1  .  For
                                  GetRightsizingRecommendation , the Region is
                                  a full name (for  example,  REGION==US  East
                                  (N. Virginia) .

                                o The  corresponding Expression for this exam-
                                  ple is as follows: { "Dimensions": {  "Key":
                                  "REGION",     "Values":    [    "us-east-1",
                                  "us-west-1" ] } }

                                o As shown in the previous example,  lists  of
                                  dimension  values  are combined with OR when
                                  applying the filter.

                              o You can also set different  match  options  to
                                further  control  how  the filter behaves. Not
                                all APIs support match options. Refer  to  the
                                documentation  for  each  specific  API to see
                                what is supported.

                                o For example, you can filter for  linked  ac-
                                  count names that start with "a".

                                o The  corresponding Expression for this exam-
                                  ple is as follows: { "Dimensions": {  "Key":
                                  "LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME",   "MatchOptions":   [
                                  "STARTS_WITH" ], "Values": [ "a" ] } }

                            o Compound Expression types  with  logical  opera-
                              tions.

                              o You  can use multiple Expression types and the
                                logical operators AND/OR/NOT to create a  list
                                of  one  or  more Expression objects. By doing
                                this, you can filter by more advanced options.

                              o For example, you can  filter  by  ((REGION  ==
                                us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type
                                == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) .

                              o The corresponding Expression for this  example
                                is  as  follows:  { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimen-
                                sions":  {  "Key":   "REGION",   "Values":   [
                                "us-east-1",  "us-west-1"  ]  }},  {"Tags":  {
                                "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]},
                                {"Not":  {"Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE",
                                "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

                            NOTE:
                               Because each Expression can have only one oper-
                               ator, the service returns an error if more than
                               one is specified. The following  example  shows
                               an  Expression  object that creates an error: {
                               "And": [ ... ],  "Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "US-
                               AGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                               The  following is an example of the correspond-
                               ing error message: "Expression  has  more  than
                               one  roots.  Only  one root operator is allowed
                               for each expression: And, Or, Not,  Dimensions,
                               Tags, CostCategories"

                            NOTE:
                               For  the GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a
                               combination of OR and NOT isn't  supported.  OR
                               isn't  supported  between different dimensions,
                               or dimensions and tags.  NOT  operators  aren't
                               supported.   Dimensions  are  also  limited  to
                               LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                               For  the   GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation
                               action,  only  NOT  is  supported.  AND  and OR
                               aren't supported.  Dimensions  are  limited  to
                               LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                            Or -> (list)
                               Return  results that match either Dimension ob-
                               ject.

                               ( ... recursive ... )

                            And -> (list)
                               Return results that match  both  Dimension  ob-
                               jects.

                               ( ... recursive ... )

                            ( ... recursive ... )Dimensions -> (structure)
                               The specific Dimension to use for Expression .

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The  names  of  the metadata types that you
                                   can use to filter and group  your  results.
                                   For  example,  AZ  returns a list of Avail-
                                   ability Zones.

                                   Not all dimensions are  supported  in  each
                                   API.  Refer  to  the documentation for each
                                   specific API to see what is supported.

                                   The  metadata  values  that  you can use to
                                   filter and group your results. You can  use
                                   GetDimensionValues to find specific values.

                                   (string)

                               MatchOptions -> (list)

                     You  can  define the CostCategoryRule rule type as either
                     REGULAR or INHERITED_VALUE  .  The  INHERITED_VALUE  rule
                     type  adds  the flexibility to define a rule that dynami-
                     cally inherits the cost category  value.  This  value  is
                     from  the dimension value that's defined by CostCategory-
                     InheritedValueDimension . For example, suppose  that  you
                     want  to  costs  to  be  dynamically grouped based on the
                     value of a specific tag key. First, choose  an  inherited
                     value  rule  type,  and then choose the tag dimension and
                     specify the tag key to use.

                     split charge rules. To indicate uncategorized costs,  you
                     can use an empty string as the source.

                 Targets -> (list)
                     The  Cost  Category  values  that you want to split costs
