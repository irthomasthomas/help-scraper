OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          The  status  of  cost allocation tag keys that are returned for this
          request.

          Possible values:

          o Active

          o Inactive

       --tag-keys (list)
          The list of cost allocation tag keys that are returned for this  re-
          quest.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --type (string)
          The  type of CostAllocationTag object that are returned for this re-
          quest. The AWSGenerated type tags are tags that Amazon Web  Services
          defines  and  applies  to  support Amazon Web Services resources for
          cost allocation purposes. The UserDefined type tags  are  tags  that
          you define, create, and apply to resources.

          Possible values:

          o AWSGenerated

          o UserDefined

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon Web Services
          provides the token when the response from a previous call  has  more
          results than the maximum page size.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of objects that are returned for this request. By
          default, the request returns 100 results.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       CostAllocationTags -> (list)
          A  list  of cost allocation tags that includes the detailed metadata
          for each one.

          (structure)
              The cost allocation tag structure. This includes detailed  meta-
              data for the CostAllocationTag object.

              TagKey -> (string)
                 The key for the cost allocation tag.

              Type -> (string)
                 The  type of cost allocation tag. You can use AWSGenerated or
                 UserDefined type tags. AWSGenerated type tags are  tags  that
                 Amazon Web Services defines and applies to support Amazon Web
                 Services resources for cost allocation purposes.  UserDefined
                 type  tags are tags that you define, create, and apply to re-
                 sources.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of a cost allocation tag.

              LastUpdatedDate -> (string)
                 The last date that the tag was either  activated  or  deacti-
                 vated.

              LastUsedDate -> (string)
                 The  last  month  that the tag was used on an Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices resource.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon  Web  Services
          provides  the  token when the response from a previous call has more
          results than the maximum page size.
