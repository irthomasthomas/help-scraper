NAME
       get-savings-plans-utilization -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  Savings  Plans utilization for your account across date
       ranges with daily or monthly granularity. Management account in an  or-
       ganization have access to member accounts. You can use GetDimensionVal-
       ues in SAVINGS_PLANS to determine the possible dimension values.

       NOTE:
          You can't group by any dimension values for  GetSavingsPlansUtiliza-
          tion .

OPTIONS
       --time-period (structure)
          The  time  period  that  you want the usage and costs for. The Start
          date must be within 13 months. The End date must be after the  Start
          date,  and before the current date. Future dates can't be used as an
          End date.

          Start -> (string)
              The beginning of the time period. The start date  is  inclusive.
              For  example,  if  start is 2017-01-01 , Amazon Web Services re-
              trieves cost and usage data starting at 2017-01-01 up to the end
              date.  The start date must be equal to or no later than the cur-
              rent date to avoid a validation error.

          End -> (string)
              The end of the time period. The end date is exclusive. For exam-
              ple,  if  end is 2017-05-01 , Amazon Web Services retrieves cost
              and usage data from the start date up  to,  but  not  including,
              2017-05-01 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Start=string,End=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Start": "string",
            "End": "string"
          }

       --granularity (string)
          The  granularity  of  the  Amazon Web Services utillization data for
          your Savings Plans.

          The GetSavingsPlansUtilization operation  supports  only  DAILY  and
          MONTHLY granularities.

          Possible values:

          o DAILY

          o MONTHLY

          o HOURLY

       --filter (structure)
          Filters  Savings  Plans utilization coverage data for active Savings
          Plans dimensions. You can filter data with the following dimensions:

          o LINKED_ACCOUNT

          o SAVINGS_PLAN_ARN

          o SAVINGS_PLANS_TYPE

          o REGION

          o PAYMENT_OPTION

          o INSTANCE_TYPE_FAMILY
              GetSavingsPlansUtilization uses the same  Expression  object  as
              the  other  operations, but only AND is supported among each di-
              mension.

          Or -> (list)
              Return results that match either Dimension object.

              (structure)
                 Use Expression to filter by cost or by usage. There  are  two
                 patterns:

                 o Simple  dimension  values  - You can set the dimension name
                   and values for the filters that you plan to use. For  exam-
                   ple,   you   can   filter   for  REGION==us-east-1  OR  RE-
                   GION==us-west-1 . For  GetRightsizingRecommendation  ,  the
                   Region  is  a  full  name (for example, REGION==US East (N.
                   Virginia) . The Expression example is as follows:   {  "Di-
                   mensions":  {  "Key":  "REGION",  "Values":  [ "us-east-1",
                   us-west-1 ] } }   The list of dimension values are OR'd to-
                   gether  to  retrieve cost or usage data. You can create Ex-
                   pression and DimensionValues  objects  using  either  with*
                   methods or set* methods in multiple lines.

                 o Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can
                   use multiple Expression types  and  the  logical  operators
                   AND/OR/NOT  to  create a list of one or more Expression ob-
                   jects. By doing this, you can filter on more  advanced  op-
                   tions. For example, you can filter on ((REGION == us-east-1
                   OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type ==  Type1))  AND  (US-
                   AGE_TYPE  !=  DataTransfer) . The Expression for that is as
                   follows:  { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key":  "RE-
                   GION",  "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags":
                   { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] }  }  ]},  {"Not":
                   {"Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",  "Values": ["Data-
                   Transfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                        Because each Expression can have  only  one  operator,
                        the service returns an error if more than one is spec-
                        ified. The following example shows an  Expression  ob-
                        ject that creates an error.

                     {  "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": { "Dimension": "US-
                     AGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                 NOTE:
                     For the GetRightsizingRecommendation action,  a  combina-
                     tion  of  OR  and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators  aren't  supported. Dimensions are also limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                 Or -> (list)
                     Return results that match either Dimension object.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 And -> (list)
                     Return results that match both Dimension objects.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 ( ... recursive ... )Dimensions -> (structure)
                     The specific Dimension to use for Expression .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The names of the metadata types that you  can  use  to
                        filter and group your results. For example, AZ returns
                        a list of Availability  Zones.  LINK_ACCOUNT_NAME  and
                        SERVICE_CODE can only be used in CostCategoryRule .

                     Values -> (list)
                        The  metadata  values  that  you can use to filter and
                        group your results. You can use GetDimensionValues  to
                        find specific values.

                        (string)

                     MatchOptions -> (list)
                        The  match options that you can use to filter your re-
                        sults. MatchOptions is only applicable for actions re-
                        lated   to  Cost  Category.  The  default  values  for
                        MatchOptions are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key for the tag.

                     Values -> (list)

                 ings returns both net savings from Savings Plans and also the
                 onDemandCostEquivalent  of the Savings Plans when considering
                 the utilization rate.

                 NetSavings -> (string)
                     The savings amount that you're accumulating for the usage
                     that's  covered  by a Savings Plans, when compared to the
