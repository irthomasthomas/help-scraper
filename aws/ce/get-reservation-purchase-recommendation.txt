GET-RESERVATION-PURCHASE-RECOMMENDATIGET-RESERVATION-PURCHASE-RECOMMENDATION()



NAME
       get-reservation-purchase-recommendation -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  recommendations  for reservation purchases. These recommendations
       might help you to reduce your costs. Reservations provide a  discounted
       hourly rate (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand pricing.

       Amazon  Web Services generates your recommendations by identifying your
       On-Demand usage during a specific time period and collecting your usage
       into  categories  that are eligible for a reservation. After Amazon Web
       Services has these categories, it simulates every combination of reser-
       vations  in  each category of usage to identify the best number of each
       type of Reserved Instance (RI) to purchase to maximize  your  estimated
       savings.

       For  example,  Amazon Web Services automatically aggregates your Amazon
       EC2 Linux, shared tenancy, and c4 family usage in the US West  (Oregon)
       Region  and recommends that you buy size-flexible regional reservations
       to apply to the c4 family usage. Amazon  Web  Services  recommends  the
       smallest  size  instance in an instance family. This makes it easier to
       purchase a size-flexible Reserved Instance (RI).  Amazon  Web  Services
       also shows the equal number of normalized units. This way, you can pur-
       chase any instance size that you want. For this example, your RI recom-
       mendation is for c4.large because that is the smallest size instance in
       the c4 instance family.

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The account ID that's associated with the recommendation.

       --service (string)
          The specific service that you want recommendations for.

       --filter (structure)
          Use Expression to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

          Not all Expression types are supported in each  API.  Refer  to  the
          documentation for each specific API to see what is supported.

          There are two patterns:

          o Simple dimension values.

            o There are three types of simple dimension values: CostCategories
              , Tags , and Dimensions .

              o Specify the CostCategories field to define a filter that  acts
                on Cost Categories.

              o Specify  the  Tags  field to define a filter that acts on Cost
                Allocation Tags.

              o Specify the Dimensions field to define a filter that  acts  on
                the                      `                     DimensionValues
                https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues.html`__
                .

            o For  each filter type, you can set the dimension name and values
              for the filters that you plan to use.

              o For example, you  can  filter  for  REGION==us-east-1  OR  RE-
                GION==us-west-1  .  For GetRightsizingRecommendation , the Re-
                gion is a full name (for example,  REGION==US  East  (N.  Vir-
                ginia) .

              o The corresponding Expression for this example is as follows: {
                "Dimensions": {  "Key":  "REGION",  "Values":  [  "us-east-1",
                "us-west-1" ] } }

              o As  shown  in  the previous example, lists of dimension values
                are combined with OR when applying the filter.

            o You can also set different match options to further control  how
              the filter behaves. Not all APIs support match options. Refer to
              the documentation for each specific API  to  see  what  is  sup-
              ported.

              o For  example,  you  can  filter  for linked account names that
                start with "a".

              o The corresponding Expression for this example is as follows: {
                "Dimensions":  { "Key": "LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME", "MatchOptions":
                [ "STARTS_WITH" ], "Values": [ "a" ] } }

          o Compound Expression types with logical operations.

            o You can use multiple Expression types and the logical  operators
              AND/OR/NOT  to  create a list of one or more Expression objects.
              By doing this, you can filter by more advanced options.

            o For example, you can filter by ((REGION == us-east-1  OR  REGION
              ==  us-west-1)  OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != Data-
              Transfer) .

            o The corresponding Expression for this example is as  follows:  {
              "And":  [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [
              "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ]  }},  {"Tags":  {  "Key":  "TagName",
              "Values":  ["Value1"]  }  }  ]}, {"Not": {"Dimensions": { "Key":
              "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

          NOTE:
              Because each Expression can have only one operator, the  service
              returns  an  error  if more than one is specified. The following
              example shows an Expression object  that  creates  an  error:  {
              "And": [ ... ], "Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [
              "DataTransfer" ] } }

              The following is an example of the corresponding error  message:
              "Expression  has  more than one roots. Only one root operator is
              allowed for each expression: And,  Or,  Not,  Dimensions,  Tags,
              CostCategories"

          NOTE:
              For the GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a combination of OR
              and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't  supported  between  different
              dimensions,  or  dimensions  and tags. NOT operators aren't sup-
              ported. Dimensions are also limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION ,
              or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

              For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only NOT is
              supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions  are  limited
              to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

          Or -> (list)
              Return results that match either Dimension object.

              (structure)
                 Use Expression to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

                 Not  all Expression types are supported in each API. Refer to
                 the documentation for each specific API to see what  is  sup-
                 ported.

                 There are two patterns:

                 o Simple dimension values.

                   o There  are  three types of simple dimension values: Cost-
                     Categories , Tags , and Dimensions .

                     o Specify the CostCategories field  to  define  a  filter
                       that acts on Cost Categories.

                     o Specify  the Tags field to define a filter that acts on
                       Cost Allocation Tags.

                     o Specify the Dimensions field to define  a  filter  that
                       acts        on        the       `       DimensionValues
                       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues.html`__
                       .

                   o For  each filter type, you can set the dimension name and
                     values for the filters that you plan to use.

                     o For example, you can filter  for  REGION==us-east-1  OR
                       REGION==us-west-1  . For GetRightsizingRecommendation ,
                       the Region is a full name (for example, REGION==US East
                       (N. Virginia) .

                     o The  corresponding  Expression  for  this example is as
                       follows: { "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [
                       "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] } }

                     o As  shown  in  the previous example, lists of dimension
                       values are combined with OR when applying the filter.

                   o You can also set different match options to further  con-
                     trol  how  the filter behaves. Not all APIs support match
                     options. Refer to the documentation for each specific API
                     to see what is supported.

                     o For  example,  you  can filter for linked account names
                       that start with "a".

                     o The corresponding Expression for  this  example  is  as
                       follows:   {   "Dimensions":   {   "Key":   "LINKED_AC-
                       COUNT_NAME", "MatchOptions": [ "STARTS_WITH"  ],  "Val-
                       ues": [ "a" ] } }

                 o Compound Expression types with logical operations.

                   o You can use multiple Expression types and the logical op-
                     erators AND/OR/NOT to create a list of one  or  more  Ex-
                     pression  objects.  By doing this, you can filter by more
                     advanced options.

                   o For example, you can filter by ((REGION ==  us-east-1  OR
                     REGION  ==  us-west-1)  OR  (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (US-
                     AGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) .

                   o The corresponding Expression for this example is as  fol-
                     lows:  {  "And":  [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "RE-
                     GION",  "Values":  [  "us-east-1",  "us-west-1"   ]   }},
                     {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]},
                     {"Not": {"Dimensions": { "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",  "Values":
                     ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                     Because  each  Expression can have only one operator, the
                     service returns an error if more than one  is  specified.
                     The  following  example  shows  an Expression object that
                     creates an error: {  "And":  [  ...  ],  "Dimensions":  {
                     "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                     The  following  is  an example of the corresponding error
                     message: "Expression has more than one  roots.  Only  one
                     root  operator  is  allowed for each expression: And, Or,
                     Not, Dimensions, Tags, CostCategories"

                 NOTE:
                     For the GetRightsizingRecommendation action,  a  combina-
                     tion  of  OR  and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators  aren't  supported. Dimensions are also limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                 Or -> (list)
                     Return results that match either Dimension object.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 And -> (list)
                     Return results that match both Dimension objects.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 ( ... recursive ... )Dimensions -> (structure)
                     The specific Dimension to use for Expression .

                        filter and group your results. For example, AZ returns
                        a list of Availability Zones.

                        Not all dimensions are supported in each API. Refer to
                        the documentation for each specific API to see what is
                        supported.
                            LINK_ACCOUNT_NAME and  SERVICE_CODE  can  only  be
                            used in CostCategoryRule .

                     o For  example,  you  can filter for REGION==us-east-1 OR
                       REGION==us-west-1 . For GetRightsizingRecommendation  ,
                       the Region is a full name (for example, REGION==US East
                       (N. Virginia) .

                     o The corresponding Expression for  this  example  is  as
                       follows: { "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [
                       "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] } }

                     o As shown in the previous example,  lists  of  dimension
                       values are combined with OR when applying the filter.

                   o You  can also set different match options to further con-
                     trol how the filter behaves. Not all APIs  support  match
                     options. Refer to the documentation for each specific API
                     to see what is supported.

                     o For example, you can filter for  linked  account  names
                       that start with "a".

                     o The  corresponding  Expression  for  this example is as
                       follows:   {   "Dimensions":   {   "Key":   "LINKED_AC-
                       COUNT_NAME",  "MatchOptions":  [ "STARTS_WITH" ], "Val-
                       ues": [ "a" ] } }

                 o Compound Expression types with logical operations.

                   o You can use multiple Expression types and the logical op-
                     erators  AND/OR/NOT  to  create a list of one or more Ex-
                     pression objects. By doing this, you can filter  by  more
                     advanced options.

                   o For  example,  you can filter by ((REGION == us-east-1 OR
                     REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type  ==  Type1))  AND  (US-
                     AGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) .

                   o The  corresponding Expression for this example is as fol-
                     lows: { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "RE-
                     GION",   "Values":   [  "us-east-1",  "us-west-1"  ]  }},
                     {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]},
                     {"Not":  {"Dimensions":  { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values":
                     ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                     Because each Expression can have only one  operator,  the
                     service  returns  an error if more than one is specified.
                     The following example shows  an  Expression  object  that
                     creates  an  error:  {  "And":  [  ... ], "Dimensions": {
                     "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                     The following is an example of  the  corresponding  error
                     message:  "Expression  has  more than one roots. Only one
                     root operator is allowed for each  expression:  And,  Or,
                     Not, Dimensions, Tags, CostCategories"

                 NOTE:
                     For  the  GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a combina-
                     tion of OR and NOT isn't supported.  OR  isn't  supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators aren't supported. Dimensions are  also  limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .
