OPTIONS
       --granularity (string)
          How granular you want the data to be. You can enable data at  hourly
          or daily granularity.

          Possible values:

          o DAILY

          o MONTHLY

          o HOURLY

       --services (list)
          The  service metadata for the service or services you want to query.
          If not specified, all elements are returned.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --approximation-dimension (string)
          The service to evaluate for the usage records. You  can  choose  re-
          source-level  data  at daily granularity, or hourly granularity with
          or without resource-level data.

          Possible values:

          o SERVICE

          o RESOURCE

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Services -> (map)
          The service metadata for the service or services in the response.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (long)

       TotalRecords -> (long)
          The total number of usage records for all services in  the  services
          list.

       LookbackPeriod -> (structure)
          The lookback period that's used for the estimation.

          Start -> (string)
              The  beginning  of the time period. The start date is inclusive.
              For example, if start is 2017-01-01 , Amazon  Web  Services  re-
              trieves cost and usage data starting at 2017-01-01 up to the end
              date. The start date must be equal to or no later than the  cur-
              rent date to avoid a validation error.

          End -> (string)
              The end of the time period. The end date is exclusive. For exam-
              ple, if end is 2017-05-01 , Amazon Web Services  retrieves  cost
              and  usage  data  from  the start date up to, but not including,
              2017-05-01 .
