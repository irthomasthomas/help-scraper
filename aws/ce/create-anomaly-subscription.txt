CREATE-ANOMALY-SUBSCRIPTION()                    CREATE-ANOMALY-SUBSCRIPTION()



NAME
       create-anomaly-subscription -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds an alert subscription to a cost anomaly detection monitor. You can
       use each subscription to define subscribers with email or SNS notifica-
       tions.  Email  subscribers  can set an absolute or percentage threshold
       and a time frequency for receiving notifications.

OPTIONS
       --anomaly-subscription (structure)
          The cost anomaly subscription object that you want to create.

          SubscriptionArn -> (string)
              The AnomalySubscription Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

          AccountId -> (string)
              Your unique account identifier.

          MonitorArnList -> (list)
              A list of cost anomaly monitors.

              (string)

          Subscribers -> (list)
              A list of subscribers to notify.

              (structure)
                 The recipient of AnomalySubscription notifications.

                 Address -> (string)
                     The email address or SNS Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This
                     depends on the Type .

                 Type -> (string)
                     The notification delivery channel.

                 Status -> (string)
                     Indicates if the subscriber accepts the notifications.

          Threshold -> (double)
              (deprecated)

              An  absolute dollar value that must be exceeded by the anomaly's
              total impact (see Impact for more details) for an anomaly  noti-
              fication to be generated.

              This  field  has  been  deprecated.  To specify a threshold, use
              ThresholdExpression. Continued use of Threshold will be  treated
              as shorthand syntax for a ThresholdExpression.

              One of Threshold or ThresholdExpression is required for this re-
              source. You cannot specify both.

          Frequency -> (string)
              The frequency that anomaly notifications are sent. Notifications
              are sent either over email (for DAILY and WEEKLY frequencies) or
              SNS  (for  IMMEDIATE  frequency).  For  more  information,   see
              Creating an Amazon SNS topic for anomaly notifications .

          SubscriptionName -> (string)
              The name for the subscription.

          ThresholdExpression -> (structure)
              An Expression object used to specify the anomalies that you want
              to generate alerts for. This supports dimensions and nested  ex-
              pressions. The supported dimensions are ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_AB-
              SOLUTE and ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_PERCENTAGE , corresponding to an
              anomalys  TotalImpact  and  TotalImpactPercentage,  respectively
              (see Impact for more details). The supported  nested  expression
              types are AND and OR . The match option GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL is
              required. Values must be numbers between 0 and 10,000,000,000 in
              string format.

              One of Threshold or ThresholdExpression is required for this re-
              source. You cannot specify both.

              The following are examples of valid ThresholdExpressions:

              o Absolute threshold:  {  "Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "ANOMALY_TO-
                TAL_IMPACT_ABSOLUTE",             "MatchOptions":            [
                "GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL" ], "Values": [ "100" ] } }

              o Percentage threshold: { "Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "ANOMALY_TO-
                TAL_IMPACT_PERCENTAGE",            "MatchOptions":           [
                "GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL" ], "Values": [ "100" ] } }

              o AND two thresholds together: {  "And":  [  {  "Dimensions":  {
                "Key":   "ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_ABSOLUTE",   "MatchOptions":  [
                "GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL" ], "Values": [ "100" ] } }, {  "Dimen-
                sions":  { "Key": "ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_PERCENTAGE", "MatchOp-
                tions": [ "GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL" ], "Values": [ "100" ] } } ]
                }

              o OR two thresholds together: { "Or": [ { "Dimensions": { "Key":
                "ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_ABSOLUTE",       "MatchOptions":       [
                "GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL"  ], "Values": [ "100" ] } }, { "Dimen-
                sions": { "Key": "ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_PERCENTAGE",  "MatchOp-
                tions": [ "GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL" ], "Values": [ "100" ] } } ]
                }

              Or -> (list)
                 Return results that match either Dimension object.

                 (structure)
                     Use Expression to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

                     Not all Expression types are supported in each API. Refer
                     to the documentation for each specific API to see what is
                     supported.

                     There are two patterns:

                     o Simple dimension values.

                       o There are three types  of  simple  dimension  values:
                         CostCategories , Tags , and Dimensions .

                         o Specify the CostCategories field to define a filter
                           that acts on Cost Categories.

                         o Specify the Tags field to define a filter that acts
                           on Cost Allocation Tags.

                         o Specify  the  Dimensions  field  to define a filter
                           that    acts    on    the     `     DimensionValues
                           https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues.html`__
                           .

                       o For each filter type, you can set the dimension  name
                         and values for the filters that you plan to use.

                         o For  example,  you can filter for REGION==us-east-1
                           OR REGION==us-west-1 . For  GetRightsizingRecommen-
                           dation  ,  the  Region is a full name (for example,
                           REGION==US East (N. Virginia) .

                         o The corresponding Expression for this example is as
                           follows:  {  "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Val-
                           ues": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] } }

                         o As shown in the previous example, lists  of  dimen-
                           sion  values are combined with OR when applying the
                           filter.

                       o You can also set different match options  to  further
                         control  how the filter behaves. Not all APIs support
                         match options. Refer to the  documentation  for  each
                         specific API to see what is supported.

                         o For  example,  you  can  filter  for linked account
                           names that start with "a".

                         o The corresponding Expression for this example is as
                           follows:   {  "Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "LINKED_AC-
                           COUNT_NAME",  "MatchOptions":  [  "STARTS_WITH"  ],
                           "Values": [ "a" ] } }

                     o Compound Expression types with logical operations.

                       o You can use multiple Expression types and the logical
                         operators AND/OR/NOT to create a list of one or  more
                         Expression  objects. By doing this, you can filter by
                         more advanced options.

                       o For example, you can filter by ((REGION ==  us-east-1
                         OR  REGION  == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND
                         (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) .

                       o The corresponding Expression for this example  is  as
                         follows:  { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key":
                         "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ]  }},
                         {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } }
                         ]}, {"Not":  {"Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",
                         "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

                     NOTE:
                        Because  each  Expression  can have only one operator,
                        the service returns an error if more than one is spec-
                        ified.  The  following example shows an Expression ob-
                        ject that creates an error: { "And": [ ... ],  "Dimen-
                        sions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTrans-
                        fer" ] } }

                        The following is an example of the corresponding error
                        message: "Expression has more than one roots. Only one
                        root operator is allowed for each expression: And, Or,
                        Not, Dimensions, Tags, CostCategories"

                     NOTE:
                        For  the GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a combi-
                        nation of OR and NOT isn't supported.  OR  isn't  sup-
                        ported between different dimensions, or dimensions and
                        tags. NOT operators aren't supported.  Dimensions  are
                        also limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZ-
                        ING_TYPE .

                        For the  GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation  action,
                        only  NOT  is  supported. AND and OR aren't supported.
                        Dimensions are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                     Or -> (list)
                        Return results that match either Dimension object.

                        ( ... recursive ... )

                     And -> (list)
                        Return results that match both Dimension objects.

                        ( ... recursive ... )

                     ( ... recursive ... )Dimensions -> (structure)
                        The specific Dimension to use for Expression .

                        Key -> (string)
                            The names of the metadata types that you  can  use
                            to  filter and group your results. For example, AZ
                            returns a list of Availability Zones.

                            Not all dimensions are supported in each API.  Re-
                            fer  to the documentation for each specific API to
                            see what is supported.
                               LINK_ACCOUNT_NAME and SERVICE_CODE can only  be
                               used in CostCategoryRule .

                               ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_ABSOLUTE  and  ANOMALY_TO-
                               TAL_IMPACT_PERCENTAGE  can  only  be  used   in
                               AnomalySubscriptions .

                        Values -> (list)
                            The metadata values that you can use to filter and
                            group your results. You can use GetDimensionValues
                            to find specific values.

                            (string)

                        MatchOptions -> (list)
                            The  match options that you can use to filter your
                            results.
                               MatchOptions is only applicable for actions re-
                               lated  to  Cost  Category and Anomaly Subscrip-
                               tions. Refer to the documentation for each spe-
                               cific API to see what is supported.

                            The default values for MatchOptions are EQUALS and
                            CASE_SENSITIVE .

                            (string)

                     Tags -> (structure)

                        Key -> (string)
                            The key for the tag.

                        Values -> (list)
                            The specific value of the tag.

                            results.  MatchOptions  is only applicable for ac-
                            tions related to Cost Category. The default values
                            for MatchOptions are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE .

                            (string)

                     CostCategories -> (structure)

                 Return results that match both Dimension objects.

                 (structure)
                     Use Expression to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

                     Not all Expression types are supported in each API. Refer
                     to the documentation for each specific API to see what is
                     supported.

                     There are two patterns:

                     o Simple dimension values.

                       o There are three types  of  simple  dimension  values:
                         CostCategories , Tags , and Dimensions .

                         o Specify the CostCategories field to define a filter
                           that acts on Cost Categories.

                         o Specify the Tags field to define a filter that acts
                           on Cost Allocation Tags.

                         o Specify  the  Dimensions  field  to define a filter
                           that    acts    on    the     `     DimensionValues
                           https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues.html`__
                           .

                       o For each filter type, you can set the dimension  name
                         and values for the filters that you plan to use.

                         o For  example,  you can filter for REGION==us-east-1
                           OR REGION==us-west-1 . For  GetRightsizingRecommen-
                           dation  ,  the  Region is a full name (for example,
                           REGION==US East (N. Virginia) .

                         o The corresponding Expression for this example is as
                           follows:  {  "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Val-
                           ues": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] } }

                         o As shown in the previous example, lists  of  dimen-
                           sion  values are combined with OR when applying the
                           filter.

                       o You can also set different match options  to  further
                         control  how the filter behaves. Not all APIs support
                         match options. Refer to the  documentation  for  each
                         specific API to see what is supported.

                         o For  example,  you  can  filter  for linked account
                           names that start with "a".

                         o The corresponding Expression for this example is as
                           follows:   {  "Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "LINKED_AC-
                           COUNT_NAME",  "MatchOptions":  [  "STARTS_WITH"  ],
                           "Values": [ "a" ] } }

                     o Compound Expression types with logical operations.

                       o You can use multiple Expression types and the logical
                         operators AND/OR/NOT to create a list of one or  more
                         Expression  objects. By doing this, you can filter by
                         more advanced options.

                       o For example, you can filter by ((REGION ==  us-east-1
                         OR  REGION  == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND
                         (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) .

                       o The corresponding Expression for this example  is  as
                         follows:  { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key":
                         "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ]  }},
                         {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } }
                         ]}, {"Not":  {"Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",
                         "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

                     NOTE:
                        Because  each  Expression  can have only one operator,
                        the service returns an error if more than one is spec-
                        ified.  The  following example shows an Expression ob-
                        ject that creates an error: { "And": [ ... ],  "Dimen-
                        sions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTrans-
                        fer" ] } }

                        The following is an example of the corresponding error
                        message: "Expression has more than one roots. Only one
                        root operator is allowed for each expression: And, Or,
                        Not, Dimensions, Tags, CostCategories"

                     NOTE:
                        For  the GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a combi-
                        nation of OR and NOT isn't supported.  OR  isn't  sup-
                        ported between different dimensions, or dimensions and
                        tags. NOT operators aren't supported.  Dimensions  are
                        also limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZ-
                        ING_TYPE .

                        For the  GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation  action,
                        only  NOT  is  supported. AND and OR aren't supported.
                        Dimensions are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                            returns a list of Availability Zones.

                            Not all dimensions are supported in each API.  Re-

       --resource-tags (list)
          An optional list of tags to associate with the specified `  Anomaly-
          Subscription
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_AnomalySubscription.html`__
          .  You  can use resource tags to control access to your subscription
          using IAM policies.

          Each tag consists of a key and a value, and each key must be  unique
          for the resource. The following restrictions apply to resource tags:

          o Although  the  maximum number of array members is 200, you can as-
            sign a maximum of 50 user-tags to one resource. The remaining  are
            reserved for Amazon Web Services use

          o The maximum length of a key is 128 characters

          o The maximum length of a value is 256 characters

          o Keys  and values can only contain alphanumeric characters, spaces,
            and any of the following: _.:/=+@-

          o Keys and values are case sensitive

          o Keys and values are trimmed for any  leading  or  trailing  white-
            spaces

          o Dont  use  aws: as a prefix for your keys. This prefix is reserved
            for Amazon Web Services use

          (structure)
              The tag structure that contains a tag key and value.

              NOTE:
                 Tagging is supported only for the following Cost Explorer re-
                 source            types:           `           AnomalyMonitor
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_AnomalyMonitor.html`__
                 ,                    `                    AnomalySubscription
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_AnomalySubscription.html`__
                 ,                        `                       CostCategory
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_CostCategory.html`__
                 .

              Key -> (string)
                 The key that's associated with the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value that's associated with the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
