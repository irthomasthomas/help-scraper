NAME
       list-cost-category-definitions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the name, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), NumberOfRules and effec-
       tive dates of all Cost Categories defined in the account. You have  the
       option to use EffectiveOn to return a list of Cost Categories that were
       active on a specific date. If there is no EffectiveOn specified,  youll
       see  Cost  Categories  that  are effective on the current date. If Cost
       Category is still effective, EffectiveEnd is omitted in  the  response.
       ListCostCategoryDefinitions supports pagination. The request can have a
       MaxResults range up to 100.

OPTIONS
       --effective-on (string)
          The date when the Cost Category was effective.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon  Web  Services
          provides  the  token when the response from a previous call has more
          results than the maximum page size.

       --max-results (integer)
          The number of entries a paginated response contains.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
