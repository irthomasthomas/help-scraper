          o SAGEMAKER_SP

       --term-in-years (string)
          The savings plan recommendation term that's used to  generate  these
          recommendations.

          Possible values:

          o ONE_YEAR

          o THREE_YEARS

       --payment-option (string)
          The payment option that's used to generate these recommendations.

          o ALL_UPFRONT

          o LIGHT_UTILIZATION

          o MEDIUM_UTILIZATION

          o HEAVY_UTILIZATION

       --account-scope (string)
          The account scope that you want your recommendations for. Amazon Web
          Services calculates recommendations including the management account
          and  member  accounts if the value is set to PAYER . If the value is
          LINKED , recommendations are calculated for  individual  member  ac-
          counts only.

          Possible values:

          o PAYER

          o LINKED

       --next-page-token (string)
          The  token  to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon Web Services
          provides the token when the response from a previous call  has  more
          results than the maximum page size.

       --page-size (integer)
          The number of recommendations that you want returned in a single re-
          sponse object.

       --lookback-period-in-days (string)
          The lookback period that's used to generate the recommendation.

          Possible values:

          o SEVEN_DAYS

          o THIRTY_DAYS

          o SIXTY_DAYS

       --filter (structure)
          You  can  filter  your  recommendations  by  Account  ID  with   the
          LINKED_ACCOUNT  dimension. To filter your recommendations by Account
          ID, specify Key as LINKED_ACCOUNT and Value as  the  comma-separated
          Acount ID(s) that you want to see Savings Plans purchase recommenda-
          tions for.

          For GetSavingsPlansPurchaseRecommendation, the  Filter  doesn't  in-
          clude  CostCategories  or  Tags . It only includes Dimensions . With
          Dimensions , Key must be LINKED_ACCOUNT and Value can  be  a  single
          Account  ID or multiple comma-separated Account IDs that you want to
          see Savings Plans Purchase Recommendations for. AND and OR operators
          are not supported.

          Or -> (list)
              Return results that match either Dimension object.

              (structure)
                 Use Expression to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

                 Not  all Expression types are supported in each API. Refer to
                 the documentation for each specific API to see what  is  sup-
                 ported.

                 There are two patterns:

                 o Simple dimension values.

                   o There  are  three types of simple dimension values: Cost-
                     Categories , Tags , and Dimensions .

                     o Specify the CostCategories field  to  define  a  filter
                       that acts on Cost Categories.

                     o Specify  the Tags field to define a filter that acts on
                       Cost Allocation Tags.

                     o Specify the Dimensions field to define  a  filter  that
                       acts        on        the       `       DimensionValues
                       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues.html`__
                       .

                   o For  each filter type, you can set the dimension name and
                     values for the filters that you plan to use.

                     o For example, you can filter  for  REGION==us-east-1  OR
                       REGION==us-west-1  . For GetRightsizingRecommendation ,
                       the Region is a full name (for example, REGION==US East
                       (N. Virginia) .

                     o The  corresponding  Expression  for  this example is as
                       follows: { "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [
                       "us-east-1", us-west-1 ] } }

                     o As  shown  in  the previous example, lists of dimension
                       values are combined with OR when applying the filter.

                   o You can also set different match options to further  con-
                     trol  how  the filter behaves. Not all APIs support match
                     options. Refer to the documentation for each specific API
                     to see what is supported.

                     o For  example,  you  can filter for linked account names
                       that start with a.

                     o The corresponding Expression for  this  example  is  as
                       follows:   {   "Dimensions":   {   "Key":   "LINKED_AC-
                       COUNT_NAME", "MatchOptions": [ "STARTS_WITH"  ],  "Val-
                       ues": [ "a" ] } }

                 o Compound Expression types with logical operations.

                   o You can use multiple Expression types and the logical op-
                     erators AND/OR/NOT to create a list of one  or  more  Ex-
                     pression  objects.  By doing this, you can filter by more
                     advanced options.

                   o For example, you can filter by ((REGION ==  us-east-1  OR
                     REGION  ==  us-west-1)  OR  (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (US-
                     AGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) .

                   o The corresponding Expression for this example is as  fol-
                     lows:  {  "And":  [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "RE-
                     GION",  "Values":  [  "us-east-1",  "us-west-1"   ]   }},
                     {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]},
                     {"Not": {"Dimensions": { "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",  "Values":
                     ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                     Because  each  Expression can have only one operator, the
                     service returns an error if more than one  is  specified.
                     The  following  example  shows  an Expression object that
                     creates an error: {  "And":  [  ...  ],  "Dimensions":  {
                     "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                     The  following  is  an example of the corresponding error
                     message: "Expression has more than one  roots.  Only  one
                     root  operator  is  allowed for each expression: And, Or,
                     Not, Dimensions, Tags, CostCategories"

                 NOTE:
                     For the GetRightsizingRecommendation action,  a  combina-
                     tion  of  OR  and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators  aren't  supported. Dimensions are also limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                 Or -> (list)
                     Return results that match either Dimension object.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 And -> (list)
                     Return results that match both Dimension objects.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 ( ... recursive ... )Dimensions -> (structure)
                     The specific Dimension to use for Expression .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The names of the metadata types that you  can  use  to
                        filter and group your results. For example, AZ returns
                        a list of Availability Zones.

                        Not all dimensions are supported in each API. Refer to
                        the documentation for each specific API to see what is
                        supported.
                            LINK_ACCOUNT_NAME and  SERVICE_CODE  can  only  be
                            used in CostCategoryRule .

                            ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_ABSOLUTE    and   ANOMALY_TO-
                            TAL_IMPACT_PERCENTAGE  can   only   be   used   in
                            AnomalySubscriptions .

                     Values -> (list)
                        The  metadata  values  that  you can use to filter and
                        group your results. You can use GetDimensionValues  to
                        find specific values.

                        (string)

                     MatchOptions -> (list)
                        The  match options that you can use to filter your re-
                        sults.
                            MatchOptions is only applicable  for  actions  re-
                            lated  to Cost Category and Anomaly Subscriptions.
                            Refer to the documentation for each  specific  API
                            to see what is supported.

                        The  default  values  for  MatchOptions are EQUALS and
                        CASE_SENSITIVE .

                        (string)

                     MatchOptions -> (list)
                        The match options that you can use to filter your  re-
                        sults. MatchOptions is only applicable for actions re-
                        lated  to  Cost  Category.  The  default  values   for
                        MatchOptions are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE .

                     o Specify  the  Dimensions  field to define a filter that
                       acts       on       the        `        DimensionValues
                       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues.html`__
                       .

                   o For each filter type, you can set the dimension name  and
                     values for the filters that you plan to use.

                     o For  example,  you  can filter for REGION==us-east-1 OR
                       REGION==us-west-1 . For GetRightsizingRecommendation  ,
                       the Region is a full name (for example, REGION==US East
                       (N. Virginia) .

                     o The corresponding Expression for  this  example  is  as
                       follows: { "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [
                       "us-east-1", us-west-1 ] } }

                     o As shown in the previous example,  lists  of  dimension
                       values are combined with OR when applying the filter.

                   o You  can also set different match options to further con-
                     trol how the filter behaves. Not all APIs  support  match
                     options. Refer to the documentation for each specific API
                     to see what is supported.

                     o For example, you can filter for  linked  account  names
                       that start with a.

                     o The  corresponding  Expression  for  this example is as
                       follows:   {   "Dimensions":   {   "Key":   "LINKED_AC-
                       COUNT_NAME",  "MatchOptions":  [ "STARTS_WITH" ], "Val-
                       ues": [ "a" ] } }

                 o Compound Expression types with logical operations.

                   o You can use multiple Expression types and the logical op-
                     erators  AND/OR/NOT  to  create a list of one or more Ex-
                     pression objects. By doing this, you can filter  by  more
                     advanced options.

                   o For  example,  you can filter by ((REGION == us-east-1 OR
                     REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type  ==  Type1))  AND  (US-
                     AGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) .

                   o The  corresponding Expression for this example is as fol-
                     lows: { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "RE-
                     GION",   "Values":   [  "us-east-1",  "us-west-1"  ]  }},
                     {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]},
                     {"Not":  {"Dimensions":  { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values":
                     ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                     Because each Expression can have only one  operator,  the
                     service  returns  an error if more than one is specified.
                     The following example shows  an  Expression  object  that
                     creates  an  error:  {  "And":  [  ... ], "Dimensions": {
