OPTIONS
       --subscription-arn (string)
          A cost anomaly subscription Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       --threshold (double)
          (deprecated)

          The update to the threshold value for receiving notifications.

          This field has been deprecated. To update a threshold,  use  Thresh-
          oldExpression.  Continued use of Threshold will be treated as short-
          hand syntax for a ThresholdExpression.

          You can specify either Threshold  or  ThresholdExpression,  but  not
          both.

       --frequency (string)
          The update to the frequency value that subscribers receive notifica-
          tions.

          Possible values:

          o DAILY

          o IMMEDIATE

          o WEEKLY

       --monitor-arn-list (list)
          A list of cost anomaly monitor ARNs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --subscribers (list)
          The update to the subscriber list.

          (structure)
              The recipient of AnomalySubscription notifications.

              Address -> (string)
                 The email address or SNS Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This de-
                 pends on the Type .

              Type -> (string)
                 The notification delivery channel.

              Status -> (string)
                 Indicates if the subscriber accepts the notifications.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Address=string,Type=string,Status=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Address": "string",
              "Type": "EMAIL"|"SNS",
              "Status": "CONFIRMED"|"DECLINED"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --subscription-name (string)
          The new name of the subscription.

       --threshold-expression (structure)
          The  update  to  the Expression object used to specify the anomalies
          that you want to generate alerts for. This supports  dimensions  and
          nested  expressions.  The supported dimensions are ANOMALY_TOTAL_IM-
          PACT_ABSOLUTE and ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_PERCENTAGE , corresponding to
          an anomalys TotalImpact and TotalImpactPercentage, respectively (see
          Impact for more details). The supported nested expression types  are
          AND  and  OR  .  The match option GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL is required.
          Values must be numbers between 0 and 10,000,000,000 in  string  for-
          mat.

          You  can  specify  either  Threshold or ThresholdExpression, but not
          both.

          The following are examples of valid ThresholdExpressions:

          o Absolute threshold: { "Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "ANOMALY_TOTAL_IM-
            PACT_ABSOLUTE", "MatchOptions": [ "GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL" ], "Val-
            ues": [ "100" ] } }

          o Percentage threshold: { "Dimensions": { "Key":  "ANOMALY_TOTAL_IM-
            PACT_PERCENTAGE",  "MatchOptions":  [  "GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL"  ],
            "Values": [ "100" ] } }

          o AND two thresholds together: { "And": [ { "Dimensions":  {  "Key":
            "ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_ABSOLUTE",         "MatchOptions":         [
            "GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL" ], "Values": [ "100"  ]  }  },  {  "Dimen-
            sions":   {  "Key":  "ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_PERCENTAGE",  "MatchOp-
            tions": [ "GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL" ], "Values": [ "100" ] } } ] }

          o OR two thresholds together: { "Or": [  {  "Dimensions":  {  "Key":
            "ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_ABSOLUTE",         "MatchOptions":         [
            "GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL" ], "Values": [ "100"  ]  }  },  {  "Dimen-
            sions":   {  "Key":  "ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_PERCENTAGE",  "MatchOp-
            tions": [ "GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL" ], "Values": [ "100" ] } } ] }

          Or -> (list)
              Return results that match either Dimension object.

              (structure)
                 Use Expression to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

                 Not all Expression types are supported in each API. Refer  to
                 the  documentation  for each specific API to see what is sup-
                 ported.

                 There are two patterns:

                 o Simple dimension values.

                   o There are three types of simple dimension  values:  Cost-
                     Categories , Tags , and Dimensions .

                     o Specify  the  CostCategories  field  to define a filter
                       that acts on Cost Categories.

                     o Specify the Tags field to define a filter that acts  on
                       Cost Allocation Tags.

                     o Specify  the  Dimensions  field to define a filter that
                       acts       on       the        `        DimensionValues
                       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues.html`__
                       .

                   o For each filter type, you can set the dimension name  and
                     values for the filters that you plan to use.

                     o For  example,  you  can filter for REGION==us-east-1 OR
                       REGION==us-west-1 . For GetRightsizingRecommendation  ,
                       the Region is a full name (for example, REGION==US East
                       (N. Virginia) .

                     o The corresponding Expression for  this  example  is  as
                       follows: { "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [
                       "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] } }

                     o As shown in the previous example,  lists  of  dimension
                       values are combined with OR when applying the filter.

                   o You  can also set different match options to further con-
                     trol how the filter behaves. Not all APIs  support  match
                     options. Refer to the documentation for each specific API
                     to see what is supported.

                     o For example, you can filter for  linked  account  names
                       that start with "a".

                     o The  corresponding  Expression  for  this example is as
                       follows:   {   "Dimensions":   {   "Key":   "LINKED_AC-
                       COUNT_NAME",  "MatchOptions":  [ "STARTS_WITH" ], "Val-
                       ues": [ "a" ] } }

                 o Compound Expression types with logical operations.

                   o You can use multiple Expression types and the logical op-
                     erators  AND/OR/NOT  to  create a list of one or more Ex-
                     pression objects. By doing this, you can filter  by  more
                     advanced options.

                   o For  example,  you can filter by ((REGION == us-east-1 OR
                     REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type  ==  Type1))  AND  (US-
                     AGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) .

                   o The  corresponding Expression for this example is as fol-
                     lows: { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "RE-
                     GION",   "Values":   [  "us-east-1",  "us-west-1"  ]  }},
                     {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]},
                     {"Not":  {"Dimensions":  { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values":
                     ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                     Because each Expression can have only one  operator,  the
                     service  returns  an error if more than one is specified.
                     The following example shows  an  Expression  object  that
                     creates  an  error:  {  "And":  [  ... ], "Dimensions": {
                     "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                     The following is an example of  the  corresponding  error
                     message:  "Expression  has  more than one roots. Only one
                     root operator is allowed for each  expression:  And,  Or,
                     Not, Dimensions, Tags, CostCategories"

                 NOTE:
                     For  the  GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a combina-
                     tion of OR and NOT isn't supported.  OR  isn't  supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators aren't supported. Dimensions are  also  limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                 Or -> (list)
                     Return results that match either Dimension object.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 And -> (list)
                     Return results that match both Dimension objects.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 ( ... recursive ... )Dimensions -> (structure)
                     The specific Dimension to use for Expression .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The  names  of  the metadata types that you can use to
                        filter and group your results. For example, AZ returns
                        a list of Availability Zones.

                        Not all dimensions are supported in each API. Refer to
                        the documentation for each specific API to see what is
                        supported.
                            LINK_ACCOUNT_NAME  and  SERVICE_CODE  can  only be
                            used in CostCategoryRule .

                            ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_ABSOLUTE   and    ANOMALY_TO-
                            TAL_IMPACT_PERCENTAGE   can   only   be   used  in
                            AnomalySubscriptions .

                     Values -> (list)
                        The metadata values that you can  use  to  filter  and
                        group  your results. You can use GetDimensionValues to
                        find specific values.

                        (string)

                     MatchOptions -> (list)
                        The match options that you can use to filter your  re-
                        sults.
                            MatchOptions  is  only  applicable for actions re-
                            lated to Cost Category and Anomaly  Subscriptions.
                            Refer  to  the documentation for each specific API
                            to see what is supported.

                        The default values for  MatchOptions  are  EQUALS  and

                     MatchOptions -> (list)
                        The  match options that you can use to filter your re-
                        sults. MatchOptions is only applicable for actions re-
                        lated   to  Cost  Category.  The  default  values  for
                        MatchOptions are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE .

                       .

                   o For  each filter type, you can set the dimension name and
                     values for the filters that you plan to use.

                     o For example, you can filter  for  REGION==us-east-1  OR

                       the Region is a full name (for example, REGION==US East

                     o As  shown  in  the previous example, lists of dimension
                       values are combined with OR when applying the filter.

                       ues": [ "a" ] } }

                 o Compound Expression types with logical operations.

                   o You can use multiple Expression types and the logical op-
                     erators AND/OR/NOT to create a list of one  or  more  Ex-
                     pression  objects.  By doing this, you can filter by more
                     advanced options.

                   o For example, you can filter by ((REGION ==  us-east-1  OR
                     REGION  ==  us-west-1)  OR  (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (US-
                     AGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) .

                   o The corresponding Expression for this example is as  fol-
                     lows:  {  "And":  [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "RE-
                     GION",  "Values":  [  "us-east-1",  "us-west-1"   ]   }},
                     {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]},
                     {"Not": {"Dimensions": { "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",  "Values":
                     ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                     Because  each  Expression can have only one operator, the
                     service returns an error if more than one  is  specified.
                     The  following  example  shows  an Expression object that
                     creates an error: {  "And":  [  ...  ],  "Dimensions":  {
                     "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                     The  following  is  an example of the corresponding error
                     message: "Expression has more than one  roots.  Only  one
                     root  operator  is  allowed for each expression: And, Or,
                     Not, Dimensions, Tags, CostCategories"

                 NOTE:
                     For the GetRightsizingRecommendation action,  a  combina-
                     tion  of  OR  and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators  aren't  supported. Dimensions are also limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
