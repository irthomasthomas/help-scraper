NAME
       get-rightsizing-recommendation -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates recommendations that help you save cost by identifying idle and
       underutilized Amazon EC2 instances.

       Recommendations are generated  to  either  downsize  or  terminate  in-
       stances,  along with providing savings detail and metrics. For more in-
       formation about calculation and function, see Optimizing Your Cost with
       Rightsizing  Recommendations  in  the  Billing and Cost Management User
       Guide .

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Use Expression to filter by cost or by usage.  There  are  two  pat-
          terns:

          o Simple  dimension values - You can set the dimension name and val-
            ues for the filters that you plan to use.  For  example,  you  can
            filter  for REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1 . For GetRight-
            sizingRecommendation , the Region is a full name (for example, RE-
            GION==US  East  (N.  Virginia) . The Expression example is as fol-
            lows:  { "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1",
            us-west-1  ]  } }   The list of dimension values are OR'd together
            to retrieve cost or usage data. You can create Expression and  Di-
            mensionValues  objects  using either with* methods or set* methods
            in multiple lines.

          o Compound dimension values with logical operations -  You  can  use
            multiple  Expression types and the logical operators AND/OR/NOT to
            create a list of one or more Expression objects.  By  doing  this,
            you can filter on more advanced options. For example, you can fil-
            ter on ((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR  (TAG.Type
            ==  Type1))  AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) . The Expression for
            that is as follows:  { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions":  {  "Key":
            "REGION",  "Values":  [  "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags": {
            "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } }  ]},  {"Not":  {"Dimen-
            sions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

          NOTE:
                 Because  each Expression can have only one operator, the ser-
                 vice returns an error if more than one is specified. The fol-
                 lowing example shows an Expression object that creates an er-
                 ror.

              {  "And":  [  ...  ],  "DimensionValues":  {  "Dimension":  "US-
              AGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

          NOTE:
              For the GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a combination of OR
              and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't  supported  between  different
              dimensions,  or  dimensions  and tags. NOT operators aren't sup-
              ported. Dimensions are also limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION ,
              or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

              For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only NOT is
              supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions  are  limited
              to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

          Or -> (list)
              Return results that match either Dimension object.

              (structure)
                 Use  Expression  to filter by cost or by usage. There are two
                 patterns:

                 o Simple dimension values - You can set  the  dimension  name
                   and  values for the filters that you plan to use. For exam-
                   ple,  you  can  filter   for   REGION==us-east-1   OR   RE-
                   GION==us-west-1  .  For  GetRightsizingRecommendation , the
                   Region is a full name (for  example,  REGION==US  East  (N.
                   Virginia)  .  The Expression example is as follows:  { "Di-
                   mensions": {  "Key":  "REGION",  "Values":  [  "us-east-1",
                   us-west-1 ] } }   The list of dimension values are OR'd to-
                   gether to retrieve cost or usage data. You can  create  Ex-
                   pression  and  DimensionValues  objects  using either with*
                   methods or set* methods in multiple lines.

                 o Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can
                   use  multiple  Expression  types  and the logical operators
                   AND/OR/NOT to create a list of one or more  Expression  ob-
                   jects.  By  doing this, you can filter on more advanced op-
                   tions. For example, you can filter on ((REGION == us-east-1
                   OR  REGION  ==  us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (US-
                   AGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) . The Expression for that  is  as
                   follows:   { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "RE-
                   GION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }},  {"Tags":
                   {  "Key":  "TagName",  "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not":
                   {"Dimensions": {  "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",  "Values":  ["Data-
                   Transfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                        Because  each  Expression  can have only one operator,
                        the service returns an error if more than one is spec-
                        ified.  The  following example shows an Expression ob-
                        ject that creates an error.

                     { "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": { "Dimension":  "US-
                     AGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                 NOTE:
                     For  the  GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a combina-
                     tion of OR and NOT isn't supported.  OR  isn't  supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators aren't supported. Dimensions are  also  limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                 Or -> (list)
                     Return results that match either Dimension object.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 And -> (list)
                     Return results that match both Dimension objects.

                        filter and group your results. For example, AZ returns
                        a  list  of  Availability Zones. LINK_ACCOUNT_NAME and
                        SERVICE_CODE can only be used in CostCategoryRule .

                     Values -> (list)
                        The metadata values that you can  use  to  filter  and
                        group  your results. You can use GetDimensionValues to

          lies. You can also choose to view your estimated  savings  that  are
          associated  with recommendations with consideration of existing Sav-
          ings Plans or RI benefits, or neither.

       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
