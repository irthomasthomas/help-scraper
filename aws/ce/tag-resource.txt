TAG-RESOURCE()                                                  TAG-RESOURCE()



NAME
       tag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       An API operation for adding one or more tags (key-value pairs) to a re-
       source.

       You can use the TagResource operation with a resource that already  has
       tags.  If  you  specify a new tag key for the resource, this tag is ap-
       pended to the list of tags associated with the resource. If you specify
       a  tag  key  that  is already associated with the resource, the new tag
       value you specify replaces the previous value for that tag.

       Although the maximum number of array members is 200,  user-tag  maximum
       is 50. The remaining are reserved for Amazon Web Services use.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            tag-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          --resource-tags <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the resource. For a list of sup-
          ported resources, see ResourceTag .

       --resource-tags (list)
          A list of tag key-value pairs to be added to the resource.

          Each tag consists of a key and a value, and each key must be  unique
          for the resource. The following restrictions apply to resource tags:

          o Although  the  maximum number of array members is 200, you can as-
            sign a maximum of 50 user-tags to one resource. The remaining  are
            reserved for Amazon Web Services use

          o The maximum length of a key is 128 characters

          o The maximum length of a value is 256 characters

          o Valid  characters  for  keys  and  values are: A-Z , a-z , spaces,
            _.:/=+-

          o Keys and values are case sensitive

          o Keys and values are trimmed for any  leading  or  trailing  white-
            spaces

          o Dont  use  aws: as a prefix for your keys. This prefix is reserved
            for Amazon Web Services use

          (structure)
              The tag structure that contains a tag key and value.

              NOTE:
                 Tagging is supported only for the following Cost Explorer re-
                 source            types:           `           AnomalyMonitor
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_AnomalyMonitor.html`__
                 ,                    `                    AnomalySubscription
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_AnomalySubscription.html`__
                 ,                        `                       CostCategory
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_CostCategory.html`__
                 .

              Key -> (string)
                 The key that is associated with the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value that is associated with the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
