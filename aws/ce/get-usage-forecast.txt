OPTIONS
       --time-period (structure)
          The  start and end dates of the period that you want to retrieve us-
          age forecast for. The start date is included in the period, but  the
          end  date  isn't  included  in  the period. For example, if start is
          2017-01-01 and end is 2017-05-01 , then the cost and usage  data  is
          retrieved from 2017-01-01 up to and including 2017-04-30 but not in-
          cluding 2017-05-01 . The start date must be equal to or  later  than
          the current date to avoid a validation error.

          Start -> (string)
              The  beginning  of the time period. The start date is inclusive.
              For example, if start is 2017-01-01 , Amazon  Web  Services  re-
              trieves cost and usage data starting at 2017-01-01 up to the end
              date. The start date must be equal to or no later than the  cur-
              rent date to avoid a validation error.

          End -> (string)
              The end of the time period. The end date is exclusive. For exam-
              ple, if end is 2017-05-01 , Amazon Web Services  retrieves  cost
              and  usage  data  from  the start date up to, but not including,
              2017-05-01 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Start=string,End=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Start": "string",
            "End": "string"
          }

       --metric (string)
          Which metric Cost Explorer uses to create your forecast.

          Valid values for a GetUsageForecast call are the following:

          o USAGE_QUANTITY

          o NORMALIZED_USAGE_AMOUNT

          Possible values:

          o BLENDED_COST

          o AMORTIZED_COST

          o NET_UNBLENDED_COST

          o NET_AMORTIZED_COST

          o USAGE_QUANTITY

          o NORMALIZED_USAGE_AMOUNT

       --granularity (string)
          How granular you want the forecast to be. You can get  3  months  of
          DAILY forecasts or 12 months of MONTHLY forecasts.

          The GetUsageForecast operation supports only DAILY and MONTHLY gran-
          ularities.

          Possible values:

          o DAILY

          o MONTHLY

          o HOURLY

       --filter (structure)
          The filters that you want to use to filter your  forecast.  The  Ge-
          tUsageForecast API supports filtering by the following dimensions:

          o AZ

          o INSTANCE_TYPE

          o LINKED_ACCOUNT

          o LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME

          o OPERATION

          o PURCHASE_TYPE

          Or -> (list)
              Return results that match either Dimension object.

              (structure)
                 Use Expression to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

                 Not  all Expression types are supported in each API. Refer to
                 the documentation for each specific API to see what  is  sup-
                 ported.

                 There are two patterns:

                 o Simple dimension values.

                   o There  are  three types of simple dimension values: Cost-
                     Categories , Tags , and Dimensions .

                     o Specify the CostCategories field  to  define  a  filter
                       that acts on Cost Categories.

                     o Specify  the Tags field to define a filter that acts on
                       Cost Allocation Tags.

                     o Specify the Dimensions field to define  a  filter  that
                       acts        on        the       `       DimensionValues
                       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues.html`__
                       .

                   o For  each filter type, you can set the dimension name and
                     values for the filters that you plan to use.

                     o For example, you can filter  for  REGION==us-east-1  OR
                       REGION==us-west-1  . For GetRightsizingRecommendation ,
                       the Region is a full name (for example, REGION==US East
                       (N. Virginia) .

                     o The  corresponding  Expression  for  this example is as
                       follows: { "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [
                       "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] } }

                     o As  shown  in  the previous example, lists of dimension
                       values are combined with OR when applying the filter.

                   o You can also set different match options to further  con-
                     trol  how  the filter behaves. Not all APIs support match
                     options. Refer to the documentation for each specific API
                     to see what is supported.

                     o For  example,  you  can filter for linked account names
                       that start with "a".

                     o The corresponding Expression for  this  example  is  as
                       follows:   {   "Dimensions":   {   "Key":   "LINKED_AC-
                       COUNT_NAME", "MatchOptions": [ "STARTS_WITH"  ],  "Val-
                       ues": [ "a" ] } }

                 o Compound Expression types with logical operations.

                   o You can use multiple Expression types and the logical op-
                     erators AND/OR/NOT to create a list of one  or  more  Ex-
                     pression  objects.  By doing this, you can filter by more
                     advanced options.

                   o For example, you can filter by ((REGION ==  us-east-1  OR
                     REGION  ==  us-west-1)  OR  (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (US-
                     AGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) .

                   o The corresponding Expression for this example is as  fol-
                     lows:  {  "And":  [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "RE-
                     GION",  "Values":  [  "us-east-1",  "us-west-1"   ]   }},
                     {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]},
                     {"Not": {"Dimensions": { "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",  "Values":
                     ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                     Because  each  Expression can have only one operator, the
                     service returns an error if more than one  is  specified.
                     The  following  example  shows  an Expression object that
                     creates an error: {  "And":  [  ...  ],  "Dimensions":  {
                     "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                     The  following  is  an example of the corresponding error
                     message: "Expression has more than one  roots.  Only  one
                     root  operator  is  allowed for each expression: And, Or,
                     Not, Dimensions, Tags, CostCategories"

                 NOTE:
                     For the GetRightsizingRecommendation action,  a  combina-
                     tion  of  OR  and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators  aren't  supported. Dimensions are also limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                 Or -> (list)
                     Return results that match either Dimension object.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 And -> (list)
                     Return results that match both Dimension objects.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 ( ... recursive ... )Dimensions -> (structure)
                     The specific Dimension to use for Expression .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The names of the metadata types that you  can  use  to
                        filter and group your results. For example, AZ returns
                        a list of Availability Zones.

                        Not all dimensions are supported in each API. Refer to
                        the documentation for each specific API to see what is
                        supported.
                            LINK_ACCOUNT_NAME and  SERVICE_CODE  can  only  be
                            used in CostCategoryRule .

                            ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_ABSOLUTE    and   ANOMALY_TO-
                            TAL_IMPACT_PERCENTAGE  can   only   be   used   in
                            AnomalySubscriptions .

                     Values -> (list)
                        The  metadata  values  that  you can use to filter and
                        group your results. You can use GetDimensionValues  to
                        find specific values.

                        (string)

                     MatchOptions -> (list)
                        The  match options that you can use to filter your re-
                        sults.
                            MatchOptions is only applicable  for  actions  re-
                            lated  to Cost Category and Anomaly Subscriptions.
                            Refer to the documentation for each  specific  API
                            to see what is supported.

                        The  default  values  for  MatchOptions are EQUALS and
                        CASE_SENSITIVE .

                        The match options that you can use to filter your  re-
                        sults. MatchOptions is only applicable for actions re-
                        lated  to  Cost  Category.  The  default  values   for
                        MatchOptions are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE .

                     o Specify the Tags field to define a filter that acts  on
                       Cost Allocation Tags.

                     o Specify  the  Dimensions  field to define a filter that
                       acts       on       the        `        DimensionValues

                       .

                   o For each filter type, you can set the dimension name  and
                     values for the filters that you plan to use.

                     o For  example,  you  can filter for REGION==us-east-1 OR
                       REGION==us-west-1 . For GetRightsizingRecommendation  ,
                       the Region is a full name (for example, REGION==US East
                       (N. Virginia) .

                     o The corresponding Expression for  this  example  is  as
                       follows: { "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [

                     o As shown in the previous example,  lists  of  dimension
                       values are combined with OR when applying the filter.

                   o You  can also set different match options to further con-
                     trol how the filter behaves. Not all APIs  support  match
                     options. Refer to the documentation for each specific API
                     to see what is supported.

                     o For example, you can filter for  linked  account  names
                       that start with "a".

                     o The  corresponding  Expression  for  this example is as
                       follows:   {   "Dimensions":   {   "Key":   "LINKED_AC-
                       COUNT_NAME",  "MatchOptions":  [ "STARTS_WITH" ], "Val-
                       ues": [ "a" ] } }

                 o Compound Expression types with logical operations.

                   o You can use multiple Expression types and the logical op-
                     erators  AND/OR/NOT  to  create a list of one or more Ex-
                     pression objects. By doing this, you can filter  by  more
                     advanced options.

                   o For  example,  you can filter by ((REGION == us-east-1 OR
                     REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type  ==  Type1))  AND  (US-
                     AGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) .

                   o The  corresponding Expression for this example is as fol-
                     lows: { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "RE-
                     GION",   "Values":   [  "us-east-1",  "us-west-1"  ]  }},
                     {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]},
                     {"Not":  {"Dimensions":  { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values":
                     ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                     Because each Expression can have only one  operator,  the
                     service  returns  an error if more than one is specified.
                     The following example shows  an  Expression  object  that
                     creates  an  error:  {  "And":  [  ... ], "Dimensions": {
                     "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                     The following is an example of  the  corresponding  error
                     message:  "Expression  has  more than one roots. Only one
                     root operator is allowed for each  expression:  And,  Or,
                     Not, Dimensions, Tags, CostCategories"

                     For  the  GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a combina-
                     tion of OR and NOT isn't supported.  OR  isn't  supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators aren't supported. Dimensions are  also  limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

       --prediction-interval-level (integer)
          Amazon  Web  Services Cost Explorer always returns the mean forecast
          as a single point. You can request a prediction interval around  the
          mean  by  specifying  a  confidence level. The higher the confidence
          level, the more confident Cost Explorer is about  the  actual  value
          falling  in the prediction interval. Higher confidence levels result
          in wider prediction intervals.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Total -> (structure)
          How much you're forecasted to use over the forecast period.

          Amount -> (string)
              The actual number that represents the metric.

          Unit -> (string)
              The unit that the metric is given in.

       ForecastResultsByTime -> (list)
          The forecasts for your query, in order. For DAILY forecasts, this is
          a list of days. For MONTHLY forecasts, this is a list of months.

          (structure)
              The forecast that's created for your query.

              TimePeriod -> (structure)
                 The period of time that the forecast covers.

                 Start -> (string)
                     The beginning of the time period. The start date  is  in-
                     clusive. For example, if start is 2017-01-01 , Amazon Web
                     Services  retrieves  cost  and  usage  data  starting  at
                     2017-01-01  up  to  the  end date. The start date must be
                     equal to or no later than the current  date  to  avoid  a
                     validation error.

                 End -> (string)
                     The  end  of  the time period. The end date is exclusive.
                     For example, if end is 2017-05-01 , Amazon  Web  Services
                     retrieves  cost and usage data from the start date up to,
                     but not including, 2017-05-01 .

              MeanValue -> (string)
                 The mean value of the forecast.

              PredictionIntervalLowerBound -> (string)
                 The lower limit for the prediction interval.

              PredictionIntervalUpperBound -> (string)
                 The upper limit for the prediction interval.
