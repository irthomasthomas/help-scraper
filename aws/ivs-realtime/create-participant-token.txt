CREATE-PARTICIPANT-TOKEN()                          CREATE-PARTICIPANT-TOKEN()



NAME
       create-participant-token -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an additional token for a specified stage. This can be done af-
       ter stage creation or when tokens expire. Tokens always are  scoped  to
       the stage for which they are created.

       Encryption keys are owned by Amazon IVS and never used directly by your
       application.

OPTIONS
       --stage-arn (string)
          ARN of the stage to which this token is scoped.

       --duration (integer)
          Duration (in minutes), after which the token expires.  Default:  720
          (12 hours).

       --user-id (string)
          Name  that  can be specified to help identify the token. This can be
          any UTF-8 encoded text. This field is exposed to all stage  partici-

       --attributes (map)
          Application-provided attributes to encode into the token and  attach
          to  a stage. Map keys and values can contain UTF-8 encoded text. The

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --capabilities (list)
          Set of capabilities that the user  is  allowed  to  perform  in  the
          stage. Default: PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            PUBLISH
            SUBSCRIBE

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a stage participant token

       The  following  create-participant-token  example creates a participant
       toke for the specified stage.

          {
              "participantToken": {
                  "expirationTime": "2023-03-07T09:47:43+00:00",
                  "participantId": "ABCDEfghij01234KLMN6789",
