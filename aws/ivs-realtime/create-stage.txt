OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Optional name that can be specified for the stage being created.

       --participant-token-configurations (list)
          Array  of  participant  token configuration objects to attach to the
          new stage.

          (structure)
              Object specifying a participant token configuration in a stage.

              attributes -> (map)
                 Application-provided attributes to  encode  into  the  corre-
                 sponding  participant  token  and attach to a stage. Map keys
                 and values can contain UTF-8 encoded text. The maximum length
                 of  this  field  is  1 KB total. This field is exposed to all
                 stage participants and should  not  be  used  for  personally
                 identifying, confidential, or sensitive information.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              capabilities -> (list)
                 Set  of  capabilities  that the user is allowed to perform in
                 the stage.

                 (string)

              duration -> (integer)
                 Duration (in minutes), after which the corresponding partici-
                 pant token expires. Default: 60 (1 hour).

              userId -> (string)
                 Name that can be specified to help identify the corresponding
                 participant token. This can be any UTF-8 encoded  text.  This
                 field  is exposed to all stage participants and should not be
                 used for personally identifying, confidential,  or  sensitive
                 information.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attributes={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},capabilities=string,string,duration=integer,userId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "attributes": {"string": "string"
                ...},
              "capabilities": ["PUBLISH"|"SUBSCRIBE", ...],
              "duration": integer,
              "userId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --tags (map)
          Tags  attached  to  the  resource.  Array  of maps, each of the form
          string:string (key:value) . See Tagging AWS Resources  for  details,
          including restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits and
          requirements"; Amazon IVS has no constraints on tags beyond what  is
          documented there.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The  following  create-stage example creates a stage and stage partici-
       pant token for a specified user.

          aws ivs-realtime create-stage \
              --name stage1 \
              --participant-token-configurations userId=alice
