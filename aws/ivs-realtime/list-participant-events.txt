OPTIONS
       --stage-arn (string)
          Stage ARN.

       --session-id (string)
          ID of a session within the stage.

       --participant-id (string)
          Unique identifier for this participant. This is assigned by IVS  and
          returned by  CreateParticipantToken .

       --next-token (string)
          The  first  participant  event to retrieve. This is used for pagina-
          tion; see the nextToken response field.

       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum number of results to return. Default: 50.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get a list of stage participant events

       The following list-participant-events  example  lists  all  participant
       events  for  a  specified  participant ID and session ID of a specified
       stage ARN (Amazon Resource Name).

          aws ivs-realtime list-participant-events \
              --stage-arn arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:stage/abcdABCDefgh \
              --session-id st-a1b2c3d4e5f6g \
              --participant-id abCDEf12GHIj

       Output:

          {
              "events": [
                  {
                      "eventTime": "2023-04-26T20:36:28+00:00",
                      "name": "LEFT",
                      "participantId": "abCDEf12GHIj"
                  },
                  {
                      "eventTime": "2023-04-26T20:36:28+00:00",
                      "name": "PUBLISH_STOPPED",
                      "participantId": "abCDEf12GHIj"
                  },
                  {
                      "eventTime": "2023-04-26T20:30:34+00:00",
                      "name": "JOINED",
                      "participantId": "abCDEf12GHIj"
                  },
                  {
                      "eventTime": "2023-04-26T20:30:34+00:00",
                      "name": "PUBLISH_STARTED",
                      "participantId": "abCDEf12GHIj"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       events -> (list)
          List of the matching events.

          (structure)
              An occurrence during a stage session.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the event.

              participantId -> (string)
                 Unique  identifier  for  the  participant  who  triggered the
                 event. This is assigned by IVS.

              eventTime -> (timestamp)
                 ISO 8601 timestamp (returned as a string) for when the  event
                 occurred.

              remoteParticipantId -> (string)
                 Unique identifier for the remote participant. For a subscribe
                 event, this is the publisher. For a publish  or  join  event,
                 this is null. This is assigned by IVS.

              errorCode -> (string)
                 If the event is an error event, the error code is provided to
                 give insight into the specific error that  occurred.  If  the
                 event  is  not  an  error event, this field is null. INSUFFI-
                 CIENT_CAPABILITIES indicates that the  participant  tried  to
                 take  an action that the participants token is not allowed to
                 do. For more information about participant capabilities,  see
                 the capabilities field in  CreateParticipantToken . QUOTA_EX-
                 CEEDED indicates that the number of participants who want  to
                 publish/subscribe  to a stage exceeds the quota; for more in-
                 formation, see Service Quotas . PUBLISHER_NOT_FOUND indicates
                 that  the  participant tried to subscribe to a publisher that
                 doesnt exist.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If there are more events than maxResults , use nextToken in the  re-
          quest to get the next set.
