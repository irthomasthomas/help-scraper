SYNOPSIS
            get-ingest-configuration
          --arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          ARN of the ingest for which the information is to be retrieved.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ingestConfiguration -> (structure)
          The IngestConfiguration that was returned.

          arn -> (string)
              Ingest configuration ARN.

          ingestProtocol -> (string)
              Type of ingest protocol that the user employs for broadcasting.

          streamKey -> (string)
              Ingest-key value for the RTMP(S) protocol.

          stageArn -> (string)
              ARN  of  the stage with which the IngestConfiguration is associ-
              ated.

          participantId -> (string)
              ID of the participant within the stage.

          state -> (string)
              State of the ingest configuration. It is ACTIVE if  a  publisher
              currently  is publishing to the stage associated with the ingest
              configuration.

          userId -> (string)
              Customer-assigned name to help identify  the  participant  using
              the  IngestConfiguration; this can be used to link a participant
              to a user in the customers own systems. This can  be  any  UTF-8
              encoded  text.  This  field is exposed to all stage participants
              and should not be used for personally identifying, confidential,
              or sensitive information.

          attributes -> (map)
              Application-provided attributes to to store in the IngestConfig-
              uration and attach to a stage. Map keys and values  can  contain
              UTF-8 encoded text. The maximum length of this field is 1 KB to-
              tal. This field is exposed to all stage participants and  should
              not  be used for personally identifying, confidential, or sensi-
              tive information.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          tags -> (map)
              Tags attached to the resource. Array of maps, each of  the  form
              string:string (key:value) . See Best practices and strategies in
              Tagging AWS Resources and Tag Editor for details, including  re-
              strictions  that  apply  to  tags and "Tag naming limits and re-
              quirements"; Amazon IVS has no constraints on tags  beyond  what
              is documented there.

              key -> (string)
