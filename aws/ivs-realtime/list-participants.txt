OPTIONS
       --stage-arn (string)
          Stage ARN.

       --session-id (string)
          ID of the session within the stage.

       --filter-by-user-id (string)
          Filters  the  response list to match the specified user ID. Only one
          of filterByUserId , filterByPublished , filterByState ,  or  filter-
          ByRecordingState  can  be  provided  per request. A userId is a cus-
          tomer-assigned name to help identify the token; this can be used  to
          link a participant to a user in the customers own systems.

       --filter-by-published | --no-filter-by-published (boolean)
          Filters  the  response  list to only show participants who published
          during the stage session. Only one of filterByUserId ,  filterByPub-
          lished  ,  filterByState , or filterByRecordingState can be provided
          per request.

       --filter-by-state (string)
          Filters the response list to only show participants in the specified
          state.  Only  one  of  filterByUserId  , filterByPublished , filter-
          ByState , or filterByRecordingState can be provided per request.

          Possible values:

          o CONNECTED

          o DISCONNECTED

       --next-token (string)
          The first participant to retrieve. This is used for pagination;  see
          the nextToken response field.

       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum number of results to return. Default: 50.

       --filter-by-recording-state (string)
          Filters  the response list to only show participants with the speci-
          fied recording state. Only one of filterByUserId , filterByPublished
          ,  filterByState , or filterByRecordingState can be provided per re-
          quest.

          Possible values:

          o STARTING

          o ACTIVE

          o STOPPING

          o STOPPED

          o FAILED

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get a list of stage participants

       The following list-participants example lists all  participants  for  a
       specified session ID of a specified stage ARN (Amazon Resource Name).

          aws ivs-realtime list-participants \
              --stage-arn arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:stage/abcdABCDefgh \
              --session-id st-a1b2c3d4e5f6g

       Output:

          {
              "participants": [
                  {
                      "firstJoinTime": "2023-04-26T20:30:34+00:00",
                      "participantId": "abCDEf12GHIj"
                      "published": true,
                      "recordingState": "STOPPED",
                      "state": "DISCONNECTED",
                      "userId": ""
                  }
              ]
          }
