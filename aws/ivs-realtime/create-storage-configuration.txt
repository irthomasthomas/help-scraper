CREATE-STORAGE-CONFIGURATION()                  CREATE-STORAGE-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       create-storage-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new storage configuration, used to enable recording to Amazon
       S3. When a StorageConfiguration is created,  IVS  will  modify  the  S3
       bucketPolicy of the provided bucket. This will ensure that IVS has suf-
       ficient permissions to write content to the provided bucket.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Storage configuration name. The value does not need to be unique.

       --s3 (structure)
          A complex type that  contains  a  storage  configuration  for  where
          recorded video will be stored.

          bucketName -> (string)
              Location  (S3 bucket name) where recorded videos will be stored.
              Note that the StorageConfiguration and S3 bucket must be in  the
              same region as the Composition.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bucketName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "bucketName": "string"
          }

       --tags (map)
          Tags  attached  to  the  resource.  Array  of maps, each of the form
          string:string (key:value) . See Best  practices  and  strategies  in
          Tagging AWS Resources and Tag Editor for details, including restric-
          tions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits  and  requirements";
          Amazon  IVS  has  no  constraints  on tags beyond what is documented
          there.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a composition storage configuration

       The following create-storage-configuration example creates  a  composi-
       tion storage configuration with the specified properties.

          aws ivs-realtime create-storage-configuration \
              --name "test-sc" --s3 "bucketName=test-bucket-name"

       Output:

          {
              "storageConfiguration": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:ap-northeast-1:123456789012:storage-configuration/ABabCDcdEFef",
                  "name": "test-sc",
                  "s3": {
                      "bucketName": "test-bucket-name"
                  },
                  "tags": {}
              }
          }

       Stream in the Amazon Interactive Video Service User Guide.

                 Location  (S3  bucket  name)  where  recorded  videos will be

                 be in the same region as the Composition.
