SYNOPSIS
            get-storage-configuration
          --arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          ARN of the storage configuration to be retrieved.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get a composition storage configuration

       The  following  get-storage-configuration  example gets the composition
       storage configuration specified  by  the  given  ARN  (Amazon  Resource
       Name).

          aws ivs-realtime get-storage-configuration \
              --name arn "arn:aws:ivs:ap-northeast-1:123456789012:storage-configuration/abcdABCDefgh"

       Output:

          {
              "storageConfiguration": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:ap-northeast-1:123456789012:storage-configuration/abcdABCDefgh",
                  "name": "test-sc",
                  "s3": {
                      "bucketName": "test-bucket-name"
                  },
                  "tags": {}
              }
          }

       Stream in the Amazon Interactive Video Service User Guide.

OUTPUT
       storageConfiguration -> (structure)
          The StorageConfiguration that was returned.

          arn -> (string)
              ARN of the storage configuration.

          name -> (string)
              Name of the storage configuration.

          s3 -> (structure)
              An S3 destination configuration where recorded  videos  will  be
              stored.

              bucketName -> (string)
                 Location  (S3  bucket  name)  where  recorded  videos will be
                 stored. Note that the StorageConfiguration and S3 bucket must
                 be in the same region as the Composition.

          tags -> (map)
              Tags  attached  to the resource. Array of maps, each of the form
              string:string (key:value) . See Best practices and strategies in
              Tagging  AWS Resources and Tag Editor for details, including re-
              strictions that apply to tags and "Tag  naming  limits  and  re-
              quirements";  Amazon  IVS has no constraints on tags beyond what
              is documented there.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)
