DELETE-NAMESPACE()                                          DELETE-NAMESPACE()



NAME
       delete-namespace -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  namespace  from the current account. If the namespace still
       contains one or more services, the request fails.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-namespace
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the namespace that you want to delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete a namespace

       The following delete-namespace example deletes a namespace.

          aws servicediscovery delete-namespace \
              --id ns-ylexjili4cdxy3xm

       Output:

          {
              "OperationId": "gv4g5meo7ndmeh4fqskygvk23d2fijwa-k98y6drk"
          }

       To confirm that the operation succeeded, you can run get-operation. For
       more information, see get-operation .

       For  more information, see Deleting namespaces in the AWS Cloud Map De-
       veloper Guide.

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          A value that you can use to determine whether the request  completed
          successfully. To get the status of the operation, see GetOperation .
