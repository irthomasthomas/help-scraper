GET-INSTANCES-HEALTH-STATUS()                    GET-INSTANCES-HEALTH-STATUS()



NAME
       get-instances-health-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  current health status (Healthy , Unhealthy , or Unknown ) of
       one or more instances that are associated with a specified service.

       NOTE:
          There's a brief delay between when you register an instance and when
          the health status for the instance is available.

OPTIONS
       --service-id (string)
          The ID of the service that the instance is associated with.

       --instances (list)
          An array that contains the IDs of all the instances that you want to
          get the health status for.

          If you omit Instances , Cloud Map returns the health status for  all
          the instances that are associated with the specified service.

          NOTE:
              To get the IDs for the instances that you've registered by using
              a specified service, submit a ListInstances request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of instances that you want Cloud Map to return in
          the  response  to  a  GetInstancesHealthStatus request. If you don't
          specify a value for MaxResults , Cloud Map returns  up  to  100  in-
          stances.

       --next-token (string)
          For the first GetInstancesHealthStatus request, omit this value.

          If  more than MaxResults instances match the specified criteria, you
          can submit another GetInstancesHealthStatus request to get the  next
          group  of  results. Specify the value of NextToken from the previous
          response in the next request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Status -> (map)
          A complex type that contains the IDs and the health  status  of  the
          instances  that  you  specified  in the GetInstancesHealthStatus re-
          quest.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          If more than MaxResults instances match the specified criteria,  you
          can  submit another GetInstancesHealthStatus request to get the next
          group of results. Specify the value of NextToken from  the  previous
          response in the next request.
