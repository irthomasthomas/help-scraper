REGISTER-INSTANCE()                                        REGISTER-INSTANCE()



NAME
       register-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or  updates  one  or  more  records and, optionally, creates a
       health check based on the settings in a  specified  service.  When  you
       submit a RegisterInstance request, the following occurs:

       o For  each  DNS record that you define in the service that's specified
         by ServiceId , a record is created or  updated  in  the  hosted  zone
         that's associated with the corresponding namespace.

       o If the service includes HealthCheckConfig , a health check is created
         based on the settings in the health check configuration.

       o The health check, if any, is associated with each of the new  or  up-
         dated records.

       WARNING:
          One RegisterInstance request must complete before you can submit an-
          other request and specify the same service ID and instance ID.

       For more information, see CreateService .

       When Cloud Map receives a DNS query for the specified DNS name, it  re-
       turns the applicable value:

       o If the health check is healthy : returns all the records

       o If  the  health check is unhealthy : returns the applicable value for
         the last healthy instance

       o If you didn't specify a health check configuration : returns all  the
         records

       For  the current quota on the number of instances that you can register
       using the same namespace and using the same service, see Cloud Map quo-
       tas in the Cloud Map Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --service-id (string)
          The  ID of the service that you want to use for settings for the in-
          stance.

       --instance-id (string)
          An identifier that you want to associate with the instance. Note the
          following:

          o If the service that's specified by ServiceId includes settings for
            an SRV record, the value of InstanceId is  automatically  included
            as part of the value for the SRV record. For more information, see
            DnsRecord > Type .

          o You can use this value to update an existing instance.

          o To register a new instance, you must specify a value that's unique
            among instances that you register by using the same service.

          o If  you  specify  an existing InstanceId and ServiceId , Cloud Map
            updates the existing DNS records, if any. If there's also  an  ex-
            isting  health  check,  Cloud Map deletes the old health check and
            creates a new one.

          NOTE:
              The health check isn't deleted immediately, so it will still ap-
              pear  for  a while if you submit a ListHealthChecks request, for
              example.

          NOTE:
              Do not include sensitive information in InstanceId if the  name-
              space  is discoverable by public DNS queries and any Type member
              of DnsRecord for the service contains SRV because the InstanceId
              is discoverable by public DNS queries.

       --creator-request-id (string)
          A  unique  string that identifies the request and that allows failed
          RegisterInstance requests to be retried without the risk of  execut-
          ing  the  operation  twice.  You  must use a unique CreatorRequestId
          string every time you submit a RegisterInstance  request  if  you're
          registering additional instances for the same namespace and service.
          CreatorRequestId can be any unique string (for example, a  date/time
          stamp).

       --attributes (map)
          A string map that contains the following information for the service
          that you specify in ServiceId :

          o The attributes that apply to the records that are defined  in  the
            service.

          o For each attribute, the applicable value.

          NOTE:
              Do  not  include  sensitive information in the attributes if the
              namespace is discoverable by public DNS queries.

          Supported attribute keys include the following:
              AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME

          If you want Cloud Map to create an Amazon Route 53 alias record that
          routes  traffic  to an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, specify
          the DNS name that's associated with the load balancer. For  informa-
          tion  about  how  to  get  the  DNS name, see "DNSName" in the topic
          AliasTarget in the Route 53 API Reference .

          Note the following:

          o The configuration for the service that's  specified  by  ServiceId
            must include settings for an A record, an AAAA record, or both.

          o In  the service that's specified by ServiceId , the value of Rout-
            ingPolicy must be WEIGHTED .

          o If the service that's specified by ServiceId includes HealthCheck-
            Config  settings, Cloud Map will create the Route 53 health check,
            but it doesn't associate the health check with the alias record.

          o Auto naming currently doesn't support creating alias records  that
            route  traffic to Amazon Web Services resources other than Elastic
            Load Balancing load balancers.

          o If you specify a value for AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME , don't specify val-
            ues for any of the AWS_INSTANCE attributes.

            AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID
              HTTP  namespaces  only.  The  Amazon EC2 instance ID for the in-
              stance. If the AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID attribute is specified,  then
              the   only   other   attribute   that   can   be   specified  is
              AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS . When the AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID  attribute
              is  specified,  then  the  AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4  attribute  will be
              filled out with the primary private IPv4 address.
                 AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS

          If the service configuration includes HealthCheckCustomConfig ,  you
          can  optionally  use  AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS  to specify the initial
          status of the custom health check, HEALTHY or  UNHEALTHY  .  If  you
          don't  specify a value for AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS , the initial sta-
          tus is HEALTHY .
              AWS_INSTANCE_CNAME

          If the service configuration includes a  CNAME  record,  the  domain
          name  that  you  want  Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries
          (for example, example.com ).

          This value is required if the service  specified  by  ServiceId  in-
          cludes settings for an CNAME record.
              AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4

          If  the service configuration includes an A record, the IPv4 address
          that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries (for ex-
          ample, 192.0.2.44 ).

          This  value  is  required  if the service specified by ServiceId in-
          cludes settings for an A record. If the  service  includes  settings
          for  an SRV record, you must specify a value for AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4 ,
          AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6 , or both.
              AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6

          If the service configuration includes an AAAA record, the  IPv6  ad-
          dress  that  you  want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries
          (for example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345 ).

          This value is required if the service  specified  by  ServiceId  in-
          cludes settings for an AAAA record. If the service includes settings
          for an SRV record, you must specify a value for AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4  ,
          AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6 , or both.
              AWS_INSTANCE_PORT

          If the service includes an SRV record, the value that you want Route
          53 to return for the port.

          If the service includes HealthCheckConfig , the port on the endpoint
          that you want Route 53 to send requests to.

          This  value  is required if you specified settings for an SRV record
          or a Route 53 health check when you created the service.
              Custom attributes

          You can add up to 30 custom attributes. For each key-value pair, the
          maximum length of the attribute name is 255 characters, and the max-
          imum length of the attribute value is 1,024  characters.  The  total
          size  of  all  provided attributes (sum of all keys and values) must
          not exceed 5,000 characters.
              key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To register a service instance

       The following register-instance example registers a service instance.

          aws servicediscovery register-instance \
              --service-id srv-p5zdwlg5uvvzjita \
              --instance-id myservice-53 \
              --attributes=AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4=172.2.1.3,AWS_INSTANCE_PORT=808

       Output:

          {
              "OperationId": "4yejorelbukcjzpnr6tlmrghsjwpngf4-k95yg2u7"
          }

       To confirm that the operation succeeded, you can run get-operation. For
       more information, see get-operation .

       For  more  information,  see Registering instances in the AWS Cloud Map
       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          A value that you can use to determine whether the request  completed
          successfully. To get the status of the operation, see GetOperation .
