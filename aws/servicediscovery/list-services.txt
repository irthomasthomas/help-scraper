LIST-SERVICES()                                                LIST-SERVICES()



NAME
       list-services -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists summary information for all the services that are associated with
       one or more namespaces.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-services is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Services

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          A  complex type that contains specifications for the namespaces that
          you want to list services for.

          If you specify more than one filter, an  operation  must  match  all
          filters to be returned by ListServices .

          (structure)
              A  complex  type  that  lets you specify the namespaces that you
              want to list services for.

              Name -> (string)
                 Specify NAMESPACE_ID .

              Values -> (list)
                 The values that are applicable to the value that you  specify
                 for Condition to filter the list of services.

                 (string)

              Condition -> (string)
                 The operator that you want to use to determine whether a ser-
                 vice is returned by ListServices . Valid values for Condition
                 include the following:

                 o EQ  :  When  you  specify EQ , specify one namespace ID for
                   Values . EQ is the default condition and can be omitted.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string,Condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "NAMESPACE_ID",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Condition": "EQ"|"IN"|"BETWEEN"|"BEGINS_WITH"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 the service. Instances that were previously  associated  with
                 the  service  but  that  are  deleted  aren't included in the
                 count. The count might not reflect pending registrations  and
                 deregistrations.

              DnsConfig -> (structure)
                 Information  about  the  Route  53  DNS records that you want
                 Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

                 RoutingPolicy -> (string)
                     The routing policy that you want to apply to all Route 53
                     DNS  records  that Cloud Map creates when you register an
                     instance and specify this service.

                     NOTE:
                        If you want to use this service to register  instances
                        that  create  alias  records, specify WEIGHTED for the
                        routing policy.

                     You can specify the following values:
                        MULTIVALUE

                     If you define a health check  for  the  service  and  the
                     health  check is healthy, Route 53 returns the applicable
                     value for up to eight instances.

                     For example, suppose that the service includes configura-
                     tions  for  one  A record and a health check. You use the
                     service to register 10 instances. Route  53  responds  to
                     DNS queries with IP addresses for up to eight healthy in-
                     stances. If fewer than eight instances are healthy, Route
                     53  responds to every DNS query with the IP addresses for
                     all of the healthy instances.

                     If you don't define a health check for the service, Route
                     53 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the
                     values for up to eight instances.

                     see  Multivalue  Answer Routing in the Route 53 Developer
                     Guide .
                        WEIGHTED

                     Route 53 returns the applicable value from  one  randomly
                     selected  instance from among the instances that you reg-
                     istered using the same service.  Currently,  all  records
                     have  the  same  weight,  so you can't route more or less
                     traffic to any instances.

                     For example, suppose that the service includes configura-
                     tions  for  one  A record and a health check. You use the
                     service to register 10 instances. Route  53  responds  to
                     DNS queries with the IP address for one randomly selected
                     instance from among the  healthy  instances.  If  no  in-
                     stances  are healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries as
                     if all of the instances were healthy.

                     If you don't define a health check for the service, Route
                     53 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the
                     applicable value for one randomly selected instance.

                     see Weighted Routing in the Route 53 Developer Guide .

                 DnsRecords -> (list)
                     An  array  that  contains  one  DnsRecord object for each
                     Route 53 DNS record that you want  Cloud  Map  to  create
                     when you register an instance.

                     (structure)
                        A  complex  type  that  contains information about the
                        Route 53 DNS records that you want Cloud Map to create
                        when you register an instance.

                        Type -> (string)
                            The type of the resource, which indicates the type
                            of value that Route 53 returns in response to  DNS
                            queries.  You  can  specify values for Type in the
                            following combinations:

                            o

                              **

                            If you want Cloud Map to create a Route  53  alias
                            record when you register an instance, specify A or
                            AAAA for Type .

                            You specify other settings, such as the IP address
                            for  A  and AAAA records, when you register an in-
                            stance. For more information, see RegisterInstance
                            .

                            The following values are supported:
                               A

                            Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in
                            IPv4 format, such as 192.0.2.44.
                               AAAA

                            Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in
                            IPv6           format,           such           as
                            2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.
                               CNAME

                            Route 53 returns the domain name of the  resource,
                            such as www.example.com. Note the following:

                            o You  specify  the  domain  name that you want to
                              route traffic to when you register an  instance.
                              For  more  information,  see  Attributes  in the
                              topic RegisterInstance .

                            o You must specify WEIGHTED for the value of Rout-
                              ingPolicy .

                            o You  can't  specify both CNAME for Type and set-
                              tings for HealthCheckConfig . If you do, the re-
                              quest will fail with an InvalidInput error.

                              SRV

                            Route  53 returns the value for an SRV record. The
                            value for an SRV record uses the following values:
                               priority weight port service-hostname

                            Note the following about the values:

                            o The values of priority and weight are  both  set
                              to 1 and can't be changed.

                            o The  value of port comes from the value that you
                              specify for the AWS_INSTANCE_PORT attribute when
                              you submit a RegisterInstance request.

                            o The value of service-hostname is a concatenation
                              of the following values:

                              o The value that you specify for InstanceId when
                                you register an instance.

                              o The name of the service.

                              o The name of the namespace.

                            For  example, if the value of InstanceId is test ,
                            the name of the service is backend , and the  name
                            of  the  namespace  is  example.com , the value of
                            service-hostname is the following:
                               test.backend.example.com

                            If you specify settings for an  SRV  record,  note
                            the following:

                            o If  you  specify  values for AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4 ,
                              AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6 , or both in  the  RegisterIn-
                              stance  request, Cloud Map automatically creates
                              A and/or AAAA records that have the same name as
                              the value of service-hostname in the SRV record.
                              You can ignore these records.

                            o If you're using a system that  requires  a  spe-
                              cific  SRV format, such as HAProxy, see the Name
                              element in the documentation about CreateService
                              for information about how to specify the correct
                              name format.

                        TTL -> (long)
                            The amount of time, in seconds, that you want  DNS
                            resolvers to cache the settings for this record.

                            NOTE:
                               Alias records don't include a TTL because Route
                               53 uses the TTL for the Amazon Web Services re-
                               source  that an alias record routes traffic to.
                               If you include the AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME attribute
                               when you submit a RegisterInstance request, the
                               TTL value is ignored. Always specify a TTL  for
                               the  service; you can use a service to register
                               instances that create either alias or non-alias
                               records.

              HealthCheckConfig -> (structure)
                     Public  DNS and HTTP namespaces only. Settings for an op-
                     tional health check. If you specify settings for a health
                     check,  Cloud  Map  associates  the health check with the
                     records that you specify in DnsConfig .

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of health check that you want to  create,  which
                     indicates  how Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is
                     healthy.

                     WARNING:
                        You can't change the value of Type after you create  a
                        health check.

                     You can create the following types of health checks:

                     o HTTP : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If
                       successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and  waits
                       for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than
                       400.

                     o HTTPS : Route 53 tries to establish a  TCP  connection.
                       If  successful,  Route  53 submits an HTTPS request and
                       waits for an HTTP status code of  200  or  greater  and
                       less than 400.

                     WARNING:
                        If  you specify HTTPS for the value of Type , the end-
                        point must support TLS v1.0 or later.

                     o TCP : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.  If
                       you  specify  TCP  for Type , don't specify a value for
                       ResourcePath .

                     For more information, see How Route 53 Determines Whether
                     an Endpoint Is Healthy in the Route 53 Developer Guide .

                 ResourcePath -> (string)
                     The  path that you want Route 53 to request when perform-
                     ing health checks. The path can be any  value  that  your
                     endpoint returns an HTTP status code of a 2xx or 3xx for-
                     mat for when the endpoint is healthy. An example file  is
                     /docs/route53-health-check.html  . Route 53 automatically
                     adds the DNS name for the service. If you don't specify a
                     value for ResourcePath , the default value is / .

                     If  you  specify  TCP  for  Type , you must not specify a
                     value for ResourcePath .

                 FailureThreshold -> (integer)
                     The number of consecutive health checks that an  endpoint
                     must pass or fail for Route 53 to change the current sta-
                     tus of the endpoint from  unhealthy  to  healthy  or  the
                     other  way around. For more information, see How Route 53
                     Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy in the Route 53
                     Developer Guide .

              HealthCheckCustomConfig -> (structure)
                 Information  about  an optional custom health check. A custom
                 health check, which  requires  that  you  use  a  third-party
                 health  checker  to evaluate the health of your resources, is
                 useful in the following circumstances:

                 o You can't use a health check that's defined by HealthCheck-
                   Config because the resource isn't available over the inter-
                   net. For example, you can use a custom  health  check  when
                   the  instance  is in an Amazon VPC. (To check the health of
                   resources in a VPC, the health checker must also be in  the
                   VPC.)

                 o You  want to use a third-party health checker regardless of
                   where your resources are located.

                 WARNING:
                     If you specify a  health  check  configuration,  you  can
                     specify either HealthCheckCustomConfig or HealthCheckCon-
                     fig but not both.

                 FailureThreshold -> (integer)

                     WARNING:
                        This parameter is no longer supported  and  is  always
                        set to 1. Cloud Map waits for approximately 30 seconds
                        after  receiving  an  UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus
                        request  before changing the status of the service in-
                        stance.

                     The number of 30-second intervals that you want Cloud Map
                     to wait after receiving an UpdateInstanceCustomHealthSta-
                     tus request before it changes the health status of a ser-
                     vice instance.

                     Sending   a   second   or  subsequent  UpdateInstanceCus-
                     tomHealthStatus request with the  same  value  before  30
                     seconds  has  passed doesn't accelerate the change. Cloud
                     Map still waits 30 seconds after  the  first  request  to
                     make the change.

              CreateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the service was created.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response contains NextToken , submit another ListServices re-
          quest to get the next group of results. Specify the value of NextTo-
          ken from the previous response in the next request.

          NOTE:
              Cloud  Map  gets MaxResults services and then filters them based
              on the specified criteria. It's possible that no services in the
              first  MaxResults  services  matched  the specified criteria but
              that subsequent groups of MaxResults services  do  contain  ser-
              vices that match the criteria.
