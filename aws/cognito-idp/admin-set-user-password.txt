ADMIN-SET-USER-PASSWORD()                            ADMIN-SET-USER-PASSWORD()



NAME
       admin-set-user-password -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  the specified user's password in a user pool as an administrator.
       Works on any user.

       The password can be temporary or permanent. If  it  is  temporary,  the
       user  status enters the FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD state. When the user next
       tries to sign in, the InitiateAuth/AdminInitiateAuth response will con-
       tain  the  NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED challenge. If the user doesn't sign in
       before it expires, the user won't be able to sign in, and  an  adminis-
       trator must reset their password.

       Once the user has set a new password, or the password is permanent, the
       user status is set to Confirmed .
          AdminSetUserPassword can set a password for the  user  profile  that
          Amazon Cognito creates for third-party federated users. When you set
          a  password,  the  federated  user's  status  changes  from   EXTER-
          NAL_PROVIDER  to  CONFIRMED  . A user in this state can sign in as a
          federated user, and initiate authentication flows in the API like  a
          linked  native  user.  They  can  also modify their password and at-
          tributes in token-authenticated API requests like ChangePassword and
          UpdateUserAttributes . As a best security practice and to keep users
          in sync with your external IdP, don't  set  passwords  on  federated
          user  profiles. To set up a federated user for native sign-in with a
          linked native user, refer to Linking federated users to an  existing
          user profile .

       NOTE:
          Amazon  Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) poli-
          cies in requests for this API operation.  For  this  operation,  you
          must  use  IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant
          yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool where you want to set the  user's
          password.

       --username (string)
          The username of the user that you want to query or modify. The value
          of this parameter is typically your user's username, but it  can  be
          any  of their alias attributes. If username isn't an alias attribute
          in your user pool, you can also use their sub in this request.

       --password (string)
          The password for the user.

       --permanent | --no-permanent (boolean)
          True if the password is permanent, False if it is temporary.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
