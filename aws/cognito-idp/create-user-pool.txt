NAME
       create-user-pool -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  action  might  generate  an SMS text message. Starting June 1,
          2021, US telecom carriers require you  to  register  an  origination
          phone  number  before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers.
          If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register  a
          phone  number  with Amazon Pinpoint . Amazon Cognito uses the regis-
          tered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must
          receive  SMS  messages  might not be able to sign up, activate their
          accounts, or sign in.

          If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or  any
          other  Amazon  Web Service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might
          place your account in the SMS sandbox. In * sandbox mode * , you can
          send  messages  only  to verified phone numbers. After you test your
          app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the  sand-
          box  and into production. For more information, see SMS message set-
          tings for Amazon Cognito user pools in the Amazon Cognito  Developer
          Guide .

       Creates a new Amazon Cognito user pool and sets the password policy for
       the pool.

       WARNING:
          If you don't provide a value for an attribute, Amazon  Cognito  sets
          it to its default value.

       NOTE:
          Amazon  Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) poli-
          cies in requests for this API operation.  For  this  operation,  you
          must  use  IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant
          yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

OPTIONS
       --pool-name (string)
          A string used to name the user pool.

       --policies (structure)
          The policies associated with the new user pool.

          PasswordPolicy -> (structure)
              The password policy.

              MinimumLength -> (integer)
                 The minimum length of the password in  the  policy  that  you
                 have set. This value can't be less than 6.

              RequireUppercase -> (boolean)
                 In  the  password policy that you have set, refers to whether
                 you have required users to use at least one uppercase  letter
                 in their password.

              RequireLowercase -> (boolean)
                 In  the  password policy that you have set, refers to whether
                 you have required users to use at least one lowercase  letter
                 in their password.

              RequireNumbers -> (boolean)
                 In  the  password policy that you have set, refers to whether
                 you have required users to use at least one number  in  their
                 password.

              RequireSymbols -> (boolean)
                 In  the  password policy that you have set, refers to whether
                 you have required users to use at least one symbol  in  their
                 password.

              TemporaryPasswordValidityDays -> (integer)
                 The number of days a temporary password is valid in the pass-
                 word policy. If the user doesn't sign in during this time, an
                 administrator  must  reset their password. Defaults to 7 . If
                 you submit a value of 0 , Amazon Cognito treats it as a  null
                 value  and  sets TemporaryPasswordValidityDays to its default
                 value.

                 NOTE:
                     When you set  TemporaryPasswordValidityDays  for  a  user
                     pool,  you  can  no longer set a value for the legacy Un-
                     usedAccountValidityDays parameter in that user pool.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PasswordPolicy={MinimumLength=integer,RequireUppercase=boolean,RequireLowercase=boolean,RequireNumbers=boolean,RequireSymbols=boolean,TemporaryPasswordValidityDays=integer}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "PasswordPolicy": {
              "MinimumLength": integer,
              "RequireUppercase": true|false,
              "RequireLowercase": true|false,
              "RequireNumbers": true|false,
              "RequireSymbols": true|false,
              "TemporaryPasswordValidityDays": integer
            }
          }

       --deletion-protection (string)
          When active, DeletionProtection prevents accidental deletion of your
          user pool. Before you can delete a user pool that you have protected
          against deletion, you must deactivate this feature.

          When you try to delete a protected user pool in a DeleteUserPool API
          request,  Amazon Cognito returns an InvalidParameterException error.
          To delete a protected user pool, send a new  DeleteUserPool  request
          after  you  deactivate  deletion protection in an UpdateUserPool API
          request.

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o INACTIVE

       --lambda-config (structure)
          The Lambda trigger configuration information for the new user pool.

          NOTE:
              In a push model, event sources (such as Amazon S3 and custom ap-
              plications)  need  permission  to invoke a function. So you must
              make an extra call to add permission for these event sources  to
              invoke your Lambda function.

              For  more information on using the Lambda API to add permission,
              see`AddPermission                                             <-
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_AddPermis-
              sion.html>`__ .

              For adding  permission  using  the  CLI,  see`add-permission  <-
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/add-per-
              mission.html>`__ .

          PreSignUp -> (string)
              A pre-registration Lambda trigger.

              A custom Message Lambda trigger.

          PostConfirmation -> (string)
              A post-confirmation Lambda trigger.

          PreAuthentication -> (string)
              A pre-authentication Lambda trigger.

          PostAuthentication -> (string)
              A post-authentication Lambda trigger.

          DefineAuthChallenge -> (string)
              Defines the authentication challenge.

          CreateAuthChallenge -> (string)
              Creates an authentication challenge.

          VerifyAuthChallengeResponse -> (string)
              Verifies the authentication challenge response.

          PreTokenGeneration -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function that you want  to
              assign to your Lambda trigger.

              Set  this  parameter for legacy purposes. If you also set an ARN
              in PreTokenGenerationConfig , its value  must  be  identical  to
              PreTokenGeneration  .  For new instances of pre token generation
              triggers, set the LambdaArn of PreTokenGenerationConfig .

              You can set

          UserMigration -> (string)
              The user migration Lambda config type.

          PreTokenGenerationConfig -> (structure)
              The detailed configuration of a pre token generation trigger. If
              you  also  set  an ARN in PreTokenGeneration , its value must be
              identical to PreTokenGenerationConfig .

              LambdaVersion -> (string)
                 The user pool trigger version of the request that Amazon Cog-
                 nito  sends to your Lambda function. Higher-numbered versions
                 add fields that support new features.

              LambdaArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function that you  want
                 to assign to your Lambda trigger.

                 This parameter and the PreTokenGeneration property of Lambda-
                 Config have the same value. For new instances  of  pre  token
                 generation triggers, set LambdaArn .

                 nito sends to your Lambda function. Higher-numbered  versions
                 add fields that support new features.

                 You  must  use  a  LambdaVersion of V1_0 with a custom sender
                 function.

              LambdaArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function that you  want

          Possible values:

          o OFF

          o ON

          o OPTIONAL

       --user-attribute-update-settings (structure)
          The  settings for updates to user attributes. These settings include
          the property AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate , a user-pool
          setting that tells Amazon Cognito how to handle changes to the value
          of your users' email address and phone number attributes.  For  more
          information, see Verifying updates to email addresses and phone num-
          bers .

          AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate -> (list)
              Requires that your user verifies their email address, phone num-
              ber, or both before Amazon Cognito updates the value of that at-
              tribute. When you update a user attribute that has  this  option
              activated,  Amazon  Cognito  sends a verification message to the
              new phone number or email address. Amazon Cognito doesnt  change
              the value of the attribute until your user responds to the veri-
              fication message and confirms the new value.

              You can verify an updated email address or phone number  with  a
              VerifyUserAttribute   API   request.   You  can  also  call  the
              AdminUpdateUserAttributes  API   and   set   email_verified   or
              phone_number_verified to true.

              When  AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate  is  false, your
              user pool doesn't  require  that  your  users  verify  attribute
              changes before Amazon Cognito updates them. In a user pool where
              AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate is false,  API  opera-
              tions  that  change  attribute  values  can immediately update a
              users email or phone_number attribute.

       --device-configuration (structure)
          The device-remembering configuration for a user pool. A  null  value
          indicates  that you have deactivated device remembering in your user
          pool.

          NOTE:
              When you provide a value for any DeviceConfiguration field,  you
              activate the Amazon Cognito device-remembering feature.

          ChallengeRequiredOnNewDevice -> (boolean)
              When true, a remembered device can sign in with device authenti-
              cation instead of SMS and time-based  one-time  password  (TOTP)
              factors for multi-factor authentication (MFA).

              NOTE:
                 Whether  or  not  ChallengeRequiredOnNewDevice is true, users
                 who sign in with devices that have not been confirmed or  re-
                 membered  must  still  provide a second factor in a user pool
                 that requires MFA.

          DeviceOnlyRememberedOnUserPrompt -> (boolean)
              When true,  Amazon  Cognito  doesn't  automatically  remember  a
              user's  device  when your app sends a ConfirmDevice API request.
              In your app, create a prompt for your  user  to  choose  whether
              they  want to remember their device. Return the user's choice in
              an UpdateDeviceStatus API request.

              When DeviceOnlyRememberedOnUserPrompt is false , Amazon  Cognito
              immediately  remembers devices that you register in a ConfirmDe-
              vice API request.

       --email-configuration (structure)
          The email configuration of your user pool. The  email  configuration
          type sets your preferred sending method, Amazon Web Services Region,
          and sender for messages from your user pool.

          SourceArn -> (string)
              The ARN of a verified email address or an address from  a  veri-
              fied  domain in Amazon SES. You can set a SourceArn email from a
              verified domain only with an API request. You can set a verified
              email  address,  but not an address in a verified domain, in the
              Amazon Cognito console. Amazon Cognito uses  the  email  address
              that  you provide in one of the following ways, depending on the
              value that you specify for the EmailSendingAccount parameter:

              o If you specify COGNITO_DEFAULT , Amazon Cognito uses this  ad-
                dress as the custom FROM address when it emails your users us-
                ing its built-in email account.

              o If you specify DEVELOPER , Amazon Cognito  emails  your  users
                with this address by calling Amazon SES on your behalf.

              The Region value of the SourceArn parameter must indicate a sup-
              ported Amazon Web Services Region of your user pool.  Typically,
              the  Region  in  the  SourceArn and the user pool Region are the
              same. For more information, see Amazon SES  email  configuration
              regions in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          ReplyToEmailAddress -> (string)
              The destination to which the receiver of the email should reply.

          EmailSendingAccount -> (string)
              Specifies whether Amazon Cognito uses its built-in functionality
              to send your users email messages, or uses  your  Amazon  Simple
              Email  Service email configuration. Specify one of the following
              values:
                 COGNITO_DEFAULT

              When Amazon Cognito emails your  users,  it  uses  its  built-in
              email  functionality.  When  you  use the default option, Amazon
              Cognito allows only a limited number of emails each day for your
              user  pool.  For  typical  production  environments, the default
              email limit is  less  than  the  required  delivery  volume.  To
              achieve  a higher delivery volume, specify DEVELOPER to use your
              Amazon SES email configuration.

              To look up the email delivery limit for the default option,  see
              Limits in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

              The  default FROM address is no-reply@verificationemail.com . To
              customize the FROM address, provide  the  Amazon  Resource  Name
              (ARN)  of an Amazon SES verified email address for the SourceArn
              parameter.
                 DEVELOPER

              When Amazon Cognito emails your users, it uses your  Amazon  SES
              configuration. Amazon Cognito calls Amazon SES on your behalf to
              send email from your verified email address. When you  use  this
              option, the email delivery limits are the same limits that apply
              to your Amazon SES verified email address  in  your  Amazon  Web
              Services account.

              If  you  use this option, provide the ARN of an Amazon SES veri-
              fied email address for the SourceArn parameter.

              Before Amazon Cognito can email your users,  it  requires  addi-
              tional  permissions  to call Amazon SES on your behalf. When you
              update your user pool with this option, Amazon Cognito creates a
              service-linked role , which is a type of role in your Amazon Web
              Services account. This role contains the permissions that  allow
              you to access Amazon SES and send email messages from your email
              address. For more information about the service-linked role that
              Amazon  Cognito creates, see Using Service-Linked Roles for Ama-
              zon Cognito in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          From -> (string)
              Either the senders email address or the senders name with  their
              email  address.  For  example, testuser@example.com or Test User
              <testuser@example.com> . This address appears before the body of
              the email.

          ConfigurationSet -> (string)
              The  set  of  configuration  rules that can be applied to emails
              sent using Amazon Simple Email Service. A configuration  set  is
              applied  to  an email by including a reference to the configura-
              tion set in the headers of the email. Once applied, all  of  the
              rules  in  that configuration set are applied to the email. Con-
              figuration sets can be used to  apply  the  following  types  of
              rules to emails:
                 Event publishing

              Amazon Simple Email Service can track the number of send, deliv-
              ery, open, click, bounce, and complaint events  for  each  email
              sent.  Use  event  publishing  to  send  information about these
              events to other Amazon Web Services services such as and  Amazon
              CloudWatch
                 IP pool management

              When  leasing  dedicated  IP  addresses with Amazon Simple Email
              Service, you can create groups of IP addresses, called dedicated
              IP  pools.  You  can  then associate the dedicated IP pools with
              configuration sets.

       --sms-configuration (structure)
          The SMS configuration with the settings  that  your  Amazon  Cognito
          user  pool must use to send an SMS message from your Amazon Web Ser-
          vices account through Amazon Simple Notification  Service.  To  send
          SMS  messages with Amazon SNS in the Amazon Web Services Region that
          you want, the Amazon Cognito user pool uses an Identity  and  Access
          Management (IAM) role in your Amazon Web Services account.

          SnsCallerArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS caller. This is
              the ARN of the IAM role in your Amazon Web Services account that
              Amazon  Cognito  will use to send SMS messages. SMS messages are
              subject to a spending limit .

          ExternalId -> (string)
              The external ID provides additional security for your IAM  role.
              You  can  use  an ExternalId with the IAM role that you use with
              Amazon SNS to send SMS messages for your user pool. If you  pro-
              vide  an  ExternalId , your Amazon Cognito user pool includes it
              in the request to assume your IAM role. You  can  configure  the
              role  trust policy to require that Amazon Cognito, and any prin-
              cipal, provide the ExternalID . If you use  the  Amazon  Cognito
              Management Console to create a role for SMS multi-factor authen-
              tication (MFA), Amazon Cognito creates a role with the  required
              permissions  and a trust policy that demonstrates use of the Ex-
              ternalId .

              For more information about the ExternalId of a role, see How  to
              use  an external ID when granting access to your Amazon Web Ser-
              vices resources to a third party

          SnsRegion -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services Region to use with Amazon  SNS  integra-
              tion.  You  can  choose  the same Region as your user pool, or a
              supported Legacy Amazon SNS alternate Region .

              Amazon Cognito resources in the Asia Pacific (Seoul) Amazon  Web
              Services  Region  must  use your Amazon SNS configuration in the
              Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Region. For more information, see SMS  mes-
              sage settings for Amazon Cognito user pools .

       --user-pool-tags (map)
          The tag keys and values to assign to the user pool. A tag is a label
          that you can use to categorize and manage user  pools  in  different
          ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.

       --admin-create-user-config (structure)
          The configuration for AdminCreateUser requests.

          AllowAdminCreateUserOnly -> (boolean)
              Set  to True if only the administrator is allowed to create user
              profiles. Set to False if users can sign themselves  up  via  an
              app.

          UnusedAccountValidityDays -> (integer)
              The  user  account  expiration limit, in days, after which a new
              account that hasn't signed in is no longer usable. To reset  the
              account  after  that  time  limit, you must call AdminCreateUser
              again, specifying "RESEND" for the MessageAction parameter.  The
              default value for this parameter is 7.

              NOTE:
                 If you set a value for TemporaryPasswordValidityDays in Pass-
                 wordPolicy , that value will be used, and UnusedAccountValid-
                 ityDays  will be no longer be an available parameter for that
                 user pool.

          InviteMessageTemplate -> (structure)
              The message template to be used for the welcome message  to  new
              users.

              See also Customizing User Invitation Messages .

              SMSMessage -> (string)
                 The message template for SMS messages.

              EmailMessage -> (string)
                 The  message template for email messages. EmailMessage is al-
                 lowed only if EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER.

              EmailSubject -> (string)
                 The subject line for email messages. EmailSubject is  allowed
                 only if EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AllowAdminCreateUserOnly=boolean,UnusedAccountValidityDays=integer,InviteMessageTemplate={SMSMessage=string,EmailMessage=string,EmailSubject=string}

       JSON Syntax:

              "EmailSubject": "string"
            }
          }

       --schema (list)
          An  array  of  schema  attributes  for  the new user pool. These at-
          tributes can be standard or custom attributes.

          (structure)
              A list of the user attributes and their properties in your  user
              pool.  The attribute schema contains standard attributes, custom
              attributes with a custom: prefix, and developer attributes  with
              a dev: prefix. For more information, see User pool attributes .

              Developer-only  attributes  are  a legacy feature of user pools,
              are read-only to all app clients. You can create and update  de-
              veloper-only  attributes  only with IAM-authenticated API opera-
              tions. Use app client read/write permissions instead.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of your user pool attribute. When you create or  up-
                 date  a user pool, adding a schema attribute creates a custom
                 or developer-only attribute. When you add an attribute with a
                 Name value of MyAttribute , Amazon Cognito creates the custom
                 attribute custom:MyAttribute . When DeveloperOnlyAttribute is
                 true  ,  Amazon  Cognito  creates your attribute as dev:MyAt-
                 tribute . In an operation that describes a user pool,  Amazon
                 Cognito  returns this value as value for standard attributes,
                 custom:value for custom attributes, and dev:value for  devel-
                 oper-only attributes..

              AttributeDataType -> (string)
                 The  data  format  of the values for your attribute. When you
                 choose an AttributeDataType , Amazon  Cognito  validates  the
                 input against the data type. A custom attribute value in your
                 user's ID token is always a string, for  example  "custom:is-
                 Member" : "true" or "custom:YearsAsMember" : "12" .

              DeveloperOnlyAttribute -> (boolean)

                 NOTE:
                     You should use WriteAttributes in the user pool client to
                     control how attributes can be mutated for new  use  cases
                     instead of using DeveloperOnlyAttribute .

                 Specifies  whether the attribute type is developer only. This
                 attribute can only be modified  by  an  administrator.  Users
                 won't be able to modify this attribute using their access to-
                 ken. For example, DeveloperOnlyAttribute can be modified  us-
                 ing  AdminUpdateUserAttributes but can't be updated using Up-
                 dateUserAttributes.

              Mutable -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the value of the attribute can be changed.

                 Any user pool attribute whose value you map from an  IdP  at-
                 tribute  must  be  mutable,  with a parameter value of true .
                 Amazon Cognito updates mapped attributes when users  sign  in
                 to  your  application  through an IdP. If an attribute is im-
                 mutable, Amazon Cognito throws an error when it  attempts  to
                 update  the  attribute.  For more information, see Specifying
                 Identity Provider Attribute Mappings for Your User Pool .

              Required -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether a user pool attribute is required.  If  the
                 attribute  is  required and the user doesn't provide a value,
                 registration or sign-in will fail.

              NumberAttributeConstraints -> (structure)
                 Specifies the constraints for  an  attribute  of  the  number
                 type.

                 MinValue -> (string)
                     The  minimum  value of an attribute that is of the number
                     data type.

                 MaxValue -> (string)
                     The maximum value of an attribute that is of  the  number
                     data type.

              StringAttributeConstraints -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the  constraints  for  an  attribute of the string
                 type.

                 MinLength -> (string)
                     The minimum length.

                 MaxLength -> (string)
                     The maximum length.

       --username-configuration (structure)
          Case sensitivity on the username input for the selected sign-in  op-
          tion.  When  case  sensitivity  is  set to False (case insensitive),
          users can sign in with any combination of capital and lowercase let-
          ters. For example, username , USERNAME , or UserName , or for email,
          email@example.com or EMaiL@eXamplE.Com . For  most  use  cases,  set
          case  sensitivity  to  False  (case insensitive) as a best practice.
          When usernames and email addresses are case insensitive, Amazon Cog-
          nito  treats  any variation in case as the same user, and prevents a
          case variation from being assigned to the same attribute for a  dif-
          ferent user.

          This  configuration is immutable after you set it. For more informa-
          tion, see UsernameConfigurationType .

          CaseSensitive -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether user name case sensitivity will be applied for
              all users in the user pool through Amazon Cognito APIs. For most
              use cases, set case sensitivity to False (case insensitive) as a
              best  practice.  When usernames and email addresses are case in-
              sensitive, users can sign in as the same user when they enter  a
              different capitalization of their user name.

              Valid values include:
                 True

              Enables  case  sensitivity for all username input. When this op-
              tion is set to True , users must sign in using the  exact  capi-
              talization  of  their  given username, such as UserName. This is
              the default value.
                 False

              Enables case insensitivity for all username input. For  example,
              when this option is set to False , users can sign in using user-
              name , USERNAME , or UserName . This option  also  enables  both
              preferred_username  and  email  alias to be case insensitive, in
              addition to the username attribute.

       --account-recovery-setting (structure)
          The available verified method a user can use to recover their  pass-
          word when they call ForgotPassword . You can use this setting to de-
          fine a preferred method when a user has more than one method  avail-
          able.  With  this  setting, SMS doesn't qualify for a valid password
          recovery mechanism if the user also has SMS multi-factor authentica-
          tion (MFA) activated. In the absence of this setting, Amazon Cognito
          uses the legacy behavior to determine the recovery method where  SMS
          is preferred through email.

          RecoveryMechanisms -> (list)
              The list of RecoveryOptionTypes .

              (structure)
                 A  map  containing  a  priority as a key, and recovery method
                 name as a value.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     A positive integer specifying priority of a method with 1
                     being the highest priority.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The recovery method for a user.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a minimally configured user pool

       This example creates a user pool named MyUserPool using default values.
       There are no required attributes and no application  clients.  MFA  and
       advanced security is disabled.

       To create a user pool with two required attributes

       This  example creates a user pool MyUserPool. The pool is configured to
       accept email as a username attribute. It also sets the email source ad-
       dress to a validated address using Amazon Simple Email Service.

       Command:

          aws cognito-idp create-user-pool --pool-name MyUserPool --username-attributes "email" --email-configuration=SourceArn="arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:111111111111:identity/jane@example.com",ReplyToEmailAddress="jane@example.com"

          A container for the user pool details.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID of the user pool.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the user pool.

          Policies -> (structure)
              The policies associated with the user pool.

              PasswordPolicy -> (structure)
                 The password policy.

                 MinimumLength -> (integer)
                     The minimum length of the password in the policy that you
                     have set. This value can't be less than 6.

                 RequireUppercase -> (boolean)
                     In the password policy  that  you  have  set,  refers  to
                     whether  you  have required users to use at least one up-
                     percase letter in their password.

                 RequireLowercase -> (boolean)
                     In the password policy  that  you  have  set,  refers  to
                     whether  you have required users to use at least one low-
                     ercase letter in their password.

                 RequireNumbers -> (boolean)
                     In the password policy  that  you  have  set,  refers  to
                     whether  you have required users to use at least one num-
                     ber in their password.

                 RequireSymbols -> (boolean)
                     In the password policy  that  you  have  set,  refers  to
                     whether  you have required users to use at least one sym-
                     bol in their password.

                 TemporaryPasswordValidityDays -> (integer)
                     The number of days a temporary password is valid  in  the
                     password  policy. If the user doesn't sign in during this
                     time, an administrator must  reset  their  password.  De-
                     faults to 7 . If you submit a value of 0 , Amazon Cognito
                     treats it as a null value and  sets  TemporaryPasswordVa-
                     lidityDays to its default value.

                     NOTE:
                        When  you set TemporaryPasswordValidityDays for a user
                        pool, you can no longer set a value for the legacy Un-
                        usedAccountValidityDays parameter in that user pool.

          DeletionProtection -> (string)
              When  active, DeletionProtection prevents accidental deletion of
              your user pool. Before you can delete a user pool that you  have
              protected against deletion, you must deactivate this feature.

              When you try to delete a protected user pool in a DeleteUserPool
              API request, Amazon Cognito returns an InvalidParameterException
              error.  To  delete a protected user pool, send a new DeleteUser-
              Pool request after you deactivate deletion protection in an  Up-
              dateUserPool API request.

          LambdaConfig -> (structure)
              The Lambda triggers associated with the user pool.

              PreSignUp -> (string)
                 A pre-registration Lambda trigger.

              CustomMessage -> (string)
                 A custom Message Lambda trigger.

              PostConfirmation -> (string)
                 A post-confirmation Lambda trigger.

              PreAuthentication -> (string)
                 A pre-authentication Lambda trigger.

              PostAuthentication -> (string)
                 A post-authentication Lambda trigger.

              DefineAuthChallenge -> (string)
                 Defines the authentication challenge.

              CreateAuthChallenge -> (string)
                 Creates an authentication challenge.

              VerifyAuthChallengeResponse -> (string)
                 Verifies the authentication challenge response.

              PreTokenGeneration -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function that you want
                 to assign to your Lambda trigger.

                 Set this parameter for legacy purposes. If you  also  set  an
                 ARN in PreTokenGenerationConfig , its value must be identical
                 to PreTokenGeneration . For new instances of pre token gener-
                 ation triggers, set the LambdaArn of PreTokenGenerationConfig
                 .

                 You can set

              UserMigration -> (string)
                 The user migration Lambda config type.

              PreTokenGenerationConfig -> (structure)
                 The detailed configuration of a pre token generation trigger.
                 If you also set an ARN in PreTokenGeneration , its value must
                 be identical to PreTokenGenerationConfig .

                 LambdaVersion -> (string)
                     The user pool trigger version of the request that  Amazon
                     Cognito  sends  to  your Lambda function. Higher-numbered
                     versions add fields that support new features.

                 LambdaArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function  that  you
                     want to assign to your Lambda trigger.

                     This  parameter  and  the  PreTokenGeneration property of
                     LambdaConfig have the same value. For  new  instances  of
                     pre token generation triggers, set LambdaArn .

              CustomSMSSender -> (structure)
                 A custom SMS sender Lambda trigger.

                 LambdaVersion -> (string)
                     The  user pool trigger version of the request that Amazon
                     Cognito sends to your  Lambda  function.  Higher-numbered
                     versions add fields that support new features.

                     You must use a LambdaVersion of V1_0 with a custom sender
                     function.

                 LambdaArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function  that  you
                     want to assign to your Lambda trigger.

              CustomEmailSender -> (structure)
                 A custom email sender Lambda trigger.

                 LambdaVersion -> (string)
                     The  user pool trigger version of the request that Amazon
                     Cognito sends to your  Lambda  function.  Higher-numbered
                     versions add fields that support new features.

                     You must use a LambdaVersion of V1_0 with a custom sender
                     function.

                 LambdaArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function  that  you
                     want to assign to your Lambda trigger.

              KMSKeyID -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an KMS key . Amazon Cognito
                 uses the key to encrypt codes and temporary passwords sent to
                 CustomEmailSender and CustomSMSSender .

          Status -> (string)
              This parameter is no longer used.

          LastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and time, in ISO 8601 format, when the item was modi-
              fied.

          CreationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time, in ISO 8601 format, when the  item  was  cre-
              ated.

          SchemaAttributes -> (list)
              A  list of the user attributes and their properties in your user
              pool. The attribute schema contains standard attributes,  custom
              attributes  with a custom: prefix, and developer attributes with
              a dev: prefix. For more information, see User pool attributes .

              Developer-only attributes are a legacy feature  of  user  pools,
              are  read-only to all app clients. You can create and update de-
              veloper-only attributes only with IAM-authenticated  API  opera-
              tions. Use app client read/write permissions instead.

              (structure)
                 A  list  of  the user attributes and their properties in your
                 user pool. The attribute schema contains standard attributes,
                 custom  attributes  with  a custom: prefix, and developer at-
                 tributes with a dev: prefix. For more information,  see  User
                 pool attributes .

                 Developer-only attributes are a legacy feature of user pools,
                 are read-only to all app clients. You can create  and  update
                 developer-only attributes only with IAM-authenticated API op-
                 erations. Use app client read/write permissions instead.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of your user pool attribute. When you create  or
                     update  a  user pool, adding a schema attribute creates a
                     custom or developer-only attribute. When you add  an  at-
                     tribute with a Name value of MyAttribute , Amazon Cognito
                     creates the custom attribute  custom:MyAttribute  .  When
                     DeveloperOnlyAttribute  is  true , Amazon Cognito creates
                     your attribute as dev:MyAttribute . In an operation  that
                     describes  a user pool, Amazon Cognito returns this value
                     as value for standard attributes, custom:value for custom
                     attributes, and dev:value for developer-only attributes..

                 AttributeDataType -> (string)
                     The  data  format  of the values for your attribute. When
                     you choose an AttributeDataType ,  Amazon  Cognito  vali-
                     dates the input against the data type. A custom attribute
                     value in your user's ID token is always a string, for ex-
                     ample  "custom:isMember"  : "true" or "custom:YearsAsMem-
                     ber" : "12" .

                 DeveloperOnlyAttribute -> (boolean)

                     NOTE:
                        You should use WriteAttributes in the user pool client
                        to  control  how attributes can be mutated for new use
                        cases instead of using DeveloperOnlyAttribute .

                     Specifies whether the attribute type is  developer  only.
                     This  attribute can only be modified by an administrator.
                     Users won't be able to modify this attribute using  their
                     access  token. For example, DeveloperOnlyAttribute can be
                     modified using AdminUpdateUserAttributes but can't be up-
                     dated using UpdateUserAttributes.

                 Mutable -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  the  value  of  the  attribute can be
                     changed.

                     Any user pool attribute whose value you map from  an  IdP
                     attribute must be mutable, with a parameter value of true
                     . Amazon Cognito updates  mapped  attributes  when  users
                     sign  in to your application through an IdP. If an attri-
                     bute is immutable, Amazon Cognito throws an error when it
                     attempts  to  update the attribute. For more information,
                     see Specifying Identity Provider Attribute  Mappings  for
                     Your User Pool .

                 Required -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  a user pool attribute is required. If
                     the attribute is required and the user doesn't provide  a
                     value, registration or sign-in will fail.

                 NumberAttributeConstraints -> (structure)
                     Specifies  the constraints for an attribute of the number
                     type.

                     MinValue -> (string)
                        The minimum value of an attribute that is of the  num-
                        ber data type.

                     MaxValue -> (string)
                        The  maximum value of an attribute that is of the num-
                        ber data type.

                 StringAttributeConstraints -> (structure)
                     Specifies the constraints for an attribute of the  string
                     type.

                     MinLength -> (string)
                        The minimum length.

                     MaxLength -> (string)
                        The maximum length.

          AutoVerifiedAttributes -> (list)
              The attributes that are auto-verified in a user pool.

              (string)

          AliasAttributes -> (list)
              The attributes that are aliased in a user pool.

              (string)

          UsernameAttributes -> (list)
              Specifies  whether a user can use an email address or phone num-
              ber as a username when they sign up.

              (string)

          SmsVerificationMessage -> (string)
              This     parameter     is     no      longer      used.      See
              VerificationMessageTemplateType .

          EmailVerificationMessage -> (string)
              This      parameter      is      no     longer     used.     See
              VerificationMessageTemplateType .

          EmailVerificationSubject -> (string)
              This     parameter     is     no      longer      used.      See
              VerificationMessageTemplateType .

          VerificationMessageTemplate -> (structure)
              The template for verification messages.

              SmsMessage -> (string)

                 your users.

              EmailMessage -> (string)
                 The template for email messages that Amazon Cognito sends  to
                 your  users. You can set an EmailMessage template only if the
                 value  of  EmailSendingAccount  is  DEVELOPER  .  When   your
                 EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER , your user pool sends email
                 messages with your own Amazon SES configuration.

              EmailSubject -> (string)
                 The subject line for the email message template. You can  set
                 an    EmailSubject    template   only   if   the   value   of
                 EmailSendingAccount    is    DEVELOPER    .     When     your
                 EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER , your user pool sends email
                 messages with your own Amazon SES configuration.

              EmailMessageByLink -> (string)
                 The email message template for sending a confirmation link to
                 the  user. You can set an EmailMessageByLink template only if

                 messages with your own Amazon SES configuration.

              EmailSubjectByLink -> (string)
                 The subject line for the email message template for sending a
                 confirmation  link  to the user. You can set an EmailSubject-
                 ByLink template only if the value of  EmailSendingAccount  is
                 DEVELOPER . When your EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER , your
                 user pool sends email messages with your own Amazon SES  con-
                 figuration.

              DefaultEmailOption -> (string)
                 The default email option.

          SmsAuthenticationMessage -> (string)
              The contents of the SMS authentication message.

          UserAttributeUpdateSettings -> (structure)
              The  settings for updates to user attributes. These settings in-
              clude the property AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate , a
              user-pool  setting  that  tells  Amazon  Cognito  how  to handle
              changes to the value of your users' email address and phone num-
              ber  attributes.  For more information, see Verifying updates to
              email addresses and phone numbers .

              AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate -> (list)
                 Requires that your user verifies their email  address,  phone
                 number,  or  both  before Amazon Cognito updates the value of
                 that attribute. When you update a  user  attribute  that  has
                 this  option  activated,  Amazon Cognito sends a verification
                 message to the new phone number or email address. Amazon Cog-
                 nito doesnt change the value of the attribute until your user
                 responds to the verification message  and  confirms  the  new
                 value.

                 You  can verify an updated email address or phone number with
                 a VerifyUserAttribute API request.  You  can  also  call  the
                 AdminUpdateUserAttributes   API  and  set  email_verified  or
                 phone_number_verified to true.

                 When AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate is false, your
                 user  pool  doesn't  require that your users verify attribute
                 changes before Amazon Cognito updates them. In  a  user  pool
                 where AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate is false, API
                 operations that change attribute values can  immediately  up-
                 date a users email or phone_number attribute.

                 (string)

          MfaConfiguration -> (string)
              Can be one of the following values:

              o OFF - MFA tokens aren't required and can't be specified during
                user registration.

              o ON - MFA tokens are required for all user  registrations.  You
                can  only  specify  required  when you're initially creating a
                user pool.

              o OPTIONAL - Users have the option when registering to create an
                MFA token.

          DeviceConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  device-remembering  configuration  for  a user pool. A null
              value indicates that you have deactivated device remembering  in
              your user pool.

              NOTE:
                 When  you  provide a value for any DeviceConfiguration field,
                 you activate the Amazon Cognito device-remembering feature.

              ChallengeRequiredOnNewDevice -> (boolean)
                 When true, a remembered device can sign in  with  device  au-
                 thentication  instead of SMS and time-based one-time password
                 (TOTP) factors for multi-factor authentication (MFA).

                 NOTE:
                     Whether  or  not  ChallengeRequiredOnNewDevice  is  true,
                     users  who  sign  in with devices that have not been con-
                     firmed or remembered must still provide a  second  factor
                     in a user pool that requires MFA.

              DeviceOnlyRememberedOnUserPrompt -> (boolean)
                 When  true,  Amazon  Cognito doesn't automatically remember a
                 user's device when your app sends  a  ConfirmDevice  API  re-
                 quest.  In  your app, create a prompt for your user to choose
                 whether they want to remember their device. Return the user's
                 choice in an UpdateDeviceStatus API request.

                 When  DeviceOnlyRememberedOnUserPrompt is false , Amazon Cog-
                 nito immediately remembers devices that  you  register  in  a
                 ConfirmDevice API request.

          EstimatedNumberOfUsers -> (integer)
              A number estimating the size of the user pool.

          EmailConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  email configuration of your user pool. The email configura-
              tion type sets your preferred sending method,  Amazon  Web  Ser-
              vices Region, and sender for messages from your user pool.

              SourceArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of a verified email address or an address from a ver-
                 ified domain in Amazon SES. You can  set  a  SourceArn  email
                 from  a verified domain only with an API request. You can set
                 a verified email address, but not an address  in  a  verified
                 domain,  in  the  Amazon Cognito console. Amazon Cognito uses
                 the email address that you provide in one  of  the  following
                 ways,  depending  on  the  value  that  you  specify  for the
                 EmailSendingAccount parameter:

                 o If you specify COGNITO_DEFAULT , Amazon Cognito  uses  this
                   address  as  the  custom  FROM  address when it emails your
                   users using its built-in email account.

                 o If you specify DEVELOPER , Amazon Cognito emails your users
                   with this address by calling Amazon SES on your behalf.

                 The  Region  value of the SourceArn parameter must indicate a
                 supported Amazon Web Services Region of your user pool. Typi-
                 cally,  the  Region in the SourceArn and the user pool Region
                 are the same. For more information, see Amazon SES email con-
                 figuration regions in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

              ReplyToEmailAddress -> (string)
                 The destination to which the receiver of the email should re-
                 ply.

              EmailSendingAccount -> (string)
                 Specifies whether Amazon Cognito uses its built-in  function-
                 ality  to send your users email messages, or uses your Amazon
                 Simple Email Service email configuration. Specify one of  the
                 following values:
                     COGNITO_DEFAULT

                 When  Amazon  Cognito emails your users, it uses its built-in
                 email functionality. When you use the default option,  Amazon
                 Cognito  allows  only a limited number of emails each day for
                 your user pool. For typical production environments, the  de-
                 fault  email limit is less than the required delivery volume.
                 To achieve a higher delivery volume, specify DEVELOPER to use
                 your Amazon SES email configuration.

                 To  look  up the email delivery limit for the default option,
                 see Limits in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

                 The default FROM address is no-reply@verificationemail.com  .
                 To  customize  the  FROM address, provide the Amazon Resource
                 Name (ARN) of an Amazon SES verified email  address  for  the
                 SourceArn parameter.
                     DEVELOPER

                 When  Amazon  Cognito  emails your users, it uses your Amazon
                 SES configuration. Amazon Cognito calls Amazon  SES  on  your
                 behalf  to  send email from your verified email address. When
                 you use this option, the email delivery limits are  the  same
                 limits  that  apply to your Amazon SES verified email address
                 in your Amazon Web Services account.

                 If you use this option, provide the ARN of an Amazon SES ver-
                 ified email address for the SourceArn parameter.

                 Before Amazon Cognito can email your users, it requires addi-
                 tional permissions to call Amazon SES on  your  behalf.  When
                 you  update  your  user pool with this option, Amazon Cognito
                 creates a service-linked role , which is a type  of  role  in
                 your Amazon Web Services account. This role contains the per-
                 missions that allow you to access Amazon SES and  send  email
                 messages  from your email address. For more information about
                 the service-linked role  that  Amazon  Cognito  creates,  see
                 Using  Service-Linked  Roles for Amazon Cognito in the Amazon
                 Cognito Developer Guide .

              From -> (string)
                 Either the senders email address or  the  senders  name  with
                 their  email  address.  For  example, testuser@example.com or
                 Test User <testuser@example.com> . This address  appears  be-
                 fore the body of the email.

              ConfigurationSet -> (string)
                 The  set of configuration rules that can be applied to emails
                 sent using Amazon Simple Email Service. A  configuration  set
                 is  applied  to an email by including a reference to the con-
                 figuration set in the headers of the email. Once applied, all
                 of  the  rules  in  that configuration set are applied to the
                 email. Configuration sets can be used to apply the  following
                 types of rules to emails:
                     Event publishing

                 Amazon Simple Email Service can track the number of send, de-
                 livery, open, click, bounce, and complaint  events  for  each
                 email  sent.  Use  event publishing to send information about
                 these events to other Amazon Web Services  services  such  as
                 and Amazon CloudWatch
                     IP pool management

                 When  leasing dedicated IP addresses with Amazon Simple Email
                 Service, you can create groups of IP addresses, called  dedi-
                 cated IP pools. You can then associate the dedicated IP pools
                 with configuration sets.

          SmsConfiguration -> (structure)
              The SMS configuration with the settings that your Amazon Cognito
              user  pool  must use to send an SMS message from your Amazon Web
              Services account through Amazon Simple Notification Service.  To
              send SMS messages with Amazon SNS in the Amazon Web Services Re-
              gion that you want, the Amazon Cognito user pool uses  an  Iden-
              tity  and  Access  Management (IAM) role in your Amazon Web Ser-
              vices account.

              SnsCallerArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS caller. This
                 is  the  ARN  of the IAM role in your Amazon Web Services ac-
                 count that Amazon Cognito will use to send SMS messages.  SMS
                 messages are subject to a spending limit .

              ExternalId -> (string)
                 The  external  ID  provides  additional security for your IAM
                 role. You can use an ExternalId with the IAM  role  that  you
                 use  with Amazon SNS to send SMS messages for your user pool.
                 If you provide an ExternalId , your Amazon Cognito user  pool
                 includes  it  in the request to assume your IAM role. You can
                 configure the role trust policy to require that  Amazon  Cog-
                 nito,  and any principal, provide the ExternalID . If you use
                 the Amazon Cognito Management Console to create  a  role  for
                 SMS multi-factor authentication (MFA), Amazon Cognito creates
                 a role with the required permissions and a trust policy  that
                 demonstrates use of the ExternalId .

                 For  more information about the ExternalId of a role, see How
                 to use an external ID when granting access to your Amazon Web
                 Services resources to a third party

              SnsRegion -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web Services Region to use with Amazon SNS inte-
                 gration. You can choose the same Region as your user pool, or
                 a supported Legacy Amazon SNS alternate Region .

                 Amazon  Cognito  resources in the Asia Pacific (Seoul) Amazon
                 Web Services Region must use your Amazon SNS configuration in
                 the  Asia  Pacific  (Tokyo) Region. For more information, see
                 SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools .

          UserPoolTags -> (map)
              The tags that are assigned to the user pool. A tag  is  a  label
              that  you  can apply to user pools to categorize and manage them
              in different ways, such as by purpose,  owner,  environment,  or
              other criteria.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          SmsConfigurationFailure -> (string)
              The  reason why the SMS configuration can't send the messages to
              your users.

              This message might include comma-separated  values  to  describe
              why  your SMS configuration can't send messages to user pool end
              users.
                 InvalidSmsRoleAccessPolicyException

              The Identity and Access Management role that Amazon Cognito uses
              to  send SMS messages isn't properly configured. For more infor-
              mation, see SmsConfigurationType .
                 SNSSandbox

              The Amazon Web Services account is in the SNS  SMS  Sandbox  and
              messages will only reach verified end users. This parameter wont
              get populated with SNSSandbox if the user creating the user pool
              doesnt  have  SNS  permissions. To learn how to move your Amazon
              Web Services account out of the sandbox, see Moving out  of  the
              SMS sandbox .

          EmailConfigurationFailure -> (string)
              Deprecated.   Review   error   codes   from  API  requests  with
              EventSource:cognito-idp.amazonaws.com in CloudTrail for informa-
              tion about problems with user pool email configuration.

          Domain -> (string)
              The domain prefix, if the user pool has a domain associated with
              it.

          CustomDomain -> (string)
              A custom domain name that you provide to  Amazon  Cognito.  This
              parameter  applies  only  if you use a custom domain to host the
              sign-up and sign-in pages for your application. An example of  a
              custom domain name might be auth.example.com .

              For  more  information about adding a custom domain to your user
              pool, see Using Your Own Domain for the Hosted UI .

          AdminCreateUserConfig -> (structure)
              The configuration for AdminCreateUser requests.

              AllowAdminCreateUserOnly -> (boolean)
                 Set to True if only the administrator is  allowed  to  create
                 user  profiles.  Set to False if users can sign themselves up
                 via an app.

              UnusedAccountValidityDays -> (integer)
                 The user account expiration limit, in days, after which a new
                 account  that  hasn't signed in is no longer usable. To reset
                 the account after that time limit, you must  call  AdminCrea-
                 teUser  again,  specifying "RESEND" for the MessageAction pa-
                 rameter. The default value for this parameter is 7.

                 NOTE:
                     If you set a value for  TemporaryPasswordValidityDays  in
                     PasswordPolicy  ,  that value will be used, and UnusedAc-
                     countValidityDays will be no longer be an  available  pa-
                     rameter for that user pool.

              InviteMessageTemplate -> (structure)
                 The  message  template  to be used for the welcome message to
                 new users.

                 See also Customizing User Invitation Messages .

                 SMSMessage -> (string)
                     The message template for SMS messages.

                 EmailMessage -> (string)
                     The message template for email messages. EmailMessage  is
                     allowed only if EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER.

                 EmailSubject -> (string)
                     The  subject line for email messages. EmailSubject is al-
                     lowed only if EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER.

          UserPoolAddOns -> (structure)
              User pool add-ons. Contains settings for activation of  advanced
              security  features. To log user security information but take no
              action, set to AUDIT . To configure automatic security responses
              to risky traffic to your user pool, set to ENFORCED .

              For  more  information,  see  Adding advanced security to a user
              pool .

              AdvancedSecurityMode -> (string)
                 The operating mode of advanced security features in your user
                 pool.

          UsernameConfiguration -> (structure)
              Case  sensitivity of the username input for the selected sign-in
              option. For example, when case sensitivity is  set  to  False  ,
              users  can  sign  in using either "username" or "Username". This
              configuration is immutable once it has been set. For more infor-
              mation, see UsernameConfigurationType .

              CaseSensitive -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether user name case sensitivity will be applied
                 for all users in the user pool through Amazon  Cognito  APIs.
                 For  most  use cases, set case sensitivity to False (case in-
                 sensitive) as a best practice. When usernames and  email  ad-
                 dresses  are  case insensitive, users can sign in as the same
                 user when they enter a different capitalization of their user
                 name.

                 Valid values include:
                     True

                 Enables  case  sensitivity  for all username input. When this
                 option is set to True , users must sign in  using  the  exact
                 capitalization  of  their  given  username, such as UserName.
                 This is the default value.
                     False

                 Enables case insensitivity for all username input. For  exam-
                 ple, when this option is set to False , users can sign in us-
                 ing username , USERNAME , or UserName . This option also  en-
                 ables  both preferred_username and email alias to be case in-
                 sensitive, in addition to the username attribute.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the user pool.

          AccountRecoverySetting -> (structure)
              The available verified method a user can use  to  recover  their
              password  when  they call ForgotPassword . You can use this set-
              ting to define a preferred method when a user has more than  one
              method  available.  With this setting, SMS doesn't qualify for a
              valid password recovery mechanism  if  the  user  also  has  SMS
              multi-factor  authentication  (MFA) activated. In the absence of
              this setting, Amazon Cognito uses the legacy behavior to  deter-
              mine the recovery method where SMS is preferred through email.

              RecoveryMechanisms -> (list)
                 The list of RecoveryOptionTypes .

                 (structure)
                     A map containing a priority as a key, and recovery method
                     name as a value.

                     Priority -> (integer)
                        A positive integer specifying  priority  of  a  method
                        with 1 being the highest priority.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The recovery method for a user.
