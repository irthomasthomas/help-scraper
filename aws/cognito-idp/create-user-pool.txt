CREATE-USER-POOL()                                          CREATE-USER-POOL()



NAME
       create-user-pool -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new Amazon Cognito user pool and sets the password policy for
       the pool.

       NOTE:
          This action might generate an SMS text  message.  Starting  June  1,
          2021,  US  telecom  carriers  require you to register an origination
          phone number before you can send SMS messages to US  phone  numbers.
          If  you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a
          phone number with Amazon Pinpoint . Amazon Cognito uses  the  regis-
          tered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must
          receive SMS messages might not be able to sign  up,  activate  their
          accounts, or sign in.

          If  you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any
          other Amazon Web Service, Amazon Simple Notification  Service  might
          place your account in the SMS sandbox. In * sandbox mode * , you can
          send messages only to verified phone numbers. After  you  test  your
          app  while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sand-
          box and into production. For more information, see SMS message  set-
          tings  for Amazon Cognito user pools in the Amazon Cognito Developer
          Guide .

OPTIONS
       --pool-name (string)
          A string used to name the user pool.

       --policies (structure)
          The policies associated with the new user pool.

          PasswordPolicy -> (structure)
              The password policy.

              MinimumLength -> (integer)
                 The minimum length of the password in  the  policy  that  you
                 have set. This value can't be less than 6.

              RequireUppercase -> (boolean)
                 In  the  password policy that you have set, refers to whether
                 you have required users to use at least one uppercase  letter
                 in their password.

              RequireLowercase -> (boolean)
                 In  the  password policy that you have set, refers to whether
                 you have required users to use at least one lowercase  letter
                 in their password.

              RequireNumbers -> (boolean)
                 In  the  password policy that you have set, refers to whether
                 you have required users to use at least one number  in  their
                 password.

              RequireSymbols -> (boolean)
                 In  the  password policy that you have set, refers to whether
                 you have required users to use at least one symbol  in  their
                 password.

              TemporaryPasswordValidityDays -> (integer)
                 The number of days a temporary password is valid in the pass-
                 word policy. If the user doesn't sign in during this time, an
                 administrator must reset their password.

                 NOTE:
                     When  you  set  TemporaryPasswordValidityDays  for a user
                     pool, you can no longer set a value for  the  legacy  Un-
                     usedAccountValidityDays parameter in that user pool.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PasswordPolicy={MinimumLength=integer,RequireUppercase=boolean,RequireLowercase=boolean,RequireNumbers=boolean,RequireSymbols=boolean,TemporaryPasswordValidityDays=integer}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "PasswordPolicy": {
              "MinimumLength": integer,
              "RequireUppercase": true|false,
              "RequireLowercase": true|false,

              "TemporaryPasswordValidityDays": integer
            }
          }

       --lambda-config (structure)
          The Lambda trigger configuration information for the new user pool.

          NOTE:
              In a push model, event sources (such as Amazon S3 and custom ap-
              plications) need permission to invoke a function.  So  you  must
              make  an extra call to add permission for these event sources to
              invoke your Lambda function.

              For more information on using the Lambda API to add  permission,
              see`AddPermission                                             <-
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_AddPermis-
              sion.html>`__ .

              For  adding  permission  using  the  CLI,  see`add-permission <-

          Possible values:

          o OFF

          o ON

          o OPTIONAL

       --user-attribute-update-settings (structure)
          The  settings for updates to user attributes. These settings include
          the property AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate , a user-pool
          setting that tells Amazon Cognito how to handle changes to the value
          of your users' email address and phone number attributes.  For  more
          information,  see  Verifying updates to to email addresses and phone
          numbers .

          AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate -> (list)
              Requires that your user verifies their email address, phone num-
              ber, or both before Amazon Cognito updates the value of that at-
              tribute. When you update a user attribute that has  this  option
              activated,  Amazon  Cognito  sends a verification message to the
              new phone number or email address. Amazon Cognito doesnt  change
              the value of the attribute until your user responds to the veri-
              fication message and confirms the new value.

              You can verify an updated email address or phone number  with  a
              VerifyUserAttribute   API   request.   You  can  also  call  the
              UpdateUserAttributes or AdminUpdateUserAttributes  API  and  set
              email_verified or phone_number_verified to true.

              When  AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate  is  false, your
              user pool doesn't  require  that  your  users  verify  attribute
              changes before Amazon Cognito updates them. In a user pool where
              AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate is false,  API  opera-
              tions  that  change  attribute  values  can immediately update a
              users email or phone_number attribute.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate": ["phone_number"|"email", ...]
          }

       --device-configuration (structure)
          The device configuration.

          ChallengeRequiredOnNewDevice -> (boolean)
              When true, device authentication can replace SMS and  time-based
              one-time password (TOTP) factors for multi-factor authentication
              (MFA).

              NOTE:
                 Users that sign in with devices that have not been  confirmed
                 or  remembered  will  still  have to provide a second factor,
                 whether or not  ChallengeRequiredOnNewDevice  is  true,  when
                 your user pool requires MFA.

          DeviceOnlyRememberedOnUserPrompt -> (boolean)
              When  true,  users  can opt in to remembering their device. Your
              app code must  use  callback  functions  to  return  the  user's
              choice.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ChallengeRequiredOnNewDevice=boolean,DeviceOnlyRememberedOnUserPrompt=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ChallengeRequiredOnNewDevice": true|false,
            "DeviceOnlyRememberedOnUserPrompt": true|false
          }

       --email-configuration (structure)
          The  email  configuration of your user pool. The email configuration
          type sets your preferred sending method, Amazon Web Services Region,
          and sender for messages from your user pool.

          SourceArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  of a verified email address in Amazon SES. Amazon Cog-
              nito uses this email address in one of the following  ways,  de-
              pending  on  the  value that you specify for the EmailSendingAc-
              count parameter:

              o If you specify COGNITO_DEFAULT , Amazon Cognito uses this  ad-
                dress as the custom FROM address when it emails your users us-
                ing its built-in email account.

              o If you specify DEVELOPER , Amazon Cognito  emails  your  users
                with this address by calling Amazon SES on your behalf.

              The Region value of the SourceArn parameter must indicate a sup-
              ported Amazon Web Services Region of your user pool.  Typically,
              the  Region  in  the  SourceArn and the user pool Region are the
              same. For more information, see Amazon SES  email  configuration
              regions in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          ReplyToEmailAddress -> (string)
              The destination to which the receiver of the email should reply.

          EmailSendingAccount -> (string)
              Specifies whether Amazon Cognito uses its built-in functionality
              to send your users email messages, or uses  your  Amazon  Simple
              Email  Service email configuration. Specify one of the following
              values:
                 COGNITO_DEFAULT

              When Amazon Cognito emails your  users,  it  uses  its  built-in
              email  functionality.  When  you  use the default option, Amazon
              Cognito allows only a limited number of emails each day for your
              user  pool.  For  typical  production  environments, the default
              email limit is  less  than  the  required  delivery  volume.  To
              achieve  a higher delivery volume, specify DEVELOPER to use your
              Amazon SES email configuration.

              To look up the email delivery limit for the default option,  see
              Limits in in the Developer Guide .

              The  default FROM address is no-reply@verificationemail.com . To
              customize the FROM address, provide  the  Amazon  Resource  Name
              (ARN)  of an Amazon SES verified email address for the SourceArn
              parameter.
                 DEVELOPER

              When Amazon Cognito emails your users, it uses your  Amazon  SES
              configuration. Amazon Cognito calls Amazon SES on your behalf to
              send email from your verified email address. When you  use  this
              option, the email delivery limits are the same limits that apply
              to your Amazon SES verified email address  in  your  Amazon  Web
              Services account.

              If  you  use this option, provide the ARN of an Amazon SES veri-
              fied email address for the SourceArn parameter.

              Before Amazon Cognito can email your users,  it  requires  addi-
              tional  permissions  to call Amazon SES on your behalf. When you
              update your user pool with this option, Amazon Cognito creates a
              service-linked  role  ,  which is a type of role, in your Amazon
              Web Services account. This role contains  the  permissions  that
              allow to access Amazon SES and send email messages with your ad-
              dress. For more information about the service-linked  role  that
              Amazon  Cognito creates, see Using Service-Linked Roles for Ama-
              zon Cognito in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          From -> (string)
              Either the senders email address or the senders name with  their
              email  address.  For  example, testuser@example.com or Test User
              <testuser@example.com> . This address appears before the body of
              the email.

          ConfigurationSet -> (string)
              The  set  of  configuration  rules that can be applied to emails
              sent using Amazon Simple Email Service. A configuration  set  is
              applied  to  an email by including a reference to the configura-
              tion set in the headers of the email. Once applied, all  of  the
              rules  in  that configuration set are applied to the email. Con-
              figuration sets can be used to  apply  the  following  types  of
              rules to emails:
                 Event publishing

              Amazon Simple Email Service can track the number of send, deliv-
              ery, open, click, bounce, and complaint events  for  each  email
              sent.  Use  event  publishing  to  send  information about these
              events to other Amazon Web Services services such as and  Amazon
              CloudWatch
                 IP pool management

              When  leasing  dedicated  IP  addresses with Amazon Simple Email
              Service, you can create groups of IP addresses, called dedicated
              IP  pools.  You  can  then associate the dedicated IP pools with
              configuration sets.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          }

       --sms-configuration (structure)
          The SMS configuration with the settings  that  your  Amazon  Cognito
          user  pool must use to send an SMS message from your Amazon Web Ser-
          vices account through Amazon Simple Notification  Service.  To  send
          SMS  messages with Amazon SNS in the Amazon Web Services Region that
          you want, the Amazon Cognito user pool uses an Identity  and  Access
          Management (IAM) role in your Amazon Web Services account.

          SnsCallerArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS caller. This is
              the ARN of the IAM role in your Amazon Web Services account that
              Amazon  Cognito  will use to send SMS messages. SMS messages are
              subject to a spending limit .

          ExternalId -> (string)
              The external ID provides additional security for your IAM  role.
              You  can  use  an ExternalId with the IAM role that you use with
              Amazon SNS to send SMS messages for your user pool. If you  pro-
              vide  an  ExternalId , your Amazon Cognito user pool includes it
              in the request to assume your IAM role. You  can  configure  the
              role  trust policy to require that Amazon Cognito, and any prin-
              cipal, provide the ExternalID . If you use  the  Amazon  Cognito
              Management Console to create a role for SMS multi-factor authen-
              tication (MFA), Amazon Cognito creates a role with the  required
              permissions  and a trust policy that demonstrates use of the Ex-
              ternalId .

              For more information about the ExternalId of a role, see How  to
              use  an external ID when granting access to your Amazon Web Ser-
              vices resources to a third party

          SnsRegion -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services Region to use with Amazon  SNS  integra-
              tion.  You  can  choose  the same Region as your user pool, or a
              supported Legacy Amazon SNS alternate Region .

              Amazon Cognito resources in the Asia Pacific (Seoul) Amazon  Web
              Services  Region  must  use your Amazon SNS configuration in the
              Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Region. For more information, see SMS  mes-
              sage settings for Amazon Cognito user pools .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          }

       --user-pool-tags (map)
          The tag keys and values to assign to the user pool. A tag is a label
          that you can use to categorize and manage user  pools  in  different
          ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.

       --admin-create-user-config (structure)
          The configuration for AdminCreateUser requests.

          AllowAdminCreateUserOnly -> (boolean)
              Set  to True if only the administrator is allowed to create user
              profiles. Set to False if users can sign themselves  up  via  an
              app.

          UnusedAccountValidityDays -> (integer)
              The  user  account  expiration limit, in days, after which a new
              account that hasn't signed in is no longer usable. To reset  the
              account  after  that  time  limit, you must call AdminCreateUser
              again, specifying "RESEND" for the MessageAction parameter.  The
              default value for this parameter is 7.

              NOTE:
                 If you set a value for TemporaryPasswordValidityDays in Pass-
                 wordPolicy , that value will be used, and UnusedAccountValid-
                 ityDays  will be no longer be an available parameter for that
                 user pool.

          InviteMessageTemplate -> (structure)
              The message template to be used for the welcome message  to  new
              users.

              See also Customizing User Invitation Messages .

              SMSMessage -> (string)
                 The message template for SMS messages.

              EmailMessage -> (string)
                 The  message template for email messages. EmailMessage is al-
                 lowed only if EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER.

              EmailSubject -> (string)
                 The subject line for email messages. EmailSubject is  allowed
                 only if EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AllowAdminCreateUserOnly=boolean,UnusedAccountValidityDays=integer,InviteMessageTemplate={SMSMessage=string,EmailMessage=string,EmailSubject=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AllowAdminCreateUserOnly": true|false,

              "EmailSubject": "string"
            }
          }

       --schema (list)
          An  array  of  schema  attributes  for  the new user pool. These at-
          tributes can be standard or custom attributes.

          (structure)
              Contains information about the schema attribute.

              Name -> (string)
                 A schema attribute of the name type.

              AttributeDataType -> (string)
                 The attribute data type.

              DeveloperOnlyAttribute -> (boolean)

                 NOTE:
                     You should use WriteAttributes in the user pool client to
                     control  how  attributes can be mutated for new use cases
                     instead of using DeveloperOnlyAttribute .

                 Specifies whether the attribute type is developer only.  This
                 attribute  can  only  be  modified by an administrator. Users
                 won't be able to modify this attribute using their access to-
                 ken.  For example, DeveloperOnlyAttribute can be modified us-
                 ing AdminUpdateUserAttributes but can't be updated using  Up-
                 dateUserAttributes.

              Mutable -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the value of the attribute can be changed.

                 For  any  user pool attribute that is mapped to an IdP attri-
                 bute, you must set this parameter to true  .  Amazon  Cognito
                 updates mapped attributes when users sign in to your applica-
                 tion through an IdP. If an  attribute  is  immutable,  Amazon
                 Cognito throws an error when it attempts to update the attri-
                 bute. For more information, see Specifying Identity  Provider
                 Attribute Mappings for Your User Pool .

              Required -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  a user pool attribute is required. If the
                 attribute is required and the user doesn't provide  a  value,
                 registration or sign-in will fail.

              NumberAttributeConstraints -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the  constraints  for  an  attribute of the number
                 type.

                 MinValue -> (string)
                     The minimum value of an attribute that is of  the  number
                     data type.

                 MaxValue -> (string)
                     The  maximum  value of an attribute that is of the number
                     data type.

              StringAttributeConstraints -> (structure)
                 Specifies the constraints for  an  attribute  of  the  string
                 type.

                 MinLength -> (string)
                     The minimum length.

                 MaxLength -> (string)
                     The maximum length.

          rityMode to the value "AUDIT".

          AdvancedSecurityMode -> (string)
              The advanced security mode.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AdvancedSecurityMode=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AdvancedSecurityMode": "OFF"|"AUDIT"|"ENFORCED"
          }

       --username-configuration (structure)
          Case sensitivity on the username input for the selected sign-in  op-
          tion. For example, when case sensitivity is set to False , users can
          sign in using either "username" or "Username". This configuration is
          immutable   once   it  has  been  set.  For  more  information,  see
          UsernameConfigurationType .

          CaseSensitive -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether user name case sensitivity will be applied for
              all users in the user pool through Amazon Cognito APIs.

              Valid values include:
                 True

              Enables  case  sensitivity for all username input. When this op-
              tion is set to True , users must sign in using the  exact  capi-
              talization  of  their  given username, such as UserName. This is
              the default value.
                 False

              Enables case insensitivity for all username input. For  example,
              when  this  option is set to False , users can sign in using ei-
              ther "username" or "Username". This  option  also  enables  both
              preferred_username  and  email  alias to be case insensitive, in
              addition to the username attribute.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CaseSensitive=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CaseSensitive": true|false
          }

       --account-recovery-setting (structure)
          The available verified method a user can use to recover their  pass-
          word when they call ForgotPassword . You can use this setting to de-
          fine a preferred method when a user has more than one method  avail-
          able.  With  this  setting, SMS doesn't qualify for a valid password
          recovery mechanism if the user also has SMS multi-factor authentica-
          tion (MFA) activated. In the absence of this setting, Amazon Cognito
          uses the legacy behavior to determine the recovery method where  SMS
          is preferred through email.

          RecoveryMechanisms -> (list)
              The list of RecoveryOptionTypes .

              (structure)
                 A  map  containing  a  priority as a key, and recovery method
                 name as a value.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     A positive integer specifying priority of a method with 1
                     being the highest priority.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The recovery method for a user.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RecoveryMechanisms=[{Priority=integer,Name=string},{Priority=integer,Name=string}]

              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a minimally configured user pool

       This example creates a user pool named MyUserPool using default values.
       There are no required attributes and no application  clients.  MFA  and
       advanced security is disabled.

       To create a user pool with two required attributes

       This  example creates a user pool MyUserPool. The pool is configured to
       accept email as a username attribute. It also sets the email source ad-
       dress to a validated address using Amazon Simple Email Service.

       Command:

          aws cognito-idp create-user-pool --pool-name MyUserPool --username-attributes "email" --email-configuration=SourceArn="arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:111111111111:identity/jane@example.com",ReplyToEmailAddress="jane@example.com"

                     Specifies whether the attribute type is  developer  only.
                     This  attribute can only be modified by an administrator.
                     Users won't be able to modify this attribute using  their
                     access  token. For example, DeveloperOnlyAttribute can be
                     modified using AdminUpdateUserAttributes but can't be up-
                     dated using UpdateUserAttributes.

                 Mutable -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  the  value  of  the  attribute can be
                     changed.

                     For any user pool attribute that is mapped to an IdP  at-
                     tribute,  you  must  set  this parameter to true . Amazon
                     Cognito updates mapped attributes when users sign  in  to
                     your  application  through an IdP. If an attribute is im-
                     mutable, Amazon Cognito throws an error when it  attempts
                     to  update  the  attribute.  For  more  information,  see
                     Specifying Identity Provider Attribute Mappings for  Your
                     User Pool .

                 Required -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  a user pool attribute is required. If
                     the attribute is required and the user doesn't provide  a
                     value, registration or sign-in will fail.

                 NumberAttributeConstraints -> (structure)
                     Specifies  the constraints for an attribute of the number
                     type.

                     MinValue -> (string)
                        The minimum value of an attribute that is of the  num-
                        ber data type.

                     MaxValue -> (string)
                        The  maximum value of an attribute that is of the num-
                        ber data type.

                 StringAttributeConstraints -> (structure)
                     Specifies the constraints for an attribute of the  string
                     type.

                     MinLength -> (string)
                        The minimum length.

                     MaxLength -> (string)
                        The maximum length.

          AutoVerifiedAttributes -> (list)

                 your users.

              EmailMessage -> (string)
                 The  template for email messages that Amazon Cognito sends to
                 your users. You can set an EmailMessage template only if  the
                 value   of  EmailSendingAccount  is  DEVELOPER  .  When  your
                 EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER , your user pool sends email
                 messages with your own Amazon SES configuration.

              EmailSubject -> (string)
                 The  subject line for the email message template. You can set
                 an   EmailSubject   template   only   if   the    value    of
                 EmailSendingAccount     is     DEVELOPER    .    When    your
                 EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER , your user pool sends email
                 messages with your own Amazon SES configuration.

              EmailMessageByLink -> (string)
                 The email message template for sending a confirmation link to
                 the user. You can set an EmailMessageByLink template only  if
                 the  value  of  EmailSendingAccount  is DEVELOPER . When your
                 EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER , your user pool sends email
                 messages with your own Amazon SES configuration.

              EmailSubjectByLink -> (string)
                 The subject line for the email message template for sending a
                 confirmation link to the user. You can set  an  EmailSubject-
                 ByLink  template  only if the value of EmailSendingAccount is
                 DEVELOPER . When your EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER , your
                 user  pool sends email messages with your own Amazon SES con-
                 figuration.

              DefaultEmailOption -> (string)
                 The default email option.

          SmsAuthenticationMessage -> (string)
              The contents of the SMS authentication message.

          UserAttributeUpdateSettings -> (structure)
              The settings for updates to user attributes. These settings  in-
              clude the property AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate , a
              user-pool setting  that  tells  Amazon  Cognito  how  to  handle
              changes to the value of your users' email address and phone num-
              ber attributes. For more information, see Verifying  updates  to
              to email addresses and phone numbers .

              AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate -> (list)
                 Requires  that  your user verifies their email address, phone
                 number, or both before Amazon Cognito updates  the  value  of
                 that  attribute.  When  you  update a user attribute that has
                 this option activated, Amazon Cognito  sends  a  verification
                 message to the new phone number or email address. Amazon Cog-
                 nito doesnt change the value of the attribute until your user
                 responds  to  the  verification  message and confirms the new
                 value.

                 You can verify an updated email address or phone number  with
                 a  VerifyUserAttribute  API  request.  You  can also call the
                 UpdateUserAttributes or AdminUpdateUserAttributes API and set
                 email_verified or phone_number_verified to true.

                 When AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate is false, your
                 user pool doesn't require that your  users  verify  attribute
                 changes  before  Amazon  Cognito updates them. In a user pool
                 where AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate is false, API
                 operations  that  change attribute values can immediately up-
                 date a users email or phone_number attribute.

                 (string)

          MfaConfiguration -> (string)
              Can be one of the following values:

              o OFF - MFA tokens aren't required and can't be specified during
                user registration.

              o ON  -  MFA tokens are required for all user registrations. You
                can only specify required when  you're  initially  creating  a
                user pool.

              o OPTIONAL - Users have the option when registering to create an
                MFA token.

          DeviceConfiguration -> (structure)
              The device configuration.

              ChallengeRequiredOnNewDevice -> (boolean)
                 When  true,  device  authentication  can  replace   SMS   and
                 time-based  one-time password (TOTP) factors for multi-factor
                 authentication (MFA).

                 NOTE:
                     Users that sign in with devices that have not  been  con-
                     firmed  or remembered will still have to provide a second
                     factor, whether or  not  ChallengeRequiredOnNewDevice  is
                     true, when your user pool requires MFA.

              DeviceOnlyRememberedOnUserPrompt -> (boolean)
                 When true, users can opt in to remembering their device. Your
                 app code must use callback functions  to  return  the  user's
                 choice.

          EstimatedNumberOfUsers -> (integer)
              A number estimating the size of the user pool.

          EmailConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  email configuration of your user pool. The email configura-
              tion type sets your preferred sending method,  Amazon  Web  Ser-
              vices Region, and sender for messages tfrom your user pool.

              SourceArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  a  verified email address in Amazon SES. Amazon
                 Cognito uses this email address in one of the following ways,
                 depending  on the value that you specify for the EmailSendin-
                 gAccount parameter:

                 o If you specify COGNITO_DEFAULT , Amazon Cognito  uses  this
                   address  as  the  custom  FROM  address when it emails your
                   users using its built-in email account.

                 o If you specify DEVELOPER , Amazon Cognito emails your users
                   with this address by calling Amazon SES on your behalf.

                 The  Region  value of the SourceArn parameter must indicate a
                 supported Amazon Web Services Region of your user pool. Typi-
                 cally,  the  Region in the SourceArn and the user pool Region
                 are the same. For more information, see Amazon SES email con-
                 figuration regions in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

              ReplyToEmailAddress -> (string)
                 The destination to which the receiver of the email should re-
                 ply.

              EmailSendingAccount -> (string)
                 Specifies whether Amazon Cognito uses its built-in  function-
                 ality  to send your users email messages, or uses your Amazon
                 Simple Email Service email configuration. Specify one of  the
                 following values:
                     COGNITO_DEFAULT

                 When  Amazon  Cognito emails your users, it uses its built-in
                 email functionality. When you use the default option,  Amazon
                 Cognito  allows  only a limited number of emails each day for
                 your user pool. For typical production environments, the  de-
                 fault  email limit is less than the required delivery volume.
                 To achieve a higher delivery volume, specify DEVELOPER to use
                 your Amazon SES email configuration.

                 To  look  up the email delivery limit for the default option,
                 see Limits in in the Developer Guide .

                 The default FROM address is no-reply@verificationemail.com  .
                 To  customize  the  FROM address, provide the Amazon Resource
                 Name (ARN) of an Amazon SES verified email  address  for  the
                 SourceArn parameter.
                     DEVELOPER

                 When  Amazon  Cognito  emails your users, it uses your Amazon
                 SES configuration. Amazon Cognito calls Amazon  SES  on  your
                 behalf  to  send email from your verified email address. When
                 you use this option, the email delivery limits are  the  same
                 limits  that  apply to your Amazon SES verified email address
                 in your Amazon Web Services account.

                 If you use this option, provide the ARN of an Amazon SES ver-
                 ified email address for the SourceArn parameter.

                 Before Amazon Cognito can email your users, it requires addi-
                 tional permissions to call Amazon SES on  your  behalf.  When
                 you  update  your  user pool with this option, Amazon Cognito
                 creates a service-linked role , which is a type of  role,  in
                 your Amazon Web Services account. This role contains the per-
                 missions that allow to access Amazon SES and send email  mes-
                 sages  with your address. For more information about the ser-
                 vice-linked role that Amazon Cognito creates, see Using  Ser-
                 vice-Linked  Roles  for  Amazon Cognito in the Amazon Cognito
                 Developer Guide .

              From -> (string)
                 Either the senders email address or  the  senders  name  with
                 their  email  address.  For  example, testuser@example.com or
                 Test User <testuser@example.com> . This address  appears  be-
                 fore the body of the email.

              ConfigurationSet -> (string)
                 The  set of configuration rules that can be applied to emails
                 sent using Amazon Simple Email Service. A  configuration  set
                 is  applied  to an email by including a reference to the con-
                 figuration set in the headers of the email. Once applied, all
                 of  the  rules  in  that configuration set are applied to the
                 email. Configuration sets can be used to apply the  following
                 types of rules to emails:
                     Event publishing

                 Amazon Simple Email Service can track the number of send, de-
                 livery, open, click, bounce, and complaint  events  for  each
                 email  sent.  Use  event publishing to send information about
                 these events to other Amazon Web Services  services  such  as
                 and Amazon CloudWatch
                     IP pool management

                 When  leasing dedicated IP addresses with Amazon Simple Email
                 Service, you can create groups of IP addresses, called  dedi-
                 cated IP pools. You can then associate the dedicated IP pools
                 with configuration sets.

          SmsConfiguration -> (structure)
              The SMS configuration with the settings that your Amazon Cognito
              user  pool  must use to send an SMS message from your Amazon Web
              Services account through Amazon Simple Notification Service.  To
              send SMS messages with Amazon SNS in the Amazon Web Services Re-
              gion that you want, the Amazon Cognito user pool uses  an  Iden-
              tity  and  Access  Management (IAM) role in your Amazon Web Ser-
              vices account.

              SnsCallerArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS caller. This
                 is  the  ARN  of the IAM role in your Amazon Web Services ac-
                 count that Amazon Cognito will use to send SMS messages.  SMS
                 messages are subject to a spending limit .

              ExternalId -> (string)
                 The  external  ID  provides  additional security for your IAM
                 role. You can use an ExternalId with the IAM  role  that  you
                 use  with Amazon SNS to send SMS messages for your user pool.
                 If you provide an ExternalId , your Amazon Cognito user  pool
                 includes  it  in the request to assume your IAM role. You can
                 configure the role trust policy to require that  Amazon  Cog-
                 nito,  and any principal, provide the ExternalID . If you use
                 the Amazon Cognito Management Console to create  a  role  for
                 SMS multi-factor authentication (MFA), Amazon Cognito creates
                 a role with the required permissions and a trust policy  that
                 demonstrates use of the ExternalId .

                 For  more information about the ExternalId of a role, see How
                 to use an external ID when granting access to your Amazon Web
                 Services resources to a third party

              SnsRegion -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web Services Region to use with Amazon SNS inte-
                 gration. You can choose the same Region as your user pool, or
                 a supported Legacy Amazon SNS alternate Region .

                 Amazon  Cognito  resources in the Asia Pacific (Seoul) Amazon
                 Web Services Region must use your Amazon SNS configuration in
                 the  Asia  Pacific  (Tokyo) Region. For more information, see
                 SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools .

          UserPoolTags -> (map)
              The tags that are assigned to the user pool. A tag  is  a  label
              that  you  can apply to user pools to categorize and manage them
              in different ways, such as by purpose,  owner,  environment,  or
              other criteria.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          SmsConfigurationFailure -> (string)
              The  reason why the SMS configuration can't send the messages to
              your users.

              This message might include comma-separated  values  to  describe
              why  your SMS configuration can't send messages to user pool end
              users.
                 InvalidSmsRoleAccessPolicyException

              The Identity and Access Management role that Amazon Cognito uses
              to  send SMS messages isn't properly configured. For more infor-
              mation, see SmsConfigurationType .
                 SNSSandbox

              The Amazon Web Services account is in the SNS  SMS  Sandbox  and
              messages will only reach verified end users. This parameter wont
              get populated with SNSSandbox if the IAM user creating the  user
              pool doesnt have SNS permissions. To learn how to move your Ama-
              zon Web Services account out of the sandbox, see Moving  out  of
              the SMS sandbox .

          EmailConfigurationFailure -> (string)
              Deprecated.   Review   error   codes   from  API  requests  with
              EventSource:cognito-idp.amazonaws.com in CloudTrail for informa-
              tion about problems with user pool email configuration.

          Domain -> (string)
              The domain prefix, if the user pool has a domain associated with
              it.

          CustomDomain -> (string)
              A custom domain name that you provide to  Amazon  Cognito.  This
              parameter  applies  only  if you use a custom domain to host the
              sign-up and sign-in pages for your application. An example of  a
              custom domain name might be auth.example.com .

              For  more  information about adding a custom domain to your user
              pool, see Using Your Own Domain for the Hosted UI .

          AdminCreateUserConfig -> (structure)
              The configuration for AdminCreateUser requests.

              AllowAdminCreateUserOnly -> (boolean)
                 Set to True if only the administrator is  allowed  to  create
                 user  profiles.  Set to False if users can sign themselves up
                 via an app.

              UnusedAccountValidityDays -> (integer)
                 The user account expiration limit, in days, after which a new
                 account  that  hasn't signed in is no longer usable. To reset
                 the account after that time limit, you must  call  AdminCrea-
                 teUser  again,  specifying "RESEND" for the MessageAction pa-
                 rameter. The default value for this parameter is 7.

                 NOTE:
                     If you set a value for  TemporaryPasswordValidityDays  in
                     PasswordPolicy  ,  that value will be used, and UnusedAc-
                     countValidityDays will be no longer be an  available  pa-
                     rameter for that user pool.

              InviteMessageTemplate -> (structure)
                 The  message  template  to be used for the welcome message to
                 new users.

                 SMSMessage -> (string)
                     The message template for SMS messages.

                 EmailMessage -> (string)
                     The message template for email messages. EmailMessage  is
                     allowed only if EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER.

                 EmailSubject -> (string)
                     The  subject line for email messages. EmailSubject is al-
                     lowed only if EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER.

          UserPoolAddOns -> (structure)
              The user pool add-ons.

              AdvancedSecurityMode -> (string)
                 The advanced security mode.

          UsernameConfiguration -> (structure)
              Case sensitivity of the username input for the selected  sign-in
              option.  For  example,  when  case sensitivity is set to False ,
              users can sign in using either "username"  or  "Username".  This
              configuration is immutable once it has been set. For more infor-
              mation, see UsernameConfigurationType .

              CaseSensitive -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether user name case sensitivity will be  applied
                 for all users in the user pool through Amazon Cognito APIs.

                 Valid values include:
                     True

                 Enables  case  sensitivity  for all username input. When this
                 option is set to True , users must sign in  using  the  exact
                 capitalization  of  their  given  username, such as UserName.
                 This is the default value.
                     False

                 Enables case insensitivity for all username input. For  exam-
                 ple, when this option is set to False , users can sign in us-
                 ing either "username" or "Username". This option also enables
                 both  preferred_username  and email alias to be case insensi-
                 tive, in addition to the username attribute.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the user pool.

          AccountRecoverySetting -> (structure)
              The available verified method a user can use  to  recover  their
              password  when  they call ForgotPassword . You can use this set-
              ting to define a preferred method when a user has more than  one
              method  available.  With this setting, SMS doesn't qualify for a
              valid password recovery mechanism  if  the  user  also  has  SMS
              multi-factor  authentication  (MFA) activated. In the absence of
              this setting, Amazon Cognito uses the legacy behavior to  deter-
              mine the recovery method where SMS is preferred through email.

              RecoveryMechanisms -> (list)
                 The list of RecoveryOptionTypes .

                 (structure)
                     A map containing a priority as a key, and recovery method
                     name as a value.

                     Priority -> (integer)
                        A positive integer specifying  priority  of  a  method
                        with 1 being the highest priority.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The recovery method for a user.
