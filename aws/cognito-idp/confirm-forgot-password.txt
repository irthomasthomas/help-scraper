OPTIONS
       --client-id (string)
          The app client ID of the app associated with the user pool.

       --secret-hash (string)
          A keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) calculated using the
          secret  key of a user pool client and username plus the client ID in
          the message.

       --username (string)
          The user name of the user for whom you want to enter a code  to  re-
          trieve a forgotten password.

       --confirmation-code (string)
          The confirmation code sent by a user's request to retrieve a forgot-
          ten password. For more information, see ForgotPassword .

       --password (string)
          The password sent by a user's request to retrieve a forgotten  pass-
          word.

       --analytics-metadata (structure)
          The  Amazon  Pinpoint  analytics metadata for collecting metrics for
          ConfirmForgotPassword calls.

          AnalyticsEndpointId -> (string)
              The endpoint ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AnalyticsEndpointId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AnalyticsEndpointId": "string"
          }

       --user-context-data (structure)
          Contextual data about your user session, such as the device  finger-
          print,  IP  address,  or  location. Amazon Cognito advanced security
          evaluates the risk of an authentication event based on  the  context
          that  your  app generates and passes to Amazon Cognito when it makes
          API requests.

          IpAddress -> (string)
              The source IP address of your user's device.

          EncodedData -> (string)
              Encoded device-fingerprint details that your app collected  with
              the Amazon Cognito context data collection library. For more in-
              formation, see Adding user device and session data  to  API  re-
              quests .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          IpAddress=string,EncodedData=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "IpAddress": "string",
            "EncodedData": "string"
          }

       --client-metadata (map)
          A  map  of  custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for
          any custom workflows that this action triggers.

          You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda  functions  to  user
          pool  triggers.  When  you use the ConfirmForgotPassword API action,
          Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is  assigned  to  the  post
          confirmation  trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it
          passes a JSON payload, which the function receives  as  input.  This
          payload contains a clientMetadata attribute, which provides the data
          that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in  your  Confirm-
          ForgotPassword  request.  In  your  function code in Lambda, you can
          process the clientMetadata value to enhance your workflow  for  your
          specific needs.

          For  more  information,  see  Customizing  user  pool Workflows with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              When you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that  Amazon
              Cognito won't do the following:

              o Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to
                Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user  pool  to  support
                custom  workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't in-
                clude triggers, the ClientMetadata parameter  serves  no  pur-
                pose.

              o Validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Encrypt  the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito to
                provide sensitive information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
