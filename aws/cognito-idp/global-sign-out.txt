GLOBAL-SIGN-OUT()                                            GLOBAL-SIGN-OUT()



NAME
       global-sign-out -

DESCRIPTION
       Invalidates  the  identity, access, and refresh tokens that Amazon Cog-
       nito issued to a user. Call this operation when your user signs out  of
       your app. This results in the following behavior.

       o Amazon  Cognito  no  longer  accepts token-authorized user operations
         that you authorize with a signed-out user's access tokens.  For  more
         information,  see  Using  the  Amazon Cognito user pools API and user
         pool endpoints . Amazon Cognito returns an Access Token has been  re-
         voked  error when your app attempts to authorize a user pools API re-
         quest with a revoked access token that contains  the  scope  aws.cog-
         nito.signin.user.admin .

       o Amazon  Cognito  no  longer accepts a signed-out user's ID token in a
         GetId request to an identity pool with  ServerSideTokenCheck  enabled
         for its user pool IdP configuration in CognitoIdentityProvider .

       o Amazon  Cognito  no longer accepts a signed-out user's refresh tokens
         in refresh requests.

       Other requests might be valid until your user's token expires.

       Authorize this action with a signed-in user's access token. It must in-
       clude the scope aws.cognito.signin.user.admin .

       NOTE:
          Amazon Cognito doesn't evaluate Identity and Access Management (IAM)
          policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you
          can't use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you can't grant
          IAM permissions in policies. For more information  about  authoriza-
          tion  models  in  Amazon  Cognito, see Using the Amazon Cognito user
          pools API and user pool endpoints .

OPTIONS
       --access-token (string)
          A valid access token that Amazon Cognito issued to the user who  you
          want to sign out.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
