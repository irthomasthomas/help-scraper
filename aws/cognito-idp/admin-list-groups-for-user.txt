       admin-list-groups-for-user is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: Groups

OPTIONS
       --username (string)
          The username of the user that you want to query or modify. The value
          of this parameter is typically your user's username, but it  can  be
          any  of their alias attributes. If username isn't an alias attribute
          in your user pool, this value must be the sub of a local user or the
          username of a user from a third-party IdP.

       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list groups for a user

       This example lists groups for username jane@example.com.

       Command:

          aws cognito-idp admin-list-groups-for-user --user-pool-id us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa --username diego@example.com

       Output:

          {
            "Groups": [
                {
                    "Description": "Sample group",
                    "Precedence": 1,
                    "LastModifiedDate": 1548097827.125,
                    "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/SampleRole",
                    "GroupName": "SampleGroup",
                    "UserPoolId": "us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa",
                    "CreationDate": 1548097827.125
                }
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Groups -> (list)
          The groups that the user belongs to.

          (structure)
              The group type.

              GroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the group.

              UserPoolId -> (string)
                 The user pool ID for the user pool.

              Description -> (string)
                 A string containing the description of the group.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the group.

              Precedence -> (integer)
                 A non-negative integer value that specifies the precedence of
                 this  group  relative to the other groups that a user can be-
                 long to in the user pool.  Zero  is  the  highest  precedence
                 value.  Groups  with  lower Precedence values take precedence
                 over groups with higher ornull Precedence values. If  a  user
                 belongs  to two or more groups, it is the group with the low-
                 est precedence value whose role ARN is given  in  the  user's
                 tokens   for  the  cognito:roles  and  cognito:preferred_role
                 claims.

                 Two groups can have the same Precedence value. If  this  hap-
                 pens,  neither  group takes precedence over the other. If two
                 groups with the same Precedence have the same role ARN,  that
                 role  is  used  in the cognito:preferred_role claim in tokens
                 for users in each group. If the  two  groups  have  different
                 role  ARNs,  the  cognito:preferred_role  claim  isn't set in
                 users' tokens.

                 The default Precedence value is null.

              LastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the item was modified. Amazon  Cognito
                 returns  this  timestamp  in UNIX epoch time format. Your SDK
                 might render the output in a human-readable format  like  ISO
                 8601 or a Java Date object.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and time when the item was created. Amazon Cognito
                 returns this timestamp in UNIX epoch time  format.  Your  SDK
                 might  render  the output in a human-readable format like ISO
                 8601 or a Java Date object.

       NextToken -> (string)
          An identifier that was returned from the previous call to this oper-
          ation,  which  can  be  used  to return the next set of items in the
          list.
