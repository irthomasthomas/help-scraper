DESCRIPTION
       When  given the ID of a user pool app client, returns detailed informa-
       tion about the style assigned to the app client.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-managed-login-branding-by-client uses  document  type  values.
       Document  types  follow  the  JSON  data  model where valid values are:
       strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, and objects. For command  in-
       put, options and nested parameters that are labeled with the type docu-
       ment must be provided as JSON. Shorthand syntax does not support  docu-
       ment types.

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The  ID of the user pool that contains the app client where you want
          more information about the managed login branding style.

       --client-id (string)
          The app client that's assigned to the branding style that  you  want
          more information about.

       --return-merged-resources | --no-return-merged-resources (boolean)
          When  true  , returns values for branding options that are unchanged
          from Amazon Cognito defaults. When false or when you omit  this  pa-
          rameter,  returns  only  values that you customized in your branding
          style.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ManagedLoginBranding -> (structure)
          The details of the requested branding style.

          ManagedLoginBrandingId -> (string)
              The ID of the managed login branding style.

          UserPoolId -> (string)
              The user pool where the branding style is assigned.

          UseCognitoProvidedValues -> (boolean)
              When true, applies the default branding style options. This  op-
              tion reverts to a "blank" style that you can modify later in the
              branding designer.

          Settings -> (document)
              A JSON file, encoded as a Document type, with the  the  settings
              that you want to apply to your style.

          Assets -> (list)
              An  array  of  image  files that you want to apply to roles like
              backgrounds, logos, and icons. Each object  must  also  indicate
              whether  it  is  for  dark mode, light mode, or browser-adaptive
              mode.

              (structure)
                 An image file from a managed login branding style in  a  user
                 pool.

                 This    data    type    is    a    request    parameter    of
                 CreateManagedLoginBranding and  UpdateManagedLoginBranding  ,
                 and a response parameter of DescribeManagedLoginBranding .

                 Category -> (string)
                     The  category  that the image corresponds to in your man-
                     aged login configuration. Managed login has  asset  cate-
                     gories  for  different  types  of logos, backgrounds, and
                     icons.

                 ColorMode -> (string)
                     The display-mode target of the  asset:  light,  dark,  or
                     browser-adaptive.  For example, Amazon Cognito displays a
                     dark-mode image only when the browser or  application  is
                     in dark mode, but displays a browser-adaptive file in all
                     contexts.

                 Extension -> (string)
                     The file type of the image file.

                 Bytes -> (blob)
                     The image file, in Base64-encoded binary.

                 ResourceId -> (string)
                     The ID of the asset.

          CreationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the item was created. Amazon Cognito  re-
              turns  this  timestamp in UNIX epoch time format. Your SDK might
              render the output in a human-readable format like ISO 8601 or  a
              Java Date object.

          LastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the item was modified. Amazon Cognito re-
              turns this timestamp in UNIX epoch time format. Your  SDK  might
              render  the output in a human-readable format like ISO 8601 or a
              Java Date object.
