OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       SmsMfaConfiguration -> (structure)
          Shows user pool SMS message configuration for MFA. Includes the mes-
          sage template and the SMS message sending configuration  for  Amazon
          SNS.

          SmsAuthenticationMessage -> (string)
              The  SMS  authentication message that will be sent to users with
              the code they must sign in with. The message  must  contain  the
              {####} placeholder. Your user pool replaces the placeholder with
              the MFA code. If this parameter isn't provided, your  user  pool
              sends a default message.

          SmsConfiguration -> (structure)
              User pool configuration for delivery of SMS messages with Amazon
              Simple Notification Service. To send SMS  messages  with  Amazon
              SNS  in the Amazon Web Services Region that you want, the Amazon
              Cognito user pool uses an Identity and Access  Management  (IAM)
              role in your Amazon Web Services account.

              You  can  set SmsConfiguration in CreateUserPool and UpdateUser-
              Pool , or in SetUserPoolMfaConfig .

              SnsCallerArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS caller. This
                 is  the  ARN  of the IAM role in your Amazon Web Services ac-
                 count that Amazon Cognito will use to send SMS messages.  SMS
                 messages are subject to a spending limit .

              ExternalId -> (string)
                 The  external  ID  provides  additional security for your IAM
                 role. You can use an ExternalId with the IAM  role  that  you
                 use  with Amazon SNS to send SMS messages for your user pool.
                 If you provide an ExternalId , your Amazon Cognito user  pool
                 includes  it  in the request to assume your IAM role. You can
                 configure the role trust policy to require that  Amazon  Cog-
                 nito,  and any principal, provide the ExternalID . If you use
                 the Amazon Cognito Management Console to create  a  role  for
                 SMS multi-factor authentication (MFA), Amazon Cognito creates
                 a role with the required permissions and a trust policy  that
                 demonstrates use of the ExternalId .

                 For  more information about the ExternalId of a role, see How
                 to use an external ID when granting access to your Amazon Web
                 Services resources to a third party .

              SnsRegion -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web Services Region to use with Amazon SNS inte-
                 gration. You can choose the same Region as your user pool, or
                 a supported Legacy Amazon SNS alternate Region .

                 Amazon  Cognito  resources in the Asia Pacific (Seoul) Amazon
                 Web Services Region must use your Amazon SNS configuration in
                 the  Asia  Pacific  (Tokyo) Region. For more information, see
                 SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools .

       SoftwareTokenMfaConfiguration -> (structure)
          Shows user  pool  configuration  for  time-based  one-time  password
          (TOTP) MFA. Includes TOTP enabled or disabled state.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              The activation state of TOTP MFA.

       EmailMfaConfiguration -> (structure)
          Shows  user  pool  email message configuration for MFA. Includes the
          subject and body of the email message template for MFA messages.  To
          activate  this setting, advanced security features must be active in
          your user pool.

          Message -> (string)
              The template for the email message that your user pool sends  to
              users  with  an  MFA  code.  The message must contain the {####}
              placeholder. In the message, Amazon Cognito replaces this place-
              holder  with the code. If you don't provide this parameter, Ama-
              zon Cognito sends messages in the default format.

          Subject -> (string)
              The subject of the email message that your user  pool  sends  to
              users with an MFA code.

       MfaConfiguration -> (string)
          The  multi-factor  authentication  (MFA) configuration. Valid values
          include:

          o OFF MFA won't be used for any users.

          o ON MFA is required for all users to sign in.

          o OPTIONAL MFA will be required only for individual users  who  have
            an MFA factor activated.

       WebAuthnConfiguration -> (structure)
          Shows  user  pool configuration for MFA with passkeys from biometric
          devices and security keys.

          RelyingPartyId -> (string)
              Sets or displays the authentication domain, typically your  user
              pool  domain, that passkey providers must use as a relying party
              (RP) in their configuration.

              Under the following conditions, the  passkey  relying  party  ID
              must be the fully-qualified domain name of your custom domain:

              o The user pool is configured for passkey authentication.

              o The  user pool has a custom domain, whether or not it also has
                a prefix domain.

              o Your application performs authentication with managed login or
                the classic hosted UI.

          UserVerification -> (string)
              Sets  or  displays  your  user-pool  treatment  for  MFA  with a
              passkey. You can override other MFA options and require  passkey
              MFA,  or  you  can set it as preferred. When passkey MFA is pre-
              ferred, the hosted UI encourages users to register a passkey  at
              sign-in.
