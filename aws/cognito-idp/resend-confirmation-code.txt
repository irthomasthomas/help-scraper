RESEND-CONFIRMATION-CODE()                          RESEND-CONFIRMATION-CODE()



NAME
       resend-confirmation-code -

DESCRIPTION
       Resends  the  confirmation (for confirmation of registration) to a spe-
       cific user in the user pool.

       NOTE:
          Amazon Cognito doesn't evaluate Identity and Access Management (IAM)
          policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you
          can't use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you can't grant
          IAM  permissions  in policies. For more information about authoriza-
          tion models in Amazon Cognito, see Using  the  Amazon  Cognito  user
          pools API and user pool endpoints .

       NOTE:
          This  action  might  generate  an SMS text message. Starting June 1,
          2021, US telecom carriers require you  to  register  an  origination
          phone  number  before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers.
          If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register  a
          phone  number  with Amazon Pinpoint . Amazon Cognito uses the regis-
          tered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must
          receive  SMS  messages  might not be able to sign up, activate their
          accounts, or sign in.

          If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or  any
          other Amazon Web Servicesservice, Amazon Simple Notification Service
          might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In * sandbox mode  *  ,
          you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test
          your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out  of  the
          sandbox  and  into production. For more information, see SMS message
          settings for Amazon Cognito user pools in the Amazon Cognito  Devel-
          oper Guide .

OPTIONS
       --client-id (string)
          The ID of the client associated with the user pool.

       --secret-hash (string)
          A keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) calculated using the
          secret key of a user pool client and username plus the client ID  in
          the message.

       --user-context-data (structure)
          Contextual  data about your user session, such as the device finger-
          print, IP address, or location.  Amazon  Cognito  advanced  security
          evaluates  the  risk of an authentication event based on the context
          that your app generates and passes to Amazon Cognito when  it  makes
          API requests.

          IpAddress -> (string)
              The source IP address of your user's device.

          EncodedData -> (string)
              Encoded  device-fingerprint details that your app collected with
              the Amazon Cognito context data collection library. For more in-
              formation,  see  Adding  user device and session data to API re-
              quests .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          IpAddress=string,EncodedData=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "IpAddress": "string",
            "EncodedData": "string"
          }

       --username (string)
          The username of the user that you want to query or modify. The value
          of  this  parameter is typically your user's username, but it can be
          any of their alias attributes. If username isn't an alias  attribute
          in your user pool, this value must be the sub of a local user or the
          username of a user from a third-party IdP.

       --analytics-metadata (structure)
          The Amazon Pinpoint analytics metadata that contributes to your met-
          rics for ResendConfirmationCode calls.

          AnalyticsEndpointId -> (string)
              The endpoint ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AnalyticsEndpointId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AnalyticsEndpointId": "string"
          }

       --client-metadata (map)
          A  map  of  custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for
          any custom workflows that this action triggers.

          You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda  functions  to  user
          pool  triggers.  When you use the ResendConfirmationCode API action,
          Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to  the  custom
          message  trigger.  When  Amazon  Cognito  invokes  this function, it
          passes a JSON payload, which the function receives  as  input.  This
          payload contains a clientMetadata attribute, which provides the data
          that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your ResendCon-
          firmationCode  request.  In  your  function  code in Lambda, you can
          process the clientMetadata value to enhance your workflow  for  your
          specific needs.

          For  more  information,  see  Customizing  user  pool Workflows with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              When you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that  Amazon
              Cognito won't do the following:

              o Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to
                Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user  pool  to  support
                custom  workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't in-
                clude triggers, the ClientMetadata parameter  serves  no  pur-
                pose.

              o Validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Encrypt  the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito to
                provide sensitive information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following resend-confirmation-code  example  sends  a  confirmation
       code to the user jane.
