NAME
       set-risk-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Configures  actions on detected risks. To delete the risk configuration
       for UserPoolId or ClientId , pass null values for all  four  configura-
       tion types.

       To  activate Amazon Cognito advanced security features, update the user
       pool to include the UserPoolAddOns key``AdvancedSecurityMode`` .

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID.

       --client-id (string)
          The app client ID. If ClientId is null, then the risk  configuration
          is  mapped to userPoolId . When the client ID is null, the same risk
          configuration is applied to all the clients in the userPool.

          Otherwise, ClientId is mapped to the  client.  When  the  client  ID
          isn't  null,  the user pool configuration is overridden and the risk
          configuration for the client is used instead.

       --compromised-credentials-risk-configuration (structure)
          The compromised credentials risk configuration.

          EventFilter -> (list)
              Settings for the sign-in activity where you  want  to  configure
              compromised-credentials actions. Defaults to all events.

              (string)

          Actions -> (structure)
              Settings  for  the  actions that you want your user pool to take
              when Amazon Cognito detects compromised credentials.

              EventAction -> (string)
                 The action that Amazon Cognito takes when it detects  compro-
                 mised credentials.

              thentication.  When  you  choose  to  notify  users  in Account-
              TakeoverRiskConfiguration , Amazon Cognito sends an  email  mes-

                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the identity that is asso-
                 ciated with the sending authorization policy.  This  identity

              LowAction -> (structure)
                 The action that you assign to a low-risk  assessment  by  ad-
                 vanced security features.

                 Notify -> (boolean)
                     Determines  whether Amazon Cognito sends a user a notifi-
                     cation message when your user  pools  assesses  a  user's
                     session at the associated risk level.

                 EventAction -> (string)
                     The action to take for the attempted account takeover ac-
                     tion for the associated risk level. Valid values  are  as
                     follows:

                     o BLOCK : Block the request.

                     o MFA_IF_CONFIGURED  : Present an MFA challenge if possi-
                       ble. MFA is possible if the user pool  has  active  MFA
                       methods  that  the user can set up. For example, if the
                       user pool only supports SMS message MFA  but  the  user
                       doesn't  have a phone number attribute, MFA setup isn't
                       possible. If MFA setup isn't possible,  allow  the  re-
                       quest.

                     o MFA_REQUIRED  :  Present  an MFA challenge if possible.
                       Block the request if a user hasn't set up MFA. To  sign
                       in  with required MFA, users must have an email address
                       or phone number attribute, or a registered TOTP factor.

                     o NO_ACTION : Take no action. Permit sign-in.

              MediumAction -> (structure)
                 The action that you assign to a medium-risk assessment by ad-
                 vanced security features.

                 Notify -> (boolean)
                     Determines  whether Amazon Cognito sends a user a notifi-
                     cation message when your user  pools  assesses  a  user's
                     session at the associated risk level.

                 EventAction -> (string)
                     The action to take for the attempted account takeover ac-
                     tion for the associated risk level. Valid values  are  as
                     follows:

                     o BLOCK : Block the request.

                     o MFA_IF_CONFIGURED  : Present an MFA challenge if possi-
                       ble. MFA is possible if the user pool  has  active  MFA
                       methods  that  the user can set up. For example, if the
                       user pool only supports SMS message MFA  but  the  user
                       doesn't  have a phone number attribute, MFA setup isn't
                       possible. If MFA setup isn't possible,  allow  the  re-
                       quest.

                     o MFA_REQUIRED  :  Present  an MFA challenge if possible.
                       Block the request if a user hasn't set up MFA. To  sign
                       in  with required MFA, users must have an email address
                       or phone number attribute, or a registered TOTP factor.

              HighAction -> (structure)
                 The action that you assign to a high-risk assessment  by  ad-

                     The action to take for the attempted account takeover ac-
                     tion for the associated risk level. Valid values  are  as

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To set risk configuration

       This  example  sets the risk configuration for a user pool. It sets the
       sign-up event action to NO_ACTION.

       Command:

          aws cognito-idp set-risk-configuration --user-pool-id us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa  --compromised-credentials-risk-configuration EventFilter=SIGN_UP,Actions={EventAction=NO_ACTION}

       Output:

          {
            "RiskConfiguration": {
                "UserPoolId": "us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa",

                    "EventFilter": [
                        "SIGN_UP"

                        o BLOCK : Block the request.

                          sible.  MFA  is possible if the user pool has active
                          MFA methods that the user can set up.  For  example,
                          if  the  user pool only supports SMS message MFA but
                          the user doesn't have a phone number attribute,  MFA

                          address  or  phone number attribute, or a registered
                          TOTP factor.

                        Determines whether Amazon Cognito sends a user a noti-

                          MFA  methods  that the user can set up. For example,
                          if the user pool only supports SMS message  MFA  but
                          the  user doesn't have a phone number attribute, MFA
                          setup isn't possible. If MFA setup  isn't  possible,
                          allow the request.
