NAME
       set-risk-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Configures  actions on detected risks. To delete the risk configuration
       for UserPoolId or ClientId , pass null values for all  four  configura-
       tion types.

       To  activate Amazon Cognito advanced security features, update the user
       pool to include the UserPoolAddOns key``AdvancedSecurityMode`` .

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID.

       --client-id (string)
          The app client ID. If ClientId is null, then the risk  configuration
          is  mapped to userPoolId . When the client ID is null, the same risk
          configuration is applied to all the clients in the userPool.

          Otherwise, ClientId is mapped to the  client.  When  the  client  ID
          isn't  null,  the user pool configuration is overridden and the risk
          configuration for the client is used instead.

       --compromised-credentials-risk-configuration (structure)
          The compromised credentials risk configuration.

          EventFilter -> (list)
              Perform the action for these events. The default is  to  perform
              all events if no event filter is specified.

              (string)

          Actions -> (structure)
              The compromised credentials risk configuration actions.

              EventAction -> (string)

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
