LIST-DEVICES()                                                  LIST-DEVICES()



NAME
       list-devices -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  sign-in  devices  that Amazon Cognito has registered to the
       current user. For more information  about  device  authentication,  see
       Working with user devices in your user pool .

       Authorize this action with a signed-in user's access token. It must in-
       clude the scope aws.cognito.signin.user.admin .

       NOTE:
          Amazon Cognito doesn't evaluate Identity and Access Management (IAM)
          policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you
          can't use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you can't grant
          IAM  permissions  in policies. For more information about authoriza-
          tion models in Amazon Cognito, see Using  the  Amazon  Cognito  user
          pools API and user pool endpoints .

OPTIONS
       --access-token (string)
          A  valid  access  token that Amazon Cognito issued to the user whose
          list of devices you want to view.

       --limit (integer)
          The limit of the device request.

       --pagination-token (string)
          This API operation returns a limited number of results. The  pagina-
          tion  token  is  an identifier that you can present in an additional
          API request with the same parameters. When you include  the  pagina-
          tion  token,  Amazon Cognito returns the next set of items after the
          current list. Subsequent requests return a new pagination token.  By
          use of this token, you can paginate through the full list of items.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Devices -> (list)
          The devices returned in the list devices response.

          (structure)
              The device type.

              DeviceKey -> (string)
                 The device key.

              DeviceAttributes -> (list)
                 The device attributes.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies whether the attribute is standard or custom.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the attribute.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the attribute.

              DeviceCreateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The creation date of the device.

              DeviceLastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the item was modified. Amazon  Cognito
                 returns  this  timestamp  in UNIX epoch time format. Your SDK
                 might render the output in a human-readable format  like  ISO
                 8601 or a Java Date object.

              DeviceLastAuthenticatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date when the device was last authenticated.

       PaginationToken -> (string)
          The  identifier  that  Amazon Cognito returned with the previous re-
          quest to this operation. When you include a pagination token in your
          request,  Amazon  Cognito returns the next set of items in the list.
          By use of this token, you can paginate  through  the  full  list  of
          items.
