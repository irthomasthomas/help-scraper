RESPOND-TO-AUTH-CHALLENGE()                        RESPOND-TO-AUTH-CHALLENGE()



NAME
       respond-to-auth-challenge -

DESCRIPTION
       Responds to the authentication challenge.

       NOTE:
          This  action  might  generate  an SMS text message. Starting June 1,
          2021, US telecom carriers require you  to  register  an  origination
          phone  number  before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers.
          If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register  a
          phone  number  with Amazon Pinpoint . Amazon Cognito uses the regis-
          tered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must
          receive  SMS  messages  might not be able to sign up, activate their
          accounts, or sign in.

          If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or  any
          other  Amazon  Web Service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might
          place your account in the SMS sandbox. In * sandbox mode * , you can
          send  messages  only  to verified phone numbers. After you test your
          app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the  sand-
          box  and into production. For more information, see SMS message set-
          tings for Amazon Cognito user pools in the Amazon Cognito  Developer
          Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            respond-to-auth-challenge
          --client-id <value>
          --challenge-name <value>
          [--session <value>]
          [--challenge-responses <value>]
          [--analytics-metadata <value>]
          [--user-context-data <value>]
          [--client-metadata <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-id (string)
          The app client ID.

       --challenge-name (string)
          The challenge name. For more information, see InitiateAuth .
              ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH isn't a valid value.

          Possible values:

          o SMS_MFA

          o SOFTWARE_TOKEN_MFA

          o SELECT_MFA_TYPE

          o MFA_SETUP

          o PASSWORD_VERIFIER

          o CUSTOM_CHALLENGE

          o DEVICE_SRP_AUTH

          o DEVICE_PASSWORD_VERIFIER

          o ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH

          o NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED

       --session (string)
          The  session  that  should be passed both ways in challenge-response
          calls to the service. If InitiateAuth or RespondToAuthChallenge  API
          call  determines  that  the caller must pass another challenge, they
          return a session  with  other  challenge  parameters.  This  session
          should  be  passed  as  it is to the next RespondToAuthChallenge API
          call.

       --challenge-responses (map)
          The challenge responses. These are inputs corresponding to the value
          of ChallengeName , for example:

          NOTE:
              SECRET_HASH (if app client is configured with client secret) ap-
              plies to all of the inputs that follow  (including  SOFTWARE_TO-
              KEN_MFA ).

          o SMS_MFA : SMS_MFA_CODE , USERNAME .

          o PASSWORD_VERIFIER  : PASSWORD_CLAIM_SIGNATURE , PASSWORD_CLAIM_SE-
            CRET_BLOCK , TIMESTAMP , USERNAME .

          NOTE:
              PASSWORD_VERIFIER requires DEVICE_KEY when you sign  in  with  a
              remembered device.

          o NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED  : NEW_PASSWORD , USERNAME , SECRET_HASH (if
            app client is configured with client secret). To set any  required
            attributes  that  Amazon Cognito returned as requiredAttributes in
            the InitiateAuth response, add a
            ``
            userAttributes.*attributename* `` parameter.  This  parameter  can
            also  set  values  for writable attributes that aren't required by
            your user pool.

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 154)
            Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          NOTE:
              In a NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED challenge response, you can't  modify
              a  required  attribute that already has a value. In RespondToAu-
              thChallenge , set a value for any keys that Amazon  Cognito  re-
              turned  in  the requiredAttributes parameter, then use the Upda-
              teUserAttributes API operation to modify the value of any  addi-
              tional attributes.

          o SOFTWARE_TOKEN_MFA  : USERNAME and SOFTWARE_TOKEN_MFA_CODE are re-
            quired attributes.

          o DEVICE_SRP_AUTH requires USERNAME , DEVICE_KEY ,  SRP_A  (and  SE-
            CRET_HASH ).

          o DEVICE_PASSWORD_VERIFIER  requires  everything that PASSWORD_VERI-
            FIER requires, plus DEVICE_KEY .

          o MFA_SETUP requires USERNAME , plus you must use the session  value
            returned by VerifySoftwareToken in the Session parameter.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --analytics-metadata (structure)
          The Amazon Pinpoint analytics metadata that contributes to your met-
          rics for RespondToAuthChallenge calls.

          AnalyticsEndpointId -> (string)
              The endpoint ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AnalyticsEndpointId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AnalyticsEndpointId": "string"
          }

       --user-context-data (structure)
          Contextual data such as the user's device fingerprint,  IP  address,
          or  location  used for evaluating the risk of an unexpected event by
          Amazon Cognito advanced security.

          EncodedData -> (string)
              Contextual data, such as the user's device fingerprint,  IP  ad-
              dress,  or  location,  used  for evaluating the risk of an unex-
              pected event by Amazon Cognito advanced security.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EncodedData=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "EncodedData": "string"
          }

       --client-metadata (map)
          A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide  as  input  for
          any custom workflows that this action triggers.

          You  create  custom  workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user
          pool triggers. When you use the RespondToAuthChallenge  API  action,
          Amazon  Cognito  invokes any functions that are assigned to the fol-
          lowing triggers: post authentication , pre token generation , define
          auth challenge , create auth challenge , and verify auth challenge .
          When Amazon Cognito invokes any of these functions, it passes a JSON
          payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains
          a clientMetadata attribute, which provides the  data  that  you  as-
          signed  to  the  ClientMetadata parameter in your RespondToAuthChal-
          lenge request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process  the
          clientMetadata  value  to  enhance  your  workflow for your specific
          needs.

          For more information,  see  Customizing  user  pool  Workflows  with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              When  you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that Amazon
              Cognito won't do the following:

              o Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to
                Lambda  triggers  that  are assigned to a user pool to support
                custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't  in-
                clude  triggers,  the  ClientMetadata parameter serves no pur-
                pose.

              o Validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Encrypt the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito  to
                provide sensitive information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
