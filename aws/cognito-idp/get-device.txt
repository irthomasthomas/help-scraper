OPTIONS
       --device-key (string)
          The device key.

       --access-token (string)
          A valid access token that Amazon Cognito issued to  the  user  whose
          device information you want to request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Device -> (structure)
          The device.

          DeviceKey -> (string)
              The      device     key,     for     example     us-west-2_EXAM-
              PLE-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222 .

          DeviceAttributes -> (list)
              Metadata about a user's device, like name and last-access source
              IP.

              (structure)
                 The name and value of a user attribute.

                 This    data    type    is    a    request    parameter    of
                 AdminUpdateUserAttributes and UpdateUserAttributes .

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the attribute.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the attribute.

          DeviceCreateDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the item was created. Amazon Cognito  re-
              turns  this  timestamp in UNIX epoch time format. Your SDK might
              render the output in a human-readable format like ISO 8601 or  a
              Java Date object.

          DeviceLastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the item was modified. Amazon Cognito re-
              turns this timestamp in UNIX epoch time format. Your  SDK  might
              render  the output in a human-readable format like ISO 8601 or a
              Java Date object.

          DeviceLastAuthenticatedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date when the user last signed in with the device.
