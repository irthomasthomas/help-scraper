OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)
          The name of the group.

       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool.

       --description (string)
          A string containing the new description of the group.

       --role-arn (string)
          The new role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the group. This is  used
          for  setting  the cognito:roles and cognito:preferred_role claims in
          the token.

       --precedence (integer)
          The new precedence value for the group. For more  information  about
          this parameter, see CreateGroup .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a group

       This example updates the description and precedence for MyGroup.

       Command:

          aws cognito-idp update-group --user-pool-id us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa --group-name MyGroup --description "New description" --precedence 2

       Output:

          {
            "Group": {
                "GroupName": "MyGroup",
                "UserPoolId": "us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa",
                "Description": "New description",
                "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/MyRole",
                "Precedence": 2,
                "LastModifiedDate": 1548800862.812,
                "CreationDate": 1548097827.125
            }
          }

OUTPUT
       Group -> (structure)
          The group object for the group.

          GroupName -> (string)
              The name of the group.

          UserPoolId -> (string)
              The user pool ID for the user pool.

          Description -> (string)
              A string containing the description of the group.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the group.

          Precedence -> (integer)
              A non-negative integer value that specifies  the  precedence  of
              this  group  relative to the other groups that a user can belong
              to in the user pool.  Zero  is  the  highest  precedence  value.
              Groups  with lower Precedence values take precedence over groups
              with higher ornull Precedence values. If a user belongs  to  two
              or more groups, it is the group with the lowest precedence value
              whose role ARN is given  in  the  user's  tokens  for  the  cog-
              nito:roles and cognito:preferred_role claims.

              Two  groups can have the same Precedence value. If this happens,
              neither group takes precedence over the  other.  If  two  groups
              with  the  same  Precedence have the same role ARN, that role is
              used in the cognito:preferred_role claim in tokens for users  in
              each group. If the two groups have different role ARNs, the cog-
              nito:preferred_role claim isn't set in users' tokens.

              The default Precedence value is null.

          LastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the item was modified. Amazon Cognito re-
              turns  this  timestamp in UNIX epoch time format. Your SDK might
              render the output in a human-readable format like ISO 8601 or  a
              Java Date object.

          CreationDate -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time when the item was created. Amazon Cognito re-
              turns this timestamp in UNIX epoch time format. Your  SDK  might
              render  the output in a human-readable format like ISO 8601 or a
              Java Date object.
