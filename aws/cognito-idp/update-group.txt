       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-group
          --group-name <value>
          --user-pool-id <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--role-arn <value>]
          [--precedence <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)
          The name of the group.

       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool.

       --description (string)
          A string containing the new description of the group.

       --role-arn (string)
          The  new role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the group. This is used
          for setting the cognito:roles and cognito:preferred_role  claims  in
          the token.

       --precedence (integer)
          The  new  precedence value for the group. For more information about
          this parameter, see CreateGroup .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a group

       This example updates the description and precedence for MyGroup.

       Command:

          aws cognito-idp update-group --user-pool-id us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa --group-name MyGroup --description "New description" --precedence 2

       Output:

          {
            "Group": {
                "GroupName": "MyGroup",
                "UserPoolId": "us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa",
                "Description": "New description",
                "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/MyRole",
                "Precedence": 2,
                "LastModifiedDate": 1548800862.812,
                "CreationDate": 1548097827.125
            }
          }

OUTPUT
       Group -> (structure)
          The group object for the group.

          GroupName -> (string)
              The name of the group.

          UserPoolId -> (string)
              The user pool ID for the user pool.

          Description -> (string)
              A string containing the description of the group.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the group.

          Precedence -> (integer)
              A non-negative integer value that specifies  the  precedence  of
              this  group  relative to the other groups that a user can belong
              to in the user pool.  Zero  is  the  highest  precedence  value.
              Groups  with lower Precedence values take precedence over groups
              with higher ornull Precedence values. If a user belongs  to  two
              or more groups, it is the group with the lowest precedence value
              whose role ARN is given  in  the  user's  tokens  for  the  cog-
              nito:roles and cognito:preferred_role claims.

              Two  groups can have the same Precedence value. If this happens,
              neither group takes precedence over the  other.  If  two  groups
              with  the  same  Precedence have the same role ARN, that role is
              used in the cognito:preferred_role claim in tokens for users  in
              each group. If the two groups have different role ARNs, the cog-
              nito:preferred_role claim isn't set in users' tokens.

              The default Precedence value is null.

          LastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date the group was last modified.

          CreationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date the group was created.
