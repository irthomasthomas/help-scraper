CONFIRM-SIGN-UP()                                            CONFIRM-SIGN-UP()



NAME
       confirm-sign-up -

DESCRIPTION
       This  public  API operation provides a code that Amazon Cognito sent to
       your user when they signed up in your user pool via the SignUp API  op-
       eration.  After  your user enters their code, they confirm ownership of
       the email address or phone number that they provided,  and  their  user
       account becomes active. Depending on your user pool configuration, your
       users will receive their confirmation code in an email or SMS message.

       Local users who signed up in your user pool are the only type  of  user
       who  can confirm sign-up with a code. Users who federate through an ex-
       ternal identity provider (IdP) have already  been  confirmed  by  their
       IdP.    Administrator-created    users,    users   created   with   the
       AdminCreateUser API operation, confirm their accounts when they respond
       to  their  invitation  email message and choose a password. They do not
       receive a confirmation code. Instead, they receive  a  temporary  pass-
       word.

       NOTE:
          Amazon Cognito doesn't evaluate Identity and Access Management (IAM)
          policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you
          can't use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you can't grant
          IAM permissions in policies. For more information  about  authoriza-
          tion  models  in  Amazon  Cognito, see Using the Amazon Cognito user
          pools API and user pool endpoints .

OPTIONS
       --client-id (string)
          The ID of the app client associated with the user pool.

       --secret-hash (string)
          A keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) calculated using the
          secret  key of a user pool client and username plus the client ID in
          the message.

       --username (string)
          The username of the user that you want to query or modify. The value
          of  this  parameter is typically your user's username, but it can be
          any of their alias attributes. If username isn't an alias  attribute
          in your user pool, this value must be the sub of a local user or the
          username of a user from a third-party IdP.

       --confirmation-code (string)
          The confirmation code sent by a user's request to confirm  registra-
          tion.

       --force-alias-creation | --no-force-alias-creation (boolean)
          Boolean  to  be specified to force user confirmation irrespective of
          existing alias. By default set to False . If this parameter  is  set
          to True and the phone number/email used for sign up confirmation al-
          ready exists as an alias with a different user, the  API  call  will
          migrate  the  alias from the previous user to the newly created user
          being confirmed. If set to False , the API will throw an AliasExist-
          sException error.

       --analytics-metadata (structure)
          The  Amazon  Pinpoint  analytics metadata for collecting metrics for
          ConfirmSignUp calls.

          AnalyticsEndpointId -> (string)
              The endpoint ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AnalyticsEndpointId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AnalyticsEndpointId": "string"
          }

       --user-context-data (structure)
          Contextual data about your user session, such as the device  finger-
          print,  IP  address,  or  location. Amazon Cognito advanced security
          evaluates the risk of an authentication event based on  the  context
          that  your  app generates and passes to Amazon Cognito when it makes
          API requests.

          IpAddress -> (string)
              The source IP address of your user's device.

          EncodedData -> (string)
              Encoded device-fingerprint details that your app collected  with
              the Amazon Cognito context data collection library. For more in-
              formation, see Adding user device and session data  to  API  re-
              quests .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          IpAddress=string,EncodedData=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "IpAddress": "string",
            "EncodedData": "string"
          }

       --client-metadata (map)
          A  map  of  custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for
          any custom workflows that this action triggers.

          You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda  functions  to  user
          pool  triggers.  When  you  use the ConfirmSignUp API action, Amazon
          Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the post  confirma-
          tion trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a
          JSON payload, which the function receives  as  input.  This  payload
          contains  a  clientMetadata  attribute, which provides the data that
          you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in  your  ConfirmSignUp
          request.  In  your  function  code  in  Lambda,  you can process the
          clientMetadata value to enhance  your  workflow  for  your  specific
          needs.

          For  more  information,  see  Customizing  user  pool Workflows with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              When you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that  Amazon
              Cognito won't do the following:

              o Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to
                Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user  pool  to  support
                custom  workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't in-
                clude triggers, the ClientMetadata parameter  serves  no  pur-
                pose.

              o Validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Encrypt  the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito to
                provide sensitive information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
