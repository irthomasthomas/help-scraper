GET-GROUP()                                                        GET-GROUP()



NAME
       get-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a group.

       Calling this action requires developer credentials.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-group
          --group-name <value>
          --user-pool-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)
          The name of the group.

       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about a group

       This example gets information about a group named MyGroup.

       Command:

          aws cognito-idp get-group --user-pool-id us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa --group-name MyGroup

       Output:

          {
            "Group": {
                "GroupName": "MyGroup",
                "UserPoolId": "us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa",
                "Description": "A sample group.",
                "LastModifiedDate": 1548270073.795,
                "CreationDate": 1548270073.795
            }
          }

OUTPUT
       Group -> (structure)
          The group object for the group.

          GroupName -> (string)
              The name of the group.

          UserPoolId -> (string)
              The user pool ID for the user pool.

          Description -> (string)
              A string containing the description of the group.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the group.

          Precedence -> (integer)
              A  non-negative  integer  value that specifies the precedence of
              this group relative to the other groups that a user  can  belong
              to  in  the  user  pool.  Zero  is the highest precedence value.
              Groups with lower Precedence values take precedence over  groups
              with  higher  ornull Precedence values. If a user belongs to two
              or more groups, it is the group with the lowest precedence value
              whose  role  ARN  is  given  in  the  user's tokens for the cog-
              nito:roles and cognito:preferred_role claims.

              Two groups can have the same Precedence value. If this  happens,
              neither  group  takes  precedence  over the other. If two groups
              with the same Precedence have the same role ARN,  that  role  is
              used  in the cognito:preferred_role claim in tokens for users in
              each group. If the two groups have different role ARNs, the cog-
              nito:preferred_role claim isn't set in users' tokens.

              The default Precedence value is null.

          LastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date the group was last modified.

          CreationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date the group was created.
