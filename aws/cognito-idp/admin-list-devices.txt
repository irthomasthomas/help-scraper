OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID.

       --username (string)
          The username of the user that you want to query or modify. The value
          of  this  parameter is typically your user's username, but it can be
          any of their alias attributes. If username isn't an alias  attribute
          in your user pool, this value must be the sub of a local user or the
          username of a user from a third-party IdP.

       --limit (integer)
          The limit of the devices request.

       --pagination-token (string)
          This API operation returns a limited number of results. The  pagina-
          tion  token  is  an identifier that you can present in an additional
          API request with the same parameters. When you include  the  pagina-
          tion  token,  Amazon Cognito returns the next set of items after the
          current list. Subsequent requests return a new pagination token.  By
          use of this token, you can paginate through the full list of items.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list devices for a user

       This example lists devices for username jane@example.com.

       Command:

          aws cognito-idp admin-list-devices --user-pool-id us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa --username jane@example.com

OUTPUT
       Devices -> (list)
          The devices in the list of devices response.

          (structure)
              The device type.

              DeviceKey -> (string)
                 The device key.

              DeviceAttributes -> (list)
                 The device attributes.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies whether the attribute is standard or custom.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the attribute.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the attribute.

              DeviceCreateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The creation date of the device.

              DeviceLastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time when the item was modified. Amazon Cognito
                 returns this timestamp in UNIX epoch time  format.  Your  SDK
                 might  render  the output in a human-readable format like ISO
                 8601 or a Java Date object.

              DeviceLastAuthenticatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date when the device was last authenticated.

       PaginationToken -> (string)
          The identifier that Amazon Cognito returned with  the  previous  re-
          quest to this operation. When you include a pagination token in your
          request, Amazon Cognito returns the next set of items in  the  list.
          By  use  of  this  token,  you can paginate through the full list of
          items.
