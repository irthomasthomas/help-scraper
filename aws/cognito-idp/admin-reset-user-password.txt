ADMIN-RESET-USER-PASSWORD()                        ADMIN-RESET-USER-PASSWORD()



NAME
       admin-reset-user-password -

DESCRIPTION
       Resets  the  specified user's password in a user pool as an administra-
       tor. Works on any user.

       To use this API operation, your user pool must  have  self-service  ac-
       count recovery configured. Use AdminSetUserPassword if you manage pass-
       words as an administrator.

       NOTE:
          This action might generate an SMS text  message.  Starting  June  1,
          2021,  US  telecom  carriers  require you to register an origination
          phone number before you can send SMS messages to US  phone  numbers.
          If  you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a
          phone number with Amazon Pinpoint . Amazon Cognito uses  the  regis-
          tered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must
          receive SMS messages might not be able to sign  up,  activate  their
          accounts, or sign in.

          If  you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any
          other Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Simple  Notification  Ser-
          vice  might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In * sandbox mode
          * , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After  you
          test  your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of
          the sandbox and into production. For more information, see SMS  mes-
          sage  settings  for  Amazon Cognito user pools in the Amazon Cognito
          Developer Guide .

       Deactivates a user's password, requiring them to change it. If  a  user
       tries  to sign in after the API is called, Amazon Cognito responds with
       a PasswordResetRequiredException error. Your app must then perform  the
       actions  that  reset your user's password: the forgot-password flow. In
       addition, if the user pool has phone verification selected and a  veri-
       fied  phone number exists for the user, or if email verification is se-
       lected and a verified email exists for the user, calling this API  will
       also  result  in  sending  a  message  to the end user with the code to
       change their password.

       NOTE:
          Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM)  poli-
          cies  in  requests  for  this API operation. For this operation, you
          must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you  must  grant
          yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The  user  pool  ID  for  the  user pool where you want to reset the
          user's password.

       --username (string)
          The username of the user that you want to query or modify. The value
          of  this  parameter is typically your user's username, but it can be
          any of their alias attributes. If username isn't an alias  attribute
          in your user pool, this value must be the sub of a local user or the
          username of a user from a third-party IdP.

       --client-metadata (map)
          A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide  as  input  for
          any custom workflows that this action triggers.

          You  create  custom  workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user
          pool triggers. When you use the AdminResetUserPassword  API  action,
          Amazon  Cognito  invokes the function that is assigned to the custom
          message trigger. When  Amazon  Cognito  invokes  this  function,  it
          passes  a  JSON  payload, which the function receives as input. This
          payload contains a clientMetadata attribute, which provides the data
          that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminRese-
          tUserPassword request. In your function  code  in  Lambda,  you  can
          process  the  clientMetadata value to enhance your workflow for your
          specific needs.

          For more information,  see  Customizing  user  pool  Workflows  with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              When  you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that Amazon
              Cognito won't do the following:

              o Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to
                Lambda  triggers  that  are assigned to a user pool to support
                custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't  in-
                clude  triggers,  the  ClientMetadata parameter serves no pur-
                pose.

              o Validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Encrypt the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito  to
                provide sensitive information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
