       list-users is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: Users

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The  user  pool  ID  for the user pool on which the search should be
          performed.

       --attributes-to-get (list)
          A JSON array of user attribute names, for example given_name ,  that
          you  want  Amazon  Cognito to include in the response for each user.
          When you don't provide an AttributesToGet parameter, Amazon  Cognito
          returns all attributes for each user.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filter (string)
          A  filter string of the form "AttributeName  Filter-Type "Attribute-
          Value "". Quotation marks within the filter string must  be  escaped
          using  the  backslash  ()  character.  For  example,  "family_name =
          "Reddy"".

          o AttributeName : The name of the attribute to search for.  You  can
            only search for one attribute at a time.

          o Filter-Type  : For an exact match, use =, for example, "given_name
            = "Jon"". For a prefix ("starts with") match, use ^=, for example,
            "given_name ^= "Jon"".

          o AttributeValue : The attribute value that must be matched for each
            user.

          If the filter string is empty, ListUsers returns all  users  in  the
          user pool.

          You can only search for the following standard attributes:

          o username (case-sensitive)

          o email

          o phone_number

          o name

          o given_name

          o family_name

          o preferred_username

          o cognito:user_status  (called Status in the Console) (case-insensi-
            tive)

          o status (called **Enabled** in the Console) (case-sensitive)

          o sub

          Custom attributes aren't searchable.

          NOTE:
              You  can  also  list  users  with  a  client-side  filter.   The
              server-side  filter  matches  no more than one attribute. For an
              advanced search, use a client-side filter with the  --query  pa-
              rameter  of  the  list-users  action  in the CLI. When you use a
              client-side filter, ListUsers returns a paginated list  of  zero
              or more users. You can receive multiple pages in a row with zero
              results. Repeat the query with each pagination token that is re-
              turned until you receive a null pagination token value, and then
              review the combined result.

              For more information about server-side and  client-side  filter-
              ing,  see FilteringCLI output in the Command Line Interface User
              Guide .

          For more information, see Searching for Users  Using  the  ListUsers
          API  and  Examples  of Using the ListUsers API in the Amazon Cognito
          Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list users

       This example lists up to 20 users.

       Command:

          aws cognito-idp list-users --user-pool-id us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa --limit 20

       Output:

          {
            "Users": [
                {
                    "Username": "22704aa3-fc10-479a-97eb-2af5806bd327",
                    "Enabled": true,
                    "UserStatus": "FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD",
                    "UserCreateDate": 1548089817.683,
                    "UserLastModifiedDate": 1548089817.683,
                    "Attributes": [
                        {
                            "Name": "sub",
                            "Value": "22704aa3-fc10-479a-97eb-2af5806bd327"
                        },
                        {
                            "Name": "email_verified",
                            "Value": "true"
                        },
                        {
                            "Name": "email",
                            "Value": "mary@example.com"

                    ]
                }
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Users -> (list)
          A list of the user pool users, and their attributes, that match your
          query.

          NOTE:
              Amazon Cognito creates a profile in your user pool for each  na-
              tive  user  in your user pool, and each unique user ID from your
              third-party identity providers (IdPs). When you link users  with
              the  AdminLinkProviderForUser  API operation, the output of Lis-
              tUsers displays both the IdP user and the native user  that  you
              linked.  You  can identify IdP users in the Users object of this
              API response by the IdP prefix that Amazon  Cognito  appends  to
              Username .

              UserLastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in ISO 8601 format, when the item was mod-
                 ified.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the user is enabled.

              UserStatus -> (string)
                 The user status. This can be one of the following:

                 o UNCONFIRMED - User has been created but not confirmed.

                 o CONFIRMED - User has been confirmed.

                 o EXTERNAL_PROVIDER - User signed in with a third-party IdP.

                 o UNKNOWN - User status isn't known.

                 o RESET_REQUIRED - User is confirmed, but the user  must  re-
                   quest  a code and reset their password before they can sign
                   in.

                 o FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD - The user is confirmed and the  user
                   can  sign  in  using  a  temporary  password,  but on first
                   sign-in, the user must change their password to a new value
                   before doing anything else.

              MFAOptions -> (list)

                        this  parameter  to  set  only the SMS delivery medium
                        value.

                     AttributeName -> (string)
                        The attribute name of the MFA option  type.  The  only
                        valid value is phone_number .

       PaginationToken -> (string)
          An identifier that was returned from the previous call to this oper-
