ADMIN-CONFIRM-SIGN-UP()                                ADMIN-CONFIRM-SIGN-UP()



NAME
       admin-confirm-sign-up -

DESCRIPTION
       This  IAM-authenticated  API operation provides a code that Amazon Cog-
       nito sent to your user when they signed up in  your  user  pool.  After
       your  user  enters  their code, they confirm ownership of the email ad-
       dress or phone number that they provided, and their  user  account  be-
       comes  active.  Depending  on  your user pool configuration, your users
       will receive their confirmation code in an email or SMS message.

       Local users who signed up in your user pool are the only type  of  user
       who  can confirm sign-up with a code. Users who federate through an ex-
       ternal identity provider (IdP) have already  been  confirmed  by  their
       IdP.  Administrator-created  users confirm their accounts when they re-
       spond to their invitation email message and choose a password.

       NOTE:
          Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM)  poli-
          cies  in  requests  for  this API operation. For this operation, you
          must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you  must  grant
          yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for which you want to confirm user registration.

       --username (string)
          The username of the user that you want to query or modify. The value
          of this parameter is typically your user's username, but it  can  be
          any  of their alias attributes. If username isn't an alias attribute
          in your user pool, you can also use their sub in this request.

       --client-metadata (map)
          A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide  as  input  for
          any custom workflows that this action triggers.

          If your user pool configuration includes triggers, the AdminConfirm-
          SignUp API action invokes the Lambda function that is specified  for
          the  post  confirmation  trigger.  When  Amazon Cognito invokes this
          function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function  receives  as
          input.  In  this  payload, the clientMetadata attribute provides the
          data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in  your  Ad-
          minConfirmSignUp  request.  In your function code in Lambda, you can
          process the ClientMetadata value to enhance your workflow  for  your
          specific needs.

          For  more  information,  see  Customizing  user  pool Workflows with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              When you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that  Amazon
              Cognito won't do the following:

              o Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to
                Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user  pool  to  support
                custom  workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't in-
                clude triggers, the ClientMetadata parameter  serves  no  pur-
                pose.

              o Validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Encrypt  the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito to
                provide sensitive information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
