ADMIN-CONFIRM-SIGN-UP()                                ADMIN-CONFIRM-SIGN-UP()



NAME
       admin-confirm-sign-up -

DESCRIPTION
       This IAM-authenticated API operation confirms user sign-up as an admin-
       istrator. Unlike ConfirmSignUp , your IAM  credentials  authorize  user
       account confirmation. No confirmation code is required.

       This  request  sets  a user account active in a user pool that requires
       confirmation of new user accounts before they can sign in. You can con-
       figure  your  user pool to not send confirmation codes to new users and
       instead confirm them with this API operation on the back end.

       NOTE:
          Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM)  poli-
          cies  in  requests  for  this API operation. For this operation, you
          must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you  must  grant
          yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for which you want to confirm user registration.

       --username (string)
          The username of the user that you want to query or modify. The value
          of this parameter is typically your user's username, but it  can  be
          any  of their alias attributes. If username isn't an alias attribute
          in your user pool, this value must be the sub of a local user or the
          username of a user from a third-party IdP.

       --client-metadata (map)
          A  map  of  custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for
          any custom workflows that this action triggers.

          If your user pool configuration includes triggers, the AdminConfirm-
          SignUp  API action invokes the Lambda function that is specified for
          the post confirmation trigger.  When  Amazon  Cognito  invokes  this
          function,  it  passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as
          input. In this payload, the clientMetadata  attribute  provides  the
          data  that  you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your Ad-
          minConfirmSignUp request. In your function code in Lambda,  you  can
          process  the  ClientMetadata value to enhance your workflow for your
          specific needs.

          For more information,  see  Customizing  user  pool  Workflows  with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              When  you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that Amazon
              Cognito won't do the following:

              o Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to
                Lambda  triggers  that  are assigned to a user pool to support
                custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't  in-
                clude  triggers,  the  ClientMetadata parameter serves no pur-
                pose.

              o Validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Encrypt the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito  to
                provide sensitive information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       o on

       o off

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
