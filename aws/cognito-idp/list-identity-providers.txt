       list-identity-providers -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists information about all IdPs for a user pool.

       NOTE:
          Amazon  Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) poli-
          cies in requests for this API operation.  For  this  operation,  you
          must  use  IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant
          yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

       list-identity-providers is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: Providers

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Providers -> (list)
          A list of IdP objects.

          (structure)
              The details of a user pool identity  provider  (IdP),  including
              name and type.

              This  data type is a response parameter of ListIdentityProviders
              .

              ProviderName -> (string)
                 The name of the IdP, for example MySAMLProvider .

              ProviderType -> (string)
                 The type of the provider, for example SAML .  Amazon  Cognito
                 supports  SAML  2.0,  OIDC,  and social IdPs. User pools list
                 supported social IdPs by name  in  this  response  parameter:
                 Facebook, Google, Login with Amazon, and Sign in with Apple.

              LastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time when the item was modified. Amazon Cognito
                 returns this timestamp in UNIX epoch time  format.  Your  SDK
                 might  render  the output in a human-readable format like ISO
                 8601 or a Java Date object.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the item was created.  Amazon  Cognito
                 returns  this  timestamp  in UNIX epoch time format. Your SDK
                 might render the output in a human-readable format  like  ISO
                 8601 or a Java Date object.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A pagination token.
