OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool that the users are being imported
          into.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of import jobs you want the request to return.

       --pagination-token (string)
          This  API operation returns a limited number of results. The pagina-
          tion token is an identifier that you can present  in  an  additional
          API  request  with the same parameters. When you include the pagina-
          tion token, Amazon Cognito returns the next set of items  after  the
          current  list. Subsequent requests return a new pagination token. By
          use of this token, you can paginate through the full list of items.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list user import jobs

       This example lists user import jobs.

OUTPUT
       UserImportJobs -> (list)
          The user import jobs.

          (structure)
              A user import job in a user pool. Describes the status  of  user
              import  with  a  CSV  file.  For more information, see Importing
              users into user pools from a CSV file .

              This data type is a request parameter of  CreateUserImportJob  ,
              DescribeUserImportJob  , ListUserImportJobs , StartUserImportJob
              , and StopUserImportJob .

              JobName -> (string)
                 The friendly name of the user import job.

              JobId -> (string)
                 The ID of the user import job.

              UserPoolId -> (string)
                 The ID of the user pool that the  users  are  being  imported
                 into.

              PreSignedUrl -> (string)

                 The  date  and time when the item was created. Amazon Cognito
                 returns this timestamp in UNIX epoch time  format.  Your  SDK
                 might  render  the output in a human-readable format like ISO
                 8601 or a Java Date object.

              StartDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date when the user import job was started.

              CompletionDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date when the user import job was completed.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the user import job. One of the following:

                 o Created - The job was created but not started.

                 o Pending - A transition state. You have started the job, but
                   it has not begun importing users yet.

                 o InProgress  -  The job has started, and users are being im-
                   ported.

                 o Stopping - You have stopped the job, but the  job  has  not
                   stopped importing users yet.

                 o Stopped - You have stopped the job, and the job has stopped
                   importing users.

                 o Succeeded - The job has completed successfully.

                 o Failed - The job has stopped due to an error.

                 o Expired - You created a job, but  did  not  start  the  job
                   within  24-48  hours.  All data associated with the job was
                   deleted, and the job can't be started.

              CloudWatchLogsRoleArn -> (string)
                 The role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Amazon CloudWatch
                 Logging  role  for the user import job. For more information,
                 see "Creating the CloudWatch Logs IAM  Role"  in  the  Amazon
                 Cognito Developer Guide.

              ImportedUsers -> (long)
                 The number of users that were successfully imported.

              SkippedUsers -> (long)
                 The number of users that were skipped.

              FailedUsers -> (long)
                 The number of users that couldn't be imported.

              CompletionMessage -> (string)
                 The message returned when the user import job is completed.

       PaginationToken -> (string)
          The  identifier  that  Amazon Cognito returned with the previous re-
          quest to this operation. When you include a pagination token in your
          request,  Amazon  Cognito returns the next set of items in the list.
          By use of this token, you can paginate  through  the  full  list  of
          items.
