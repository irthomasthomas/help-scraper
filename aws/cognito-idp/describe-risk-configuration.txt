            describe-risk-configuration
          --user-pool-id <value>
          [--client-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID.

       --client-id (string)
          The app client ID.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 advanced security features assesses a risk level  with  adap-
                 tive  authentication.  When you choose to notify users in Ac-
                 countTakeoverRiskConfiguration  ,  Amazon  Cognito  sends  an
                 email message using the method and template that you set with

                        The  action to take for the attempted account takeover
                        action for the associated risk level. Valid values are
                        as follows:

                        o BLOCK : Block the request.

                        o MFA_IF_CONFIGURED : Present an MFA challenge if pos-
                          sible. MFA is possible if the user pool  has  active
                          MFA  methods  that the user can set up. For example,
                          if the user pool only supports SMS message  MFA  but
                          the  user doesn't have a phone number attribute, MFA
                          setup isn't possible. If MFA setup  isn't  possible,

                        o MFA_REQUIRED : Present an MFA challenge if possible.
                          Block the request if a user hasn't set  up  MFA.  To
                          sign  in with required MFA, users must have an email
                          address or phone number attribute, or  a  registered
                          TOTP factor.

                        o NO_ACTION : Take no action. Permit sign-in.

                 MediumAction -> (structure)
                     The action that you assign to a medium-risk assessment by
                     advanced security features.

                     Notify -> (boolean)
                        Determines whether Amazon Cognito sends a user a noti-
                        fication  message  when  your  user  pools  assesses a
                        user's session at the associated risk level.

                        The action to take for the attempted account  takeover
                        action for the associated risk level. Valid values are
                        as follows:

                        o BLOCK : Block the request.

                        o MFA_IF_CONFIGURED : Present an MFA challenge if pos-
                          sible.  MFA  is possible if the user pool has active
                          MFA methods that the user can set up.  For  example,
                          if  the  user pool only supports SMS message MFA but
                          the user doesn't have a phone number attribute,  MFA
                          setup  isn't  possible. If MFA setup isn't possible,
                          allow the request.

                        o MFA_REQUIRED : Present an MFA challenge if possible.
                          Block  the  request  if a user hasn't set up MFA. To
                          sign in with required MFA, users must have an  email
                          address  or  phone number attribute, or a registered
                          TOTP factor.

                        o NO_ACTION : Take no action. Permit sign-in.

                 HighAction -> (structure)
                     The action that you assign to a high-risk  assessment  by
                     advanced security features.

                     Notify -> (boolean)
                        Determines whether Amazon Cognito sends a user a noti-
                        fication message  when  your  user  pools  assesses  a
                        user's session at the associated risk level.

                     EventAction -> (string)
                        The  action to take for the attempted account takeover
                        action for the associated risk level. Valid values are
                        as follows:

                        o BLOCK : Block the request.

                        o MFA_IF_CONFIGURED : Present an MFA challenge if pos-
                          sible. MFA is possible if the user pool  has  active
                          MFA  methods  that the user can set up. For example,
                          if the user pool only supports SMS message  MFA  but
                          the  user doesn't have a phone number attribute, MFA
                          setup isn't possible. If MFA setup  isn't  possible,
                          allow the request.

                        o MFA_REQUIRED : Present an MFA challenge if possible.
                          Block the request if a user hasn't set  up  MFA.  To
                          sign  in with required MFA, users must have an email
                          address or phone number attribute, or  a  registered
                          TOTP factor.

                        o NO_ACTION : Take no action. Permit sign-in.

          RiskExceptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              Exceptions  to  the risk evaluation configuration, including al-
              ways-allow and always-block IP address ranges.

              BlockedIPRangeList -> (list)
                 An always-block IP address list. Overrides the risk  decision
                 and  always blocks authentication requests. This parameter is
                 displayed and set in CIDR notation.

                 (string)

              SkippedIPRangeList -> (list)
                 An always-allow IP address list. Risk  detection  isn't  per-
                 formed on the IP addresses in this range list. This parameter
                 is displayed and set in CIDR notation.

                 (string)

          LastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the item was modified. Amazon Cognito re-
              turns  this  timestamp in UNIX epoch time format. Your SDK might
              render the output in a human-readable format like ISO 8601 or  a
              Java Date object.
