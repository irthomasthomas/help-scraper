NAME
       admin-disable-provider-for-user -

DESCRIPTION
       Prevents  the user from signing in with the specified external (SAML or
       social) identity provider (IdP). If the user that you want  to  deacti-
       vate  is  a  Amazon Cognito user pools native username + password user,
       they can't use their password to sign in. If the user to deactivate  is
       a  linked external IdP user, any link between that user and an existing
       user is removed. When the external user signs in again, and the user is
       no  longer attached to the previously linked DestinationUser , the user
       must create a new user account. See AdminLinkProviderForUser .

       The ProviderName must match the value specified when  creating  an  IdP
       for the pool.

       To deactivate a native username + password user, the ProviderName value
       must be Cognito and the ProviderAttributeName must be Cognito_Subject .
       The  ProviderAttributeValue  must  be the name that is used in the user
       pool for the user.

       The ProviderAttributeName must always  be  Cognito_Subject  for  social
       IdPs.  The ProviderAttributeValue must always be the exact subject that
       was used when the user was originally linked as a source user.

       For de-linking a SAML identity, there are two scenarios. If the  linked
       identity  has  not  yet been used to sign in, the ProviderAttributeName
       and ProviderAttributeValue must be the same values that were  used  for
       the  SourceUser when the identities were originally linked using Admin-
       LinkProviderForUser call. (If the linking  was  done  with  ProviderAt-
       tributeName  set  to Cognito_Subject , the same applies here). However,
       if the user has already signed in, the  ProviderAttributeName  must  be
       Cognito_Subject  and  ProviderAttributeValue must be the subject of the
       SAML assertion.

       NOTE:
          Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM)  poli-
          cies  in  requests  for  this API operation. For this operation, you
          must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you  must  grant
          yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool.

       --user (structure)
          The user to be disabled.

          ProviderName -> (string)
              The  name  of  the  provider, such as Facebook, Google, or Login
              with Amazon.

          ProviderAttributeName -> (string)
              The name of the provider attribute to link to, such as NameID .

          ProviderAttributeValue -> (string)
              The value  of  the  provider  attribute  to  link  to,  such  as
              xxxxx_account .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ProviderName=string,ProviderAttributeName=string,ProviderAttributeValue=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ProviderName": "string",
            "ProviderAttributeName": "string",
            "ProviderAttributeValue": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.
