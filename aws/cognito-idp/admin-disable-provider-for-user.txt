NAME
       admin-disable-provider-for-user -

DESCRIPTION
       Prevents  the user from signing in with the specified external (SAML or
       social) identity provider. If the user that you want to deactivate is a
       Amazon  Cognito  user pools native username + password user, they can't
       use their password to sign in. If the user to deactivate  is  a  linked
       external  identity  provider (IdP) user, any link between that user and
       an existing user is removed. When the external user signs in again, and
       the user is no longer attached to the previously linked DestinationUser
       , the user must create a new user account. See AdminLinkProviderForUser
       .

       This  action  is  enabled  only for admin access and requires developer
       credentials.

       The ProviderName must match the value specified when  creating  an  IdP
       for the pool.

       To deactivate a native username + password user, the ProviderName value
       must be Cognito and the ProviderAttributeName must be Cognito_Subject .
       The  ProviderAttributeValue  must  be the name that is used in the user
       pool for the user.

       The ProviderAttributeName must always  be  Cognito_Subject  for  social
       identity providers. The ProviderAttributeValue must always be the exact
       subject that was used when the user was originally linked as  a  source
       user.

       For  de-linking a SAML identity, there are two scenarios. If the linked
       identity has not yet been used to sign  in,  the  ProviderAttributeName
       and  ProviderAttributeValue  must be the same values that were used for
       the SourceUser when the identities were originally linked using  Admin-
       LinkProviderForUser  call.  (If  the  linking was done with ProviderAt-
       tributeName set to Cognito_Subject , the same applies  here).  However,
       if  the  user  has already signed in, the ProviderAttributeName must be
       Cognito_Subject and ProviderAttributeValue must be the subject  of  the
       SAML assertion.

SYNOPSIS
            admin-disable-provider-for-user
          --user-pool-id <value>
          --user <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool.

       --user (structure)
          The user to be disabled.

          ProviderName -> (string)
              The  name  of  the  provider, such as Facebook, Google, or Login
              with Amazon.

          ProviderAttributeName -> (string)
              The name of the provider attribute to link to, such as NameID .

          ProviderAttributeValue -> (string)
              The value  of  the  provider  attribute  to  link  to,  such  as
              xxxxx_account .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ProviderName=string,ProviderAttributeName=string,ProviderAttributeValue=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ProviderName": "string",
            "ProviderAttributeName": "string",
            "ProviderAttributeValue": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
