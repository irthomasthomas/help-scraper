NAME
       admin-update-user-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  action  might  generate  an SMS text message. Starting June 1,
          2021, US telecom carriers require you  to  register  an  origination
          phone  number  before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers.
          If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register  a
          phone  number  with Amazon Pinpoint . Amazon Cognito uses the regis-
          tered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must
          receive  SMS  messages  might not be able to sign up, activate their
          accounts, or sign in.

          If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or  any
          other  Amazon  Web Service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might
          place your account in the SMS sandbox. In * sandbox mode * , you can
          send  messages  only  to verified phone numbers. After you test your
          app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the  sand-
          box  and into production. For more information, see SMS message set-
          tings for Amazon Cognito user pools in the Amazon Cognito  Developer
          Guide .

       Updates  the  specified  user's  attributes,  including  developer  at-
       tributes, as an administrator. Works on any user.

       For custom attributes, you must prepend the custom: prefix to  the  at-
       tribute name.

       In  addition  to updating user attributes, this API can also be used to
       mark phone and email as verified.

       NOTE:
          Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM)  poli-
          cies  in  requests  for  this API operation. For this operation, you
          must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you  must  grant
          yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

          --user-attributes <value>

          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool where you want to update user at-
          tributes.

       --username (string)
          The user name of the user for whom  you  want  to  update  user  at-
          tributes.

       --user-attributes (list)
          An array of name-value pairs representing user attributes.

          For  custom  attributes,  you must prepend the custom: prefix to the
          attribute name.

          If your user pool requires verification before  Amazon  Cognito  up-
          dates  an  attribute  value that you specify in this request, Amazon
          Cognito doesnt immediately update the value of that attribute. After
          your  user receives and responds to a verification message to verify
          the new value, Amazon Cognito updates the attribute value. Your user
          can  sign  in and receive messages with the original attribute value
          until they verify the new value.

          To update the value of an attribute that  requires  verification  in
          the  same  API  request,  include  the  email_verified or phone_num-
          ber_verified attribute, with a value  of  true  .  If  you  set  the
          email_verified  or  phone_number_verified  value  for  an  email  or
          phone_number attribute that requires verification to true  ,  Amazon
          Cognito doesnt send a verification message to your user.

          (structure)
              Specifies whether the attribute is standard or custom.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the attribute.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the attribute.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-metadata (map)
          A  map  of  custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for
          any custom workflows that this action triggers.

          You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda  functions  to  user
          pool  triggers.  When  you use the AdminUpdateUserAttributes API ac-
          tion, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is  assigned  to  the
          custom  message  trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function,
          it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This
          payload contains a clientMetadata attribute, which provides the data
          that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminUpda-
          teUserAttributes  request.  In your function code in Lambda, you can
          process the clientMetadata value to enhance your workflow  for  your
          specific needs.

          For  more  information,  see  Customizing  user  pool Workflows with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              When you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that  Amazon
              Cognito won't do the following:

              o Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to
                Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user  pool  to  support
                custom  workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't in-
                clude triggers, the ClientMetadata parameter  serves  no  pur-
                pose.

              o Validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Encrypt  the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito to
                provide sensitive information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
