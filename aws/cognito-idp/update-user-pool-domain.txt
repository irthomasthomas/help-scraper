UPDATE-USER-POOL-DOMAIN()                            UPDATE-USER-POOL-DOMAIN()



NAME
       update-user-pool-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate for the custom do-
       main for your user pool.

       You can use this operation to provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
       a new certificate to Amazon Cognito. You can't use it to change the do-
       main for a user pool.

       A custom domain is used to host the Amazon  Cognito  hosted  UI,  which
       provides  sign-up  and sign-in pages for your application. When you set
       up a custom domain, you provide a certificate that you manage with Cer-
       tificate  Manager  (ACM). When necessary, you can use this operation to
       change the certificate that you applied to your custom domain.

       Usually, this is unnecessary following routine certificate renewal with
       ACM.  When you renew your existing certificate in ACM, the ARN for your
       certificate remains the same, and your custom domain uses the new  cer-
       tificate automatically.

       However,  if  you replace your existing certificate with a new one, ACM
       gives the new certificate a new ARN. To apply the  new  certificate  to
       your custom domain, you must provide this ARN to Amazon Cognito.

       When  you  add your new certificate in ACM, you must choose US East (N.
       Virginia) as the Amazon Web Services Region.

       After you submit your request, Amazon Cognito requires up to 1 hour  to
       distribute your new certificate to your custom domain.

       For  more  information  about adding a custom domain to your user pool,
       see Using Your Own Domain for the Hosted UI .

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The domain name for the custom domain that  hosts  the  sign-up  and
          sign-in  pages for your application. One example might be auth.exam-
          ple.com .

          This string can include only lowercase  letters,  numbers,  and  hy-
          phens. Don't use a hyphen for the first or last character. Use peri-
          ods to separate subdomain names.

       --user-pool-id (string)
          The ID of the user pool that is associated with  the  custom  domain
          whose certificate you're updating.

       --custom-domain-config (structure)
          The  configuration  for  a  custom domain that hosts the sign-up and
          sign-in pages for your application. Use this object  to  specify  an
          SSL certificate that is managed by ACM.

          CertificateArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of an Certificate Manager SSL
              certificate. You use this certificate for the subdomain of  your
              custom domain.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CertificateArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CertificateArn": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
