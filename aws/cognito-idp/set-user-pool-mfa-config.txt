SET-USER-POOL-MFA-CONFIG()                          SET-USER-POOL-MFA-CONFIG()



NAME
       set-user-pool-mfa-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets the user pool multi-factor authentication (MFA) configuration.

       NOTE:
          This  action  might  generate  an SMS text message. Starting June 1,
          2021, US telecom carriers require you  to  register  an  origination
          phone  number  before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers.
          If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register  a
          phone  number  with Amazon Pinpoint . Amazon Cognito uses the regis-
          tered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must
          receive  SMS  messages  might not be able to sign up, activate their
          accounts, or sign in.

          If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or  any
          other  Amazon  Web Service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might
          place your account in the SMS sandbox. In * sandbox mode * , you can
          send  messages  only  to verified phone numbers. After you test your
          app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the  sand-
          box  and into production. For more information, see SMS message set-
          tings for Amazon Cognito user pools in the Amazon Cognito  Developer
          Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            set-user-pool-mfa-config
          --user-pool-id <value>
          [--sms-mfa-configuration <value>]
          [--software-token-mfa-configuration <value>]
          [--mfa-configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID.

       --sms-mfa-configuration (structure)
          The SMS text message MFA configuration.

          SmsAuthenticationMessage -> (string)
              The  SMS  authentication message that will be sent to users with
              the code they must sign in. The message must contain the  {####}
              placeholder,  which  is  replaced  with the code. If the message
              isn't included, and default message will be used.

          SmsConfiguration -> (structure)
              The SMS configuration with the settings that your Amazon Cognito
              user  pool  must use to send an SMS message from your Amazon Web
              Services account through Amazon Simple Notification Service.  To
              request  Amazon  SNS  in the Amazon Web Services Region that you
              want, the Amazon Cognito user pool uses an Identity  and  Access
              Management  (IAM) role that you provide for your Amazon Web Ser-
              vices account.

              SnsCallerArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS caller. This
                 is  the  ARN  of the IAM role in your Amazon Web Services ac-
                 count that Amazon Cognito will use to send SMS messages.  SMS
                 messages are subject to a spending limit .

              ExternalId -> (string)
                 The  external  ID  provides  additional security for your IAM
                 role. You can use an ExternalId with the IAM  role  that  you
                 use  with Amazon SNS to send SMS messages for your user pool.
                 If you provide an ExternalId , your Amazon Cognito user  pool
                 includes  it  in the request to assume your IAM role. You can
                 configure the role trust policy to require that  Amazon  Cog-
                 nito,  and any principal, provide the ExternalID . If you use
                 the Amazon Cognito Management Console to create  a  role  for
                 SMS multi-factor authentication (MFA), Amazon Cognito creates
                 a role with the required permissions and a trust policy  that
                 demonstrates use of the ExternalId .

                 For  more information about the ExternalId of a role, see How
                 to use an external ID when granting access to your Amazon Web
                 Services resources to a third party

              SnsRegion -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web Services Region to use with Amazon SNS inte-
                 gration. You can choose the same Region as your user pool, or
                 a supported Legacy Amazon SNS alternate Region .

                 Amazon  Cognito  resources in the Asia Pacific (Seoul) Amazon
                 Web Services Region must use your Amazon SNS configuration in
                 the  Asia  Pacific  (Tokyo) Region. For more information, see
                 SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools .

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SmsAuthenticationMessage": "string",
            "SmsConfiguration": {
              "SnsCallerArn": "string",

              "SnsRegion": "string"
            }
          }

       --software-token-mfa-configuration (structure)
          The software token MFA configuration.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether software token MFA is activated.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Enabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Enabled": true|false
          }

       --mfa-configuration (string)
          The MFA configuration. If you set the MfaConfiguration value to  ON,
          only users who have set up an MFA factor can sign in. To learn more,
          see Adding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to a user pool .  Valid
          values include:

          o OFF MFA won't be used for any users.

          o ON MFA is required for all users to sign in.

          o OPTIONAL  MFA  will be required only for individual users who have
            an MFA factor activated.

          Possible values:

          o OFF

          o ON

          o OPTIONAL

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
