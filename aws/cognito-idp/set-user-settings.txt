SET-USER-SETTINGS()                                        SET-USER-SETTINGS()



NAME
       set-user-settings -

DESCRIPTION
          This action is no longer supported. You can use it to configure only
          SMS MFA. You can't use it to configure time-based one-time  password
          (TOTP)  software  token  MFA.  To  configure either type of MFA, use
          SetUserMFAPreference instead.

       NOTE:
          Amazon Cognito doesn't evaluate Identity and Access Management (IAM)
          policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you
          can't use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you can't grant
          IAM  permissions  in policies. For more information about authoriza-
          tion models in Amazon Cognito, see Using the Amazon  Cognito  native
          and OIDC APIs .

OPTIONS
       --access-token (string)
          A  valid  access  token that Amazon Cognito issued to the user whose
          user settings you want to configure.

       --mfa-options (list)
          You can use this parameter only to set  an  SMS  configuration  that
          uses SMS for delivery.

          (structure)
                 This  data  type  is no longer supported. Applies only to SMS
                 multi-factor authentication (MFA)  configurations.  Does  not
                 apply  to  time-based one-time password (TOTP) software token
                 MFA configurations.

              DeliveryMedium -> (string)
                 The delivery medium to send the MFA code. You  can  use  this
                 parameter to set only the SMS delivery medium value.

              AttributeName -> (string)
                 The  attribute  name  of  the MFA option type. The only valid
                 value is phone_number .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DeliveryMedium=string,AttributeName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "DeliveryMedium": "SMS"|"EMAIL",
              "AttributeName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To set user settings

       This example sets the MFA delivery preference to EMAIL.

       Command:

          aws cognito-idp set-user-settings --access-token ACCESS_TOKEN --mfa-options DeliveryMedium=EMAIL

OUTPUT
       None



                                                           SET-USER-SETTINGS()
