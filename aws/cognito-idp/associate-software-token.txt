ASSOCIATE-SOFTWARE-TOKEN()                          ASSOCIATE-SOFTWARE-TOKEN()



NAME
       associate-software-token -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a unique generated shared secret key code for the user account.
       The request takes an access token or a session string, but not both.

       NOTE:
          Calling AssociateSoftwareToken immediately disassociates the  exist-
          ing software token from the user account. If the user doesn't subse-
          quently verify the software token, their account is set  up  to  au-
          thenticate without MFA. If MFA config is set to Optional at the user
          pool level, the user can then log in without MFA. However, if MFA is
          set to Required for the user pool, the user is asked to set up a new
          software token MFA during sign-in.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-software-token
          [--access-token <value>]
          [--session <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --access-token (string)
          A valid access token that Amazon Cognito issued to  the  user  whose
          software token you want to generate.

       --session (string)
          The  session  that  should be passed both ways in challenge-response
          calls to the service. This allows authentication of the user as part
          of the MFA setup process.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SecretCode -> (string)
          A unique generated shared secret code that is used in the time-based
          one-time password (TOTP) algorithm to generate a one-time code.

       Session -> (string)
          The  session  that  should be passed both ways in challenge-response
          calls to the service. This allows authentication of the user as part
          of the MFA setup process.
