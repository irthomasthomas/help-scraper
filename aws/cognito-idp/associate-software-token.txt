ASSOCIATE-SOFTWARE-TOKEN()                          ASSOCIATE-SOFTWARE-TOKEN()



NAME
       associate-software-token -

DESCRIPTION
       Begins  setup  of  time-based one-time password (TOTP) multi-factor au-
       thentication (MFA) for a user, with a unique private  key  that  Amazon
       Cognito generates and returns in the API response. You can authorize an
       AssociateSoftwareToken request with either the user's access token,  or
       a  session string from a challenge response that you received from Ama-
       zon Cognito.

       NOTE:
          Amazon Cognito disassociates an existing  software  token  when  you
          verify  the  new  token in a VerifySoftwareToken API request. If you
          don't verify the software token and your user pool  doesn't  require
          MFA, the user can then authenticate with user name and password cre-
          dentials alone. If your user pool requires TOTP MFA, Amazon  Cognito
          generates  an  MFA_SETUP or SOFTWARE_TOKEN_SETUP challenge each time
          your user signs. Complete setup with AssociateSoftwareToken and Ver-
          ifySoftwareToken .

          After  you  set  up software token MFA for your user, Amazon Cognito
          generates a SOFTWARE_TOKEN_MFA challenge when they authenticate. Re-
          spond to this challenge with your user's TOTP.

OPTIONS
       --access-token (string)
          A  valid  access  token that Amazon Cognito issued to the user whose
          software token you want to generate.

       --session (string)
          The session that should be passed both  ways  in  challenge-response
          calls to the service. This allows authentication of the user as part
          of the MFA setup process.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       SecretCode -> (string)
          A unique generated shared secret code that is used in the TOTP algo-
          rithm to generate a one-time code.

       Session -> (string)
          The session that should be passed both  ways  in  challenge-response
          calls to the service. This allows authentication of the user as part
          of the MFA setup process.
