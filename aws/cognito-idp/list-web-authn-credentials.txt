OPTIONS
       --access-token (string)
          A valid access token that Amazon Cognito issued to  the  user  whose
          registered passkeys you want to list.

       --next-token (string)
          An identifier that was returned from the previous call to this oper-
          ation, which can be used to return the next  set  of  items  in  the
          list.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number of the user's passkey credentials that you want
          to return.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Credentials -> (list)
          A list of registered passkeys for a user.

          (structure)
              The details of a passkey, or webauthN, biometric or security-key
              authentication factor for a user.

              This     data     type    is    a    response    parameter    of
              ListWebAuthnCredentials .

              CredentialId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the passkey credential.

              FriendlyCredentialName -> (string)
                 An automatically-generated friendly name for the passkey cre-
                 dential.

              RelyingPartyId -> (string)
                 The  relying-party ID of the provider for the passkey creden-
                 tial.

              AuthenticatorAttachment -> (string)
                 The general category of the passkey authenticator. Can  be  a
                 platform,  or on-device authenticator like a built-in finger-
                 print scanner, or a cross-platform device that's not attached
                 to the device like a Bluetooth security key.

              AuthenticatorTransports -> (list)
                 Information  about  the transport methods of the passkey cre-
                 dential, for example USB or Bluetooth Low Energy.

                 (string)

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the item was created.  Amazon  Cognito
                 returns  this  timestamp  in UNIX epoch time format. Your SDK
                 might render the output in a human-readable format  like  ISO
                 8601 or a Java Date object.

       NextToken -> (string)
          An identifier that you can use in a later request to return the next
          set of items in the list.
