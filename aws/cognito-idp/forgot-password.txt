FORGOT-PASSWORD()                                            FORGOT-PASSWORD()



NAME
       forgot-password -

DESCRIPTION
       Calling  this  API  causes  a message to be sent to the end user with a
       confirmation code that is required to change the user's  password.  For
       the  Username  parameter,  you  can use the username or user alias. The
       method used to send the confirmation code  is  sent  according  to  the
       specified  AccountRecoverySetting. For more information, see Recovering
       User Accounts in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide . If neither a ver-
       ified  phone number nor a verified email exists, an InvalidParameterEx-
       ception is thrown. To use the confirmation code for resetting the pass-
       word, call ConfirmForgotPassword .

       NOTE:
          This  action  might  generate  an SMS text message. Starting June 1,
          2021, US telecom carriers require you  to  register  an  origination
          phone  number  before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers.
          If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register  a
          phone  number  with Amazon Pinpoint . Amazon Cognito uses the regis-
          tered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must
          receive  SMS  messages  might not be able to sign up, activate their
          accounts, or sign in.

          If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or  any
          other  Amazon  Web Service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might
          place your account in the SMS sandbox. In * sandbox mode * , you can
          send  messages  only  to verified phone numbers. After you test your
          app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the  sand-
          box  and into production. For more information, see SMS message set-
          tings for Amazon Cognito user pools in the Amazon Cognito  Developer
          Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            forgot-password
          --client-id <value>
          [--secret-hash <value>]
          [--user-context-data <value>]
          --username <value>
          [--analytics-metadata <value>]
          [--client-metadata <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-id (string)
          The ID of the client associated with the user pool.

       --secret-hash (string)
          A keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) calculated using the
          secret key of a user pool client and username plus the client ID  in
          the message.

       --user-context-data (structure)
          Contextual  data about your user session, such as the device finger-
          print, IP address, or location.  Amazon  Cognito  advanced  security
          evaluates  the  risk of an authentication event based on the context
          that your app generates and passes to Amazon Cognito when  it  makes
          API requests.

          IpAddress -> (string)
              The source IP address of your user's device.

          EncodedData -> (string)
              Encoded  device-fingerprint details that your app collected with
              the Amazon Cognito context data collection library. For more in-
              formation,  see  Adding  user device and session data to API re-
              quests .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          IpAddress=string,EncodedData=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "IpAddress": "string",
            "EncodedData": "string"
          }

       --username (string)
          The user name of the user for whom you want to enter a code to reset
          a forgotten password.

       --analytics-metadata (structure)
          The Amazon Pinpoint analytics metadata that contributes to your met-
          rics for ForgotPassword calls.

          AnalyticsEndpointId -> (string)
              The endpoint ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AnalyticsEndpointId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AnalyticsEndpointId": "string"
          }

       --client-metadata (map)
          A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide  as  input  for
          any custom workflows that this action triggers.

          You  create  custom  workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user
          pool triggers. When you use the ForgotPassword  API  action,  Amazon
          Cognito  invokes  any  functions  that are assigned to the following
          triggers: pre sign-up , custom message , and user migration  .  When
          Amazon Cognito invokes any of these functions, it passes a JSON pay-
          load, which the function receives as input. This payload contains  a
          clientMetadata  attribute, which provides the data that you assigned
          to the ClientMetadata parameter in your ForgotPassword  request.  In
          your  function  code  in  Lambda, you can process the clientMetadata
          value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

          For more information,  see  Customizing  user  pool  Workflows  with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              When  you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that Amazon
              Cognito won't do the following:

              o Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to
                Lambda  triggers  that  are assigned to a user pool to support
                custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't  in-
                clude  triggers,  the  ClientMetadata parameter serves no pur-
                pose.

              o Validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Encrypt the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito  to
                provide sensitive information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
