NAME
       describe-user-pool -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  configuration  information  and metadata of the specified
       user pool.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-user-pool
          --user-pool-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool you want to describe.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe a user pool

                     The attribute data type.

                 DeveloperOnlyAttribute -> (boolean)

                     NOTE:
                        You should use WriteAttributes in the user pool client
                        to control how attributes can be mutated for  new  use
                        cases instead of using DeveloperOnlyAttribute .

                     Specifies  whether  the attribute type is developer only.
                     This attribute can only be modified by an  administrator.
                     Users  won't be able to modify this attribute using their
                     access token. For example, DeveloperOnlyAttribute can  be
                     modified using AdminUpdateUserAttributes but can't be up-
                     dated using UpdateUserAttributes.

                 Mutable -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether the  value  of  the  attribute  can  be
                     changed.

                     For  any user pool attribute that is mapped to an IdP at-
                     tribute, you must set this parameter  to  true  .  Amazon
                     Cognito  updates  mapped attributes when users sign in to
                     your application through an IdP. If an attribute  is  im-
                     mutable,  Amazon Cognito throws an error when it attempts
                     to  update  the  attribute.  For  more  information,  see
                     Specifying  Identity Provider Attribute Mappings for Your
                     User Pool .

                 Required -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether a user pool attribute is  required.  If
                     the  attribute is required and the user doesn't provide a
                     value, registration or sign-in will fail.

                 NumberAttributeConstraints -> (structure)
                     Specifies the constraints for an attribute of the  number
                     type.

                     MinValue -> (string)
                        The  minimum value of an attribute that is of the num-
                        ber data type.

                     MaxValue -> (string)
                        The maximum value of an attribute that is of the  num-
                        ber data type.

                 StringAttributeConstraints -> (structure)
                     Specifies  the constraints for an attribute of the string
                     type.

                     MinLength -> (string)
                        The minimum length.

                 your users.

              EmailMessage -> (string)
                 The template for email messages that Amazon Cognito sends  to
                 your  users. You can set an EmailMessage template only if the
                 value  of  EmailSendingAccount  is  DEVELOPER  .  When   your
                 EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER , your user pool sends email
                 messages with your own Amazon SES configuration.

              EmailSubject -> (string)
                 The subject line for the email message template. You can  set
                 an    EmailSubject    template   only   if   the   value   of
                 EmailSendingAccount    is    DEVELOPER    .     When     your
                 EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER , your user pool sends email
                 messages with your own Amazon SES configuration.

              EmailMessageByLink -> (string)
                 The email message template for sending a confirmation link to
                 the  user. You can set an EmailMessageByLink template only if
                 the value of EmailSendingAccount is  DEVELOPER  .  When  your
                 EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER , your user pool sends email
                 messages with your own Amazon SES configuration.

              EmailSubjectByLink -> (string)
                 The subject line for the email message template for sending a
                 confirmation  link  to the user. You can set an EmailSubject-
                 ByLink template only if the value of  EmailSendingAccount  is
                 DEVELOPER . When your EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER , your
                 user pool sends email messages with your own Amazon SES  con-
                 figuration.

              DefaultEmailOption -> (string)
                 The default email option.

          SmsAuthenticationMessage -> (string)
              The contents of the SMS authentication message.

          UserAttributeUpdateSettings -> (structure)
              The  settings for updates to user attributes. These settings in-
              clude the property AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate , a
              user-pool  setting  that  tells  Amazon  Cognito  how  to handle
              changes to the value of your users' email address and phone num-
              ber  attributes.  For more information, see Verifying updates to
              email addresses and phone numbers .

              AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate -> (list)
                 Requires that your user verifies their email  address,  phone
                 number,  or  both  before Amazon Cognito updates the value of
                 that attribute. When you update a  user  attribute  that  has
                 this  option  activated,  Amazon Cognito sends a verification
                 message to the new phone number or email address. Amazon Cog-
                 nito doesnt change the value of the attribute until your user
                 responds to the verification message  and  confirms  the  new
                 value.

                 You  can verify an updated email address or phone number with
                 a VerifyUserAttribute API request.  You  can  also  call  the
                 UpdateUserAttributes or AdminUpdateUserAttributes API and set
                 email_verified or phone_number_verified to true.

                 When AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate is false, your
                 user  pool  doesn't  require that your users verify attribute
                 changes before Amazon Cognito updates them. In  a  user  pool
                 where AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate is false, API
                 operations that change attribute values can  immediately  up-
                 date a users email or phone_number attribute.

                 (string)

          MfaConfiguration -> (string)
              Can be one of the following values:

              o OFF - MFA tokens aren't required and can't be specified during
                user registration.

              o ON - MFA tokens are required for all user  registrations.  You
                can  only  specify  required  when you're initially creating a
                user pool.

              o OPTIONAL - Users have the option when registering to create an
                MFA token.

          DeviceConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  device-remembering  configuration  for  a user pool. A null
              value indicates that you have deactivated device remembering  in
              your user pool.

              NOTE:
                 When  you  provide a value for any DeviceConfiguration field,
                 you activate the Amazon Cognito device-remembering feature.

              ChallengeRequiredOnNewDevice -> (boolean)
                 When  true,  device  authentication  can  replace   SMS   and
                 time-based  one-time password (TOTP) factors for multi-factor
                 authentication (MFA).

                 NOTE:
                     Regardless of the value of this field, users that sign in
                     with  new  devices that have not been confirmed or remem-
                     bered must provide a second factor if your user pool  re-
                     quires MFA.

              DeviceOnlyRememberedOnUserPrompt -> (boolean)
                 When  true,  Amazon  Cognito doesn't remember newly-confirmed
                 devices. Users who want to authenticate with their device can
                 instead  opt  in  to  remembering  their device. To collect a
                 choice from your user, create an input prompt in your app and
                 return    the   value   that   the   user   chooses   in   an
                 UpdateDeviceStatus API request.

          EstimatedNumberOfUsers -> (integer)
              A number estimating the size of the user pool.

          EmailConfiguration -> (structure)
              The email configuration of your user pool. The email  configura-
              tion  type  sets  your preferred sending method, Amazon Web Ser-
              vices Region, and sender for messages tfrom your user pool.

              SourceArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of a verified email address  in  Amazon  SES.  Amazon
                 Cognito uses this email address in one of the following ways,
                 depending on the value that you specify for the  EmailSendin-
                 gAccount parameter:

                 o If  you  specify COGNITO_DEFAULT , Amazon Cognito uses this
                   address as the custom FROM  address  when  it  emails  your
                   users using its built-in email account.

                 o If you specify DEVELOPER , Amazon Cognito emails your users
                   with this address by calling Amazon SES on your behalf.

                 The Region value of the SourceArn parameter must  indicate  a
                 supported Amazon Web Services Region of your user pool. Typi-
                 cally, the Region in the SourceArn and the user  pool  Region
                 are the same. For more information, see Amazon SES email con-
                 figuration regions in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

              ReplyToEmailAddress -> (string)
                 The destination to which the receiver of the email should re-
                 ply.

              EmailSendingAccount -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether Amazon Cognito uses its built-in function-
                 ality to send your users email messages, or uses your  Amazon
                 Simple  Email Service email configuration. Specify one of the
                 following values:
                     COGNITO_DEFAULT

                 When Amazon Cognito emails your users, it uses  its  built-in
                 email  functionality. When you use the default option, Amazon
                 Cognito allows only a limited number of emails each  day  for
                 your  user pool. For typical production environments, the de-
                 fault email limit is less than the required delivery  volume.
                 To achieve a higher delivery volume, specify DEVELOPER to use
                 your Amazon SES email configuration.

                 To look up the email delivery limit for the  default  option,
                 see Limits in in the Developer Guide .

                 The  default FROM address is no-reply@verificationemail.com .
                 To customize the FROM address, provide  the  Amazon  Resource
                 Name  (ARN)  of  an Amazon SES verified email address for the
                 SourceArn parameter.
                     DEVELOPER

                 When Amazon Cognito emails your users, it  uses  your  Amazon
                 SES  configuration.  Amazon  Cognito calls Amazon SES on your
                 behalf to send email from your verified email  address.  When
                 you  use  this option, the email delivery limits are the same
                 limits that apply to your Amazon SES verified  email  address
                 in your Amazon Web Services account.

                 If you use this option, provide the ARN of an Amazon SES ver-
                 ified email address for the SourceArn parameter.

                 Before Amazon Cognito can email your users, it requires addi-
                 tional  permissions  to  call Amazon SES on your behalf. When
                 you update your user pool with this  option,  Amazon  Cognito
                 creates  a  service-linked role , which is a type of role, in
                 your Amazon Web Services account. This role contains the per-
                 missions  that allow to access Amazon SES and send email mes-
                 sages with your address. For more information about the  ser-
                 vice-linked  role that Amazon Cognito creates, see Using Ser-
                 vice-Linked Roles for Amazon Cognito in  the  Amazon  Cognito
                 Developer Guide .

              From -> (string)
                 Either  the  senders  email  address or the senders name with
                 their email address.  For  example,  testuser@example.com  or
                 Test  User  <testuser@example.com> . This address appears be-
                 fore the body of the email.

              ConfigurationSet -> (string)
                 The set of configuration rules that can be applied to  emails
                 sent  using  Amazon Simple Email Service. A configuration set
                 is applied to an email by including a reference to  the  con-
                 figuration set in the headers of the email. Once applied, all
                 of the rules in that configuration set  are  applied  to  the
                 email.  Configuration sets can be used to apply the following
                 types of rules to emails:
                     Event publishing

                 Amazon Simple Email Service can track the number of send, de-
                 livery,  open,  click,  bounce, and complaint events for each
                 email sent. Use event publishing to  send  information  about
                 these  events  to  other Amazon Web Services services such as
                 and Amazon CloudWatch
                     IP pool management

                 When leasing dedicated IP addresses with Amazon Simple  Email
                 Service,  you can create groups of IP addresses, called dedi-
                 cated IP pools. You can then associate the dedicated IP pools
                 with configuration sets.

          SmsConfiguration -> (structure)
              The SMS configuration with the settings that your Amazon Cognito
              user pool must use to send an SMS message from your  Amazon  Web
              Services  account through Amazon Simple Notification Service. To
              send SMS messages with Amazon SNS in the Amazon Web Services Re-
              gion  that  you want, the Amazon Cognito user pool uses an Iden-
              tity and Access Management (IAM) role in your  Amazon  Web  Ser-
              vices account.

              SnsCallerArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS caller. This
                 is the ARN of the IAM role in your Amazon  Web  Services  ac-
                 count  that Amazon Cognito will use to send SMS messages. SMS
                 messages are subject to a spending limit .

              ExternalId -> (string)
                 The external ID provides additional  security  for  your  IAM
                 role.  You  can  use an ExternalId with the IAM role that you
                 use with Amazon SNS to send SMS messages for your user  pool.
                 If  you provide an ExternalId , your Amazon Cognito user pool
                 includes it in the request to assume your IAM role.  You  can
                 configure  the  role trust policy to require that Amazon Cog-
                 nito, and any principal, provide the ExternalID . If you  use
                 the  Amazon  Cognito  Management Console to create a role for
                 SMS multi-factor authentication (MFA), Amazon Cognito creates
                 a  role with the required permissions and a trust policy that
                 demonstrates use of the ExternalId .

                 For more information about the ExternalId of a role, see  How
                 to use an external ID when granting access to your Amazon Web
                 Services resources to a third party

              SnsRegion -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region to use with Amazon  SNS  inte-
                 gration. You can choose the same Region as your user pool, or
                 a supported Legacy Amazon SNS alternate Region .

                 Amazon Cognito resources in the Asia Pacific  (Seoul)  Amazon
                 Web Services Region must use your Amazon SNS configuration in
                 the Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Region. For  more  information,  see
                 SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools .

          UserPoolTags -> (map)
              The  tags  that  are assigned to the user pool. A tag is a label
              that you can apply to user pools to categorize and  manage  them
              in  different  ways,  such as by purpose, owner, environment, or
              other criteria.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          SmsConfigurationFailure -> (string)
              The reason why the SMS configuration can't send the messages  to
              your users.

              This  message  might  include comma-separated values to describe
              why your SMS configuration can't send messages to user pool  end
              users.
                 InvalidSmsRoleAccessPolicyException

              The Identity and Access Management role that Amazon Cognito uses
              to send SMS messages isn't properly configured. For more  infor-
              mation, see SmsConfigurationType .
                 SNSSandbox

              The  Amazon  Web  Services account is in the SNS SMS Sandbox and
              messages will only reach verified end users. This parameter wont
              get  populated with SNSSandbox if the IAM user creating the user
              pool doesnt have SNS permissions. To learn how to move your Ama-
              zon  Web  Services account out of the sandbox, see Moving out of
              the SMS sandbox .

          EmailConfigurationFailure -> (string)
              Deprecated.  Review  error  codes   from   API   requests   with
              EventSource:cognito-idp.amazonaws.com in CloudTrail for informa-
              tion about problems with user pool email configuration.

          Domain -> (string)
              The domain prefix, if the user pool has a domain associated with
              it.

          CustomDomain -> (string)
              A  custom  domain  name that you provide to Amazon Cognito. This
              parameter applies only if you use a custom domain  to  host  the
              sign-up  and sign-in pages for your application. An example of a
              custom domain name might be auth.example.com .

              For more information about adding a custom domain to  your  user
              pool, see Using Your Own Domain for the Hosted UI .

          AdminCreateUserConfig -> (structure)
              The configuration for AdminCreateUser requests.

              AllowAdminCreateUserOnly -> (boolean)
                 Set  to  True  if only the administrator is allowed to create
                 user profiles. Set to False if users can sign  themselves  up
                 via an app.

              UnusedAccountValidityDays -> (integer)
                 The user account expiration limit, in days, after which a new
                 account that hasn't signed in is no longer usable.  To  reset
                 the  account  after that time limit, you must call AdminCrea-
                 teUser again, specifying "RESEND" for the  MessageAction  pa-
                 rameter. The default value for this parameter is 7.

                 NOTE:
                     If  you  set a value for TemporaryPasswordValidityDays in
                     PasswordPolicy , that value will be used,  and  UnusedAc-
                     countValidityDays  will  be no longer be an available pa-
                     rameter for that user pool.

              InviteMessageTemplate -> (structure)
                 The message template to be used for the  welcome  message  to
                 new users.

                 See also Customizing User Invitation Messages .

                 SMSMessage -> (string)
                     The message template for SMS messages.

                 EmailMessage -> (string)
                     The  message template for email messages. EmailMessage is
                     allowed only if EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER.

                 EmailSubject -> (string)
                     The subject line for email messages. EmailSubject is  al-
                     lowed only if EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER.

          UserPoolAddOns -> (structure)
              The user pool add-ons.

              AdvancedSecurityMode -> (string)
                 The advanced security mode.

          UsernameConfiguration -> (structure)
              Case  sensitivity of the username input for the selected sign-in
              option. For example, when case sensitivity is  set  to  False  ,
              users  can  sign  in using either "username" or "Username". This
              configuration is immutable once it has been set. For more infor-
              mation, see UsernameConfigurationType .

              CaseSensitive -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether user name case sensitivity will be applied
                 for all users in the user pool through Amazon Cognito APIs.

                 Valid values include:
                     True

                 Enables case sensitivity for all username  input.  When  this
                 option  is  set  to True , users must sign in using the exact
                 capitalization of their given  username,  such  as  UserName.
                 This is the default value.
                     False

                 Enables  case insensitivity for all username input. For exam-
                 ple, when this option is set to False , users can sign in us-
                 ing either "username" or "Username". This option also enables
                 both preferred_username and email alias to be  case  insensi-
                 tive, in addition to the username attribute.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the user pool.

          AccountRecoverySetting -> (structure)
              The  available  verified  method a user can use to recover their
              password when they call ForgotPassword . You can use  this  set-
              ting  to define a preferred method when a user has more than one
              method available. With this setting, SMS doesn't qualify  for  a
              valid  password  recovery  mechanism  if  the  user also has SMS
              multi-factor authentication (MFA) activated. In the  absence  of
              this  setting, Amazon Cognito uses the legacy behavior to deter-
              mine the recovery method where SMS is preferred through email.

              RecoveryMechanisms -> (list)
                 The list of RecoveryOptionTypes .

                 (structure)
                     A map containing a priority as a key, and recovery method
                     name as a value.

                     Priority -> (integer)
                        A  positive  integer  specifying  priority of a method
                        with 1 being the highest priority.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The recovery method for a user.
