OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)

          for a user pool.

              LogLevel -> (string)
                 The errorlevel selection of logs that a user pool  sends  for
                 detailed activity logging.

              EventSource -> (string)
                 The  source  of events that your user pool sends for detailed
                 activity logging.

              CloudWatchLogsConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The CloudWatch logging destination of a user pool.

                 LogGroupArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (arn) of a CloudWatch  Logs  log
                     group where your user pool sends logs. The log group must
                     not be encrypted with Key Management Service and must  be

       Shorthand Syntax:

          LogLevel=string,EventSource=string,CloudWatchLogsConfiguration={LogGroupArn=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "LogLevel": "ERROR",
              "EventSource": "userNotification",
              "CloudWatchLogsConfiguration": {
                "LogGroupArn": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not

       the string will be taken literally.

       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
