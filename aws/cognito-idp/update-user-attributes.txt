UPDATE-USER-ATTRIBUTES()                              UPDATE-USER-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       update-user-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Allows a user to update a specific attribute (one at a time).

       NOTE:
          This  action  might  generate  an SMS text message. Starting June 1,
          2021, US telecom carriers require you  to  register  an  origination
          phone  number  before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers.
          If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register  a
          phone  number  with Amazon Pinpoint . Amazon Cognito uses the regis-
          tered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must
          receive  SMS  messages  might not be able to sign up, activate their
          accounts, or sign in.

          If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or  any
          other  Amazon  Web Service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might
          place your account in the SMS sandbox. In * sandbox mode * , you can
          send  messages  only  to verified phone numbers. After you test your
          app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the  sand-
          box  and into production. For more information, see SMS message set-
          tings for Amazon Cognito user pools in the Amazon Cognito  Developer
          Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            update-user-attributes
          --user-attributes <value>
          --access-token <value>
          [--client-metadata <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-attributes (list)
          An array of name-value pairs representing user attributes.

          For  custom  attributes,  you must prepend the custom: prefix to the
          attribute name.

          (structure)
              Specifies whether the attribute is standard or custom.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the attribute.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the attribute.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --access-token (string)
          The access token for the request to update user attributes.

       --client-metadata (map)
          A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide  as  input  for
          any custom workflows that this action initiates.

          You  create  custom  workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user
          pool triggers. When you use  the  UpdateUserAttributes  API  action,
          Amazon  Cognito  invokes the function that is assigned to the custom
          message trigger. When  Amazon  Cognito  invokes  this  function,  it
          passes  a  JSON  payload, which the function receives as input. This
          payload contains a clientMetadata attribute, which provides the data
          that  you  assigned  to  the  ClientMetadata parameter in your Upda-
          teUserAttributes request. In your function code in Lambda,  you  can
          process  the  clientMetadata value to enhance your workflow for your
          specific needs.

          For more information,  see  Customizing  user  pool  Workflows  with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              When  you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that Amazon
              Cognito won't do the following:

              o Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to
                Lambda  triggers  that  are assigned to a user pool to support
                custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't  in-
                clude  triggers,  the  ClientMetadata parameter serves no pur-
                pose.

              o Validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Encrypt the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito  to
                provide sensitive information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
