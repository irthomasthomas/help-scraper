ADMIN-LINK-PROVIDER-FOR-USER()                  ADMIN-LINK-PROVIDER-FOR-USER()



NAME
       admin-link-provider-for-user -

DESCRIPTION
       Links  an existing user account in a user pool (DestinationUser ) to an
       identity from an external IdP (SourceUser ) based on a specified attri-
       bute  name and value from the external IdP. This allows you to create a
       link from the existing user account to an external federated user iden-
       tity that has not yet been used to sign in. You can then use the feder-
       ated user identity to sign in as the existing user account.

       For example, if there is an existing user with a username and password,
       this  API  links  that user to a federated user identity. When the user
       signs in with a federated user identity, they sign in as  the  existing
       user account.

       NOTE:
          The maximum number of federated identities linked to a user is five.

       WARNING:
          Because  this  API allows a user with an external federated identity
          to sign in as an existing user in the user pool, it is critical that
          it only be used with external IdPs and provider attributes that have
          been trusted by the application owner.

       NOTE:
          Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM)  poli-
          cies  in  requests  for  this API operation. For this operation, you
          must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you  must  grant
          yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool.

       --destination-user (structure)
          The  existing  user  in the user pool that you want to assign to the
          external IdP user account. This user can  be  a  local  (Username  +
          Password)  Amazon  Cognito  user pools user or a federated user (for
          example, a SAML or Facebook user). If the user doesn't exist, Amazon
          Cognito  generates  an  exception.  Amazon Cognito returns this user
          when the new user (with the linked IdP attribute) signs in.

          For a native username + password  user,  the  ProviderAttributeValue
          for the DestinationUser should be the username in the user pool. For
          a federated user, it should be the provider-specific user_id .

          The ProviderAttributeName of the DestinationUser is ignored.

          The ProviderName should be set to Cognito for users in Cognito  user
          pools.

          WARNING:
              All  attributes  in the DestinationUser profile must be mutable.
              If you have assigned the user any immutable  custom  attributes,
              the operation won't succeed.

          ProviderName -> (string)
              The  name  of  the  provider, such as Facebook, Google, or Login
              with Amazon.

          ProviderAttributeName -> (string)
              The name of the provider attribute to link to, such as NameID .

          ProviderAttributeValue -> (string)
              The value  of  the  provider  attribute  to  link  to,  such  as
              xxxxx_account .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ProviderName=string,ProviderAttributeName=string,ProviderAttributeValue=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ProviderName": "string",
            "ProviderAttributeName": "string",
            "ProviderAttributeValue": "string"
          }

       --source-user (structure)
          An external IdP account for a user who doesn't exist yet in the user
          pool. This user must be a federated user (for  example,  a  SAML  or
          Facebook user), not another native user.

          If the SourceUser is using a federated social IdP, such as Facebook,
          Google, or Login with Amazon, you must set the ProviderAttributeName
          to Cognito_Subject . For social IdPs, the ProviderName will be Face-
          book , Google , or LoginWithAmazon , and Amazon Cognito  will  auto-
          matically  parse  the Facebook, Google, and Login with Amazon tokens
          for id , sub , and user_id ,  respectively.  The  ProviderAttribute-
          Value  for  the  user  must  be  the same value as the id , sub , or
          user_id value found in the social IdP token.

          For OIDC, the ProviderAttributeName can be any value that matches  a
          claim  in the ID token, or that your app retrieves from the userInfo
          endpoint. You must map the claim to a user pool  attribute  in  your
          IdP configuration, and set the user pool attribute name as the value
          of ProviderAttributeName in your AdminLinkProviderForUser request.

          For SAML, the ProviderAttributeName can be any value that matches  a
          claim in the SAML assertion. To link SAML users based on the subject
          of the SAML assertion, map the subject to a claim through  the  SAML
          IdP and set that claim name as the value of ProviderAttributeName in
          your AdminLinkProviderForUser request.

          For both OIDC and SAML users, when you set ProviderAttributeName  to
          Cognito_Subject  ,  Amazon  Cognito will automatically parse the de-
          fault unique identifier found in the subject from the IdP token.

          ProviderName -> (string)
              The name of the provider, such as  Facebook,  Google,  or  Login
              with Amazon.

          ProviderAttributeName -> (string)
              The name of the provider attribute to link to, such as NameID .

          ProviderAttributeValue -> (string)
              The  value  of  the  provider  attribute  to  link  to,  such as
              xxxxx_account .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ProviderName=string,ProviderAttributeName=string,ProviderAttributeValue=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ProviderName": "string",
            "ProviderAttributeName": "string",
            "ProviderAttributeValue": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
