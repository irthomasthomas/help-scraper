ADMIN-LINK-PROVIDER-FOR-USER()                  ADMIN-LINK-PROVIDER-FOR-USER()



NAME
       admin-link-provider-for-user -

DESCRIPTION
       Links  an existing user account in a user pool (DestinationUser ) to an
       identity from an external identity provider (SourceUser )  based  on  a
       specified attribute name and value from the external identity provider.
       This allows you to create a link from the existing user account  to  an
       external federated user identity that has not yet been used to sign in.
       You can then use the federated user identity to sign in as the existing
       user account.

       For example, if there is an existing user with a username and password,
       this API links that user to a federated user identity.  When  the  user
       signs  in  with a federated user identity, they sign in as the existing
       user account.

       NOTE:
          The maximum number of federated identities linked to a user is 5.

       WARNING:
          Because this API allows a user with an external  federated  identity
          to sign in as an existing user in the user pool, it is critical that
          it only be used with external identity providers  and  provider  at-
          tributes that have been trusted by the application owner.

       This action is administrative and requires developer credentials.

SYNOPSIS
            admin-link-provider-for-user
          --user-pool-id <value>
          --destination-user <value>
          --source-user <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool.

       --destination-user (structure)
          The  existing  user  in the user pool that you want to assign to the
          external identity provider user account. This user can be  a  native
          (Username  + Password) Amazon Cognito user pools user or a federated
          user (for example, a SAML or Facebook user). If the user doesn't ex-
          ist,  Amazon  Cognito generates an exception. Amazon Cognito returns
          this user when the new user (with the linked identity  provider  at-
          tribute) signs in.

          For  a  native  username + password user, the ProviderAttributeValue
          for the DestinationUser should be the username in the user pool. For
          a federated user, it should be the provider-specific user_id .

          The ProviderAttributeName of the DestinationUser is ignored.

          The  ProviderName should be set to Cognito for users in Cognito user
          pools.

          WARNING:
              All attributes in the DestinationUser profile must  be  mutable.
              If  you  have assigned the user any immutable custom attributes,
              the operation won't succeed.

          ProviderName -> (string)
              The name of the provider, such as  Facebook,  Google,  or  Login
              with Amazon.

          ProviderAttributeName -> (string)
              The name of the provider attribute to link to, such as NameID .

          ProviderAttributeValue -> (string)
              The  value  of  the  provider  attribute  to  link  to,  such as
              xxxxx_account .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ProviderName=string,ProviderAttributeName=string,ProviderAttributeValue=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ProviderName": "string",
            "ProviderAttributeName": "string",
            "ProviderAttributeValue": "string"
          }

       --source-user (structure)
          An external identity provider account for a user who  doesn't  exist
          yet  in the user pool. This user must be a federated user (for exam-
          ple, a SAML or Facebook user), not another native user.

          If the SourceUser is using a  federated  social  identity  provider,
          such  as  Facebook,  Google,  or Login with Amazon, you must set the
          ProviderAttributeName  to  Cognito_Subject  .  For  social  identity
          providers,  the  ProviderName  will be Facebook , Google , or Login-
          WithAmazon , and Amazon Cognito will automatically parse  the  Face-
          book,  Google,  and  Login  with  Amazon  tokens  for id , sub , and
          user_id , respectively. The ProviderAttributeValue for the user must
          be  the  same  value as the id , sub , or user_id value found in the
          social identity provider token.

          For SAML, the ProviderAttributeName can be any value that matches  a
          claim in the SAML assertion. If you want to link SAML users based on
          the subject of the SAML assertion, you should map the subject  to  a
          claim  through the SAML identity provider and submit that claim name
          as the ProviderAttributeName . If you set  ProviderAttributeName  to
          Cognito_Subject  ,  Amazon  Cognito will automatically parse the de-
          fault unique identifier found in the subject from the SAML token.

          ProviderName -> (string)
              The name of the provider, such as  Facebook,  Google,  or  Login
              with Amazon.

          ProviderAttributeName -> (string)
              The name of the provider attribute to link to, such as NameID .

          ProviderAttributeValue -> (string)
              The  value  of  the  provider  attribute  to  link  to,  such as
              xxxxx_account .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ProviderName=string,ProviderAttributeName=string,ProviderAttributeValue=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ProviderName": "string",
            "ProviderAttributeName": "string",
            "ProviderAttributeValue": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
