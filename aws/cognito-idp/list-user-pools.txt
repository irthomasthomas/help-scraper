NAME
       list-user-pools -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the user pools associated with an Amazon Web Services account.

       NOTE:
          Amazon  Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) poli-
          cies in requests for this API operation.  For  this  operation,  you
          must  use  IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant
          yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

       list-user-pools is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: UserPools

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list user pools

       This example lists up to 20 user pools.

       Command:

          aws cognito-idp list-user-pools --max-results 20

       Output:

          {
            "UserPools": [
                {
                   "CreationDate": 1547763720.822,
                   "LastModifiedDate": 1547763720.822,
                   "LambdaConfig": {},
                   "Id": "us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa",
                   "Name": "MyUserPool"
                }
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       UserPools -> (list)
          The user pools from the response to list users.

          (structure)
              A short description of a user pool.

              This data type is a response parameter of ListUserPools .

              Id -> (string)
                 The user pool ID.

              Name -> (string)
                 The user pool name.

              LambdaConfig -> (structure)
                 A collection of user pool Lambda triggers. Amazon Cognito in-
                 vokes triggers at several possible stages of user pool opera-
                 tions. Triggers can modify the outcome of the operations that
                 invoked them.

                 PreSignUp -> (string)
                     The configuration of a pre sign-up Lambda  trigger  in  a
                     user  pool.  This trigger evaluates new users and can by-
                     pass confirmation, link a federated  user  profile  ,  or
                     block sign-up requests.

                 CustomMessage -> (string)
                     A  custom  message Lambda trigger. This trigger is an op-
                     portunity to customize all SMS and  email  messages  from
                     your  user pool. When a custom message trigger is active,
                     your user pool routes all messages to a  Lambda  function
                     that  returns  a  runtime-customized  message subject and
                     body for your user pool to deliver to a user.

                 PostConfirmation -> (string)
                     The configuration of a post confirmation  Lambda  trigger
                     in  a user pool. This trigger can take custom actions af-
                     ter a user confirms their user account  and  their  email
                     address or phone number.

                 PreAuthentication -> (string)
                     The  configuration  of  a pre authentication trigger in a
                     user pool. This trigger  can  evaluate  and  modify  user
                     sign-in events.

                 PostAuthentication -> (string)
                     The configuration of a post authentication Lambda trigger
                     in a user pool. This trigger can take custom actions  af-
                     ter a user signs in.

                 DefineAuthChallenge -> (string)
                     The configuration of a define auth challenge Lambda trig-
                     ger, one of three triggers in the sequence of the  custom
                     authentication challenge triggers .

                 CreateAuthChallenge -> (string)
                     The configuration of a create auth challenge Lambda trig-
                     ger, one of three triggers in the sequence of the  custom
                     authentication challenge triggers .

                 VerifyAuthChallengeResponse -> (string)
                     The configuration of a verify auth challenge Lambda trig-
                     ger, one of three triggers in the sequence of the  custom
                     authentication challenge triggers .

                 PreTokenGeneration -> (string)
                     The legacy configuration of a pre token generation Lambda
                     trigger in a user pool.

                     Set this parameter for legacy purposes. If you  also  set
                     an  ARN  in  PreTokenGenerationConfig , its value must be
                     identical to PreTokenGeneration . For  new  instances  of
                     pre  token generation triggers, set the LambdaArn of Pre-
                     TokenGenerationConfig .

                 UserMigration -> (string)
                     The configuration of a migrate user Lambda trigger  in  a
                     user  pool.  This  trigger  can create user profiles when
                     users sign in or attempt to  reset  their  password  with
                     credentials that don't exist yet.

                 PreTokenGenerationConfig -> (structure)
                     The  detailed  configuration  of  a  pre token generation
                     Lambda trigger in a user pool. If you also set an ARN  in
                     PreTokenGeneration  , its value must be identical to Pre-
                     TokenGenerationConfig .

                     LambdaVersion -> (string)
                        The user pool trigger version of the request that Ama-
                        zon Cognito sends to your Lambda function. Higher-num-
                        bered versions add fields that support new features.

                     LambdaArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  function  that
                        you want to assign to your Lambda trigger.

                        This  parameter and the PreTokenGeneration property of
                        LambdaConfig have the same value. For new instances of
                        pre token generation triggers, set LambdaArn .

                 CustomSMSSender -> (structure)
                     The  configuration of a custom SMS sender Lambda trigger.
                     This trigger routes all SMS  notifications  from  a  user
                     pool to a Lambda function that delivers the message using
                     custom logic.

                     LambdaVersion -> (string)
                        The user pool trigger version of the request that Ama-
                        zon Cognito sends to your Lambda function. Higher-num-
                        bered versions add fields that support new features.

                        You must use a LambdaVersion of  V1_0  with  a  custom
                        sender function.

                     LambdaArn -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the function that
                        you want to assign to your Lambda trigger.

                 CustomEmailSender -> (structure)
                     The configuration of a custom email sender  Lambda  trig-
                     ger.  This  trigger routes all email notifications from a
                     user pool to a Lambda function that delivers the  message
                     using custom logic.

                     LambdaVersion -> (string)
                        The user pool trigger version of the request that Ama-
                        zon Cognito sends to your Lambda function. Higher-num-
                        bered versions add fields that support new features.

                        You  must  use  a  LambdaVersion of V1_0 with a custom
                        sender function.

                     LambdaArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  function  that
                        you want to assign to your Lambda trigger.

                 KMSKeyID -> (string)
                     The  ARN  of  an KMS key . Amazon Cognito uses the key to
                     encrypt codes and  temporary  passwords  sent  to  custom
                     sender Lambda triggers.

              Status -> (string)
                 The user pool status.

              LastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time when the item was modified. Amazon Cognito
                 returns this timestamp in UNIX epoch time  format.  Your  SDK
                 might  render  the output in a human-readable format like ISO
                 8601 or a Java Date object.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the item was created.  Amazon  Cognito
                 returns  this  timestamp  in UNIX epoch time format. Your SDK
                 might render the output in a human-readable format  like  ISO
                 8601 or a Java Date object.

       NextToken -> (string)
          An identifier that was returned from the previous call to this oper-
          ation, which can be used to return the next  set  of  items  in  the
          list.
