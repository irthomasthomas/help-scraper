SIGN-UP()                                                            SIGN-UP()



NAME
       sign-up -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers  the user in the specified user pool and creates a user name,
       password, and user attributes.

       NOTE:
          This action might generate an SMS text  message.  Starting  June  1,
          2021,  US  telecom  carriers  require you to register an origination
          phone number before you can send SMS messages to US  phone  numbers.
          If  you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a
          phone number with Amazon Pinpoint . Amazon Cognito uses  the  regis-
          tered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must
          receive SMS messages might not be able to sign  up,  activate  their
          accounts, or sign in.

          If  you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any
          other Amazon Web Service, Amazon Simple Notification  Service  might
          place your account in the SMS sandbox. In * sandbox mode * , you can
          send messages only to verified phone numbers. After  you  test  your
          app  while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sand-
          box and into production. For more information, see SMS message  set-
          tings  for Amazon Cognito user pools in the Amazon Cognito Developer
          Guide .

       --client-metadata (map)
          A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide  as  input  for
          any custom workflows that this action triggers.

          You  create  custom  workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user
          pool triggers. When you use the SignUp API  action,  Amazon  Cognito
          invokes  any  functions that are assigned to the following triggers:
          pre sign-up , custom message , and post confirmation .  When  Amazon
          Cognito  invokes  any  of these functions, it passes a JSON payload,
          which the function  receives  as  input.  This  payload  contains  a
          clientMetadata  attribute, which provides the data that you assigned
          to the ClientMetadata parameter in  your  SignUp  request.  In  your
          function code in Lambda, you can process the clientMetadata value to
          enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

          For more information,  see  Customizing  user  pool  Workflows  with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              When  you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that Amazon
              Cognito won't do the following:

              o Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to
                Lambda  triggers  that  are assigned to a user pool to support
                custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't  in-
                clude  triggers,  the  ClientMetadata parameter serves no pur-
                pose.

              o Validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Encrypt the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito  to
                provide sensitive information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
