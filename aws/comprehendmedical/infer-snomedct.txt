INFER-SNOMEDCT()                                              INFER-SNOMEDCT()



NAME
       infer-snomedct -

DESCRIPTION
       InferSNOMEDCT  detects  possible medical concepts as entities and links
       them to codes from the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine,  Clinical
       Terms (SNOMED-CT) ontology

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            infer-snomedct
          --text <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --text (string)
          The  input  text to be analyzed using InferSNOMEDCT. The text should
          be a string with 1 to 10000 characters.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example: To detect entities and link to the SNOMED CT Ontology directly
       from text

       The following infer-snomedct example shows how to detect medical  enti-
       ties  and link them to concepts from the 2021-03 version of the System-
       atized Nomenclature of Medicine, Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT).

          aws comprehendmedical infer-snomedct \
              --text "The patient complains of abdominal pain, has a long-standing history of diabetes treated with Micronase daily."

OUTPUT
       Entities -> (list)
          The  collection of medical concept entities extracted from the input
          text and their associated information. For each entity, the response
          provides the entity text, the entity category, where the entity text
          begins and ends, and the level of confidence that Comprehend Medical
          has  in the detection and analysis. Attributes and traits of the en-
          tity are also returned.

          (structure)
              The collection of medical entities extracted from the input text
              and  their associated information. For each entity, the response
              provides the entity text, the entity category, where the  entity
              text  begins  and ends, and the level of confidence that Compre-
              hend Medical has in the detection and analysis.  Attributes  and
              traits of the entity are also returned.

              Id -> (integer)
                 The  numeric  identifier  for the entity. This is a monotoni-
                 cally increasing id unique within this response rather than a

              Text -> (string)
                 The segment of input text extracted as this entity.

              Category -> (string)
                 The  category of the detected entity. Possible categories are
                 MEDICAL_CONDITION, ANATOMY, or TEST_TREATMENT_PROCEDURE.

                 ties. Possible types include DX_NAME, ACUITY, DIRECTION, SYS-
                 TEM_ORGAN_SITE,  TEST_NAME,  TEST_VALUE,  TEST_UNIT,   PROCE-

                 The  level  of  confidence that Comprehend Medical has in the
                 accuracy of the detected entity.

              BeginOffset -> (integer)
                 The 0-based character offset in the  input  text  that  shows
                 where  the  entity  begins. The offset returns the UTF-8 code
                 point in the string.

              EndOffset -> (integer)
                 The 0-based character offset in the  input  text  that  shows
                 where  the  entity  ends.  The  offset returns the UTF-8 code
                 point in the string.

              Attributes -> (list)
                 An extracted segment of the text that is an attribute  of  an
                 entity, or otherwise related to an entity, such as the dosage
                 of a medication taken.

                 (structure)
                     The extracted attributes that relate to an entity. An ex-
                     tracted  segment  of  the text that is an attribute of an
                     entity, or otherwise related to an entity,  such  as  the
                     dosage of a medication taken.

                     Category -> (string)
                        The category of the detected attribute. Possible cate-

                        TEST_TREATMENT_PROCEDURE.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The type of attribute. Possible types include DX_NAME,

                        attribute.

                     RelationshipScore -> (float)
                        The level of confidence that  Comprehend  Medical  has
                        that  this  attribute is correctly related to this en-
                        tity.

                     RelationshipType -> (string)
                        The type of relationship that exists between  the  en-
                        tity and the related attribute.

                     Id -> (integer)
                        The  numeric  identifier for this attribute. This is a
                        monotonically increasing id  unique  within  this  re-
                        sponse rather than a global unique identifier.

                     BeginOffset -> (integer)
                        The  0-based  character  offset in the input text that
                        shows where the attribute begins. The  offset  returns
                        the UTF-8 code point in the string.

                     EndOffset -> (integer)
                        The  0-based  character  offset in the input text that
                        shows where the attribute ends. The offset returns the
                        UTF-8 code point in the string.

                     Text -> (string)
