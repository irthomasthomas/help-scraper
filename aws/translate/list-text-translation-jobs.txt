OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          The  parameters  that  specify  which  batch translation jobs to re-
          trieve. Filters include job name, job status, and  submission  time.
          You can only set one filter at a time.

          JobName -> (string)
              Filters the list of jobs by name.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              Filters the list of jobs based by job status.

          SubmittedBeforeTime -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted for processing and returns only the jobs submitted before
              the specified time. Jobs are returned in ascending order, oldest
              to newest.

          SubmittedAfterTime -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted  for processing and returns only the jobs submitted after
              the specified time. Jobs are returned in descending order,  new-
              est to oldest.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          JobName=string,JobStatus=string,SubmittedBeforeTime=timestamp,SubmittedAfterTime=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "JobName": "string",
            "JobStatus": "SUBMITTED"|"IN_PROGRESS"|"COMPLETED"|"COMPLETED_WITH_ERROR"|"FAILED"|"STOP_REQUESTED"|"STOPPED",
            "SubmittedBeforeTime": timestamp,
            "SubmittedAfterTime": timestamp
          }

       --next-token (string)
          The token to request the next page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of results to return in each page. The default
          value is 100.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                     files.  Amazon  Translate translates all the files in the

                     same Region as the API endpoint you are calling.

                 ContentType -> (string)
                     Describes  the format of the data that you submit to Ama-
                     zon Translate as input. You can specify one of  the  fol-
                     lowing multipurpose internet mail extension (MIME) types:

                     o text/html : The input data consists of one or more HTML
                       files. Amazon Translate translates only the  text  that
                       resides in the html element in each file.

                     o text/plain : The input data consists of one or more un-
                       formatted text files. Amazon Translate translates every
                       character in this type of input.

                     o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordpro-
                       cessingml.document : The input data consists of one  or
                       more Word documents (.docx).

                     o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presenta-
                       tionml.presentation : The input data consists of one or
                       more PowerPoint Presentation files (.pptx).

                     o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spread-
                       sheetml.sheet : The input data consists of one or  more
                       Excel Workbook files (.xlsx).

                     o application/x-xliff+xml  :  The  input data consists of
                       one or more XML Localization  Interchange  File  Format
                       (XLIFF)  files  (.xlf).  Amazon Translate supports only
                       XLIFF version 1.2.

                     WARNING:
                        If you structure your input data as HTML, ensure  that
                        you set this parameter to text/html . By doing so, you
                        cut costs by limiting the translation to the  contents
                        of  the  html  element in each file. Otherwise, if you
                        set this parameter to text/plain  ,  your  costs  will
                        cover the translation of every character.

              OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The  output configuration properties that were specified when
                 the job was requested.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     The URI of the S3  folder  that  contains  a  translation
                     job's  output file. The folder must be in the same Region
                     as the API endpoint that you are calling.

                 EncryptionKey -> (structure)
                     The encryption key used to encrypt this object.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The type of encryption key used by Amazon Translate to
                        encrypt this object.

                     Id -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the encryption key
                        being used to encrypt this object.

              DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity Access  and
                 Management  (IAM) role that granted Amazon Translate read ac-
                 cess to the job's input data.

              Settings -> (structure)
                 Settings that configure the translation output.

                 Formality -> (string)
                     You can optionally specify the desired level of formality
                     for  translations to supported target languages. The for-
                     mality setting controls the level of formal language  us-
                     age  (also known as register ) in the translation output.
                     You can set the value to informal or formal. If you don't
                     specify  a value for formality, or if the target language
                     doesn't support formality, the  translation  will  ignore
                     the formality setting.

                     If  you  specify  multiple  target languages for the job,
                     translate ignores the formality setting  for  any  unsup-
                     ported target language.

                     For  a  list  of target languages that support formality,
                     see Supported languages in the Amazon Translate Developer
                     Guide.

                 Profanity -> (string)
                     Enable the profanity setting if you want Amazon Translate
                     to mask profane words and  phrases  in  your  translation
                     output.

                     To  mask  profane words and phrases, Amazon Translate re-
                     places them with the grawlix string ?$#@$. This 5-charac-
                     ter sequence is used for each profane word or phrase, re-
                     gardless of the length or number of words.

                     Amazon Translate doesn't detect profanity in all  of  its
                     supported  languages.  For  languages  that don't support
                     profanity detection, see  Unsupported  languages  in  the
                     Amazon Translate Developer Guide.

                     If you specify multiple target languages for the job, all
                     the target languages must support profanity  masking.  If
                     any of the target languages don't support profanity mask-
                     ing, the translation job won't  mask  profanity  for  any
                     target language.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
