TRANSLATE-DOCUMENT()                                      TRANSLATE-DOCUMENT()



NAME
       translate-document -

DESCRIPTION
       Translates  the  input  document from the source language to the target
       language. This synchronous operation supports plain text  or  HTML  for
       the  input  document. TranslateDocument supports translations from Eng-
       lish to any supported language, and from any supported language to Eng-
       lish.  Therefore, specify either the source language code or the target
       language code as en (English).
          TranslateDocument does not support language auto-detection.

       If you set the Formality parameter, the request will fail if the target
       language  does  not  support  formality. For a list of target languages
       that support formality, see Setting formality .

OPTIONS
       --document (structure)
          The content and content type for the document to be translated.  The
          document size must not exceed 100 KB.

          ContentType -> (string)
              Describes the format of the document. You can specify one of the
              following:

              o text/html - The input data consists of  HTML  content.  Amazon
                Translate translates only the text in the HTML element.

              o text/plain - The input data consists of unformatted text. Ama-
                zon Translate translates every character in the content.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ContentType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ContentType": "string"
          }

       --terminology-names (list)
          The name of a terminology list file to add to the  translation  job.
          This file provides source terms and the desired translation for each
          term. A terminology list can contain a maximum of 256 terms. You can
          use one custom terminology resource in your translation request.

          Use  the  ListTerminologies operation to get the available terminol-
          ogy lists.

          For more information about custom terminology lists, see Custom ter-
          minology .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --source-language-code (string)
          The  language  code  for the language of the source text. Do not use
          auto , because TranslateDocument does not support language  auto-de-
          tection.  For a list of supported language codes, see Supported lan-
          guages .

       --target-language-code (string)
          The language code requested for the translated document. For a  list
          of supported language codes, see Supported languages .

       --settings (structure)
          Settings  to configure your translation output, including the option
          to set the formality level of the output text and the option to mask
          profane words and phrases.

          Formality -> (string)
              You  can  optionally  specify the desired level of formality for
              translations to supported target languages. The  formality  set-
              ting  controls the level of formal language usage (also known as
              register ) in the translation output. You can set the  value  to
              informal  or formal. If you don't specify a value for formality,
              or if the target language doesn't support formality, the  trans-
              lation will ignore the formality setting.

              If  you specify multiple target languages for the job, translate
              ignores the formality setting for any  unsupported  target  lan-
              guage.

              For  a  list  of  target  languages  that support formality, see
              Supported languages in the Amazon Translate Developer Guide.

          Profanity -> (string)
              Enable the profanity setting if you  want  Amazon  Translate  to
              mask profane words and phrases in your translation output.

              To  mask  profane  words  and phrases, Amazon Translate replaces
              them with the grawlix string ?$#@$. This 5-character sequence is
              used  for  each profane word or phrase, regardless of the length
              or number of words.

              Amazon Translate doesn't detect profanity in  all  of  its  sup-
              ported languages. For languages that don't support profanity de-
              tection, see Unsupported languages in the Amazon  Translate  De-
              veloper Guide.

              If  you  specify  multiple target languages for the job, all the
              target languages must support profanity masking. If any  of  the
              target  languages  don't support profanity masking, the transla-
              tion job won't mask profanity for any target language.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Formality=string,Profanity=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Formality": "FORMAL"|"INFORMAL",
            "Profanity": "MASK"
          }

       --document-content (blob)
          The path to a  file  of  the  content  you  are  uploading  Example:
          fileb://data.txt

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.
