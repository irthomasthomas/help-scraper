START-TEXT-TRANSLATION-JOB()                      START-TEXT-TRANSLATION-JOB()



NAME
       start-text-translation-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  an  asynchronous  batch  translation job. Use batch translation
       jobs to translate large volumes of text across  multiple  documents  at
       once.  For  batch  translation,  you can input documents with different
       source languages (specify auto as the source language). You can specify
       one  or  more target languages. Batch translation translates each input
       document into each of the target languages. For more  information,  see
       Asynchronous batch processing .

       Batch  translation jobs can be described with the  DescribeTextTransla-
       tionJob operation, listed with the  ListTextTranslationJobs  operation,
       and stopped with the  StopTextTranslationJob operation.

OPTIONS
       --job-name (string)
          The name of the batch translation job to be performed.

       --input-data-config (structure)
          Specifies  the  format  and  location of the input documents for the
          translation job.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              The URI of the AWS S3 folder that contains the input files. Ama-
              zon Translate translates all the files in the folder and all its
              sub-folders. The folder must be in the same Region  as  the  API
              endpoint you are calling.

          ContentType -> (string)
              Describes  the  format  of  the  data  that you submit to Amazon
              Translate as input. You can specify one of the following  multi-
              purpose internet mail extension (MIME) types:

              o text/html : The input data consists of one or more HTML files.
                Amazon Translate translates only the text that resides in  the
                html element in each file.

              o text/plain  : The input data consists of one or more unformat-
                ted text files. Amazon Translate translates every character in
                this type of input.

              o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocess-
                ingml.document : The input data consists of one or  more  Word
                documents (.docx).

              o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presenta-
                tionml.presentation : The input data consists of one  or  more
                PowerPoint Presentation files (.pptx).

              o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spread-
                sheetml.sheet : The input data consists of one or  more  Excel
                Workbook files (.xlsx).

              o application/x-xliff+xml  :  The  input data consists of one or
                more XML Localization Interchange File  Format  (XLIFF)  files
                (.xlf). Amazon Translate supports only XLIFF version 1.2.

              WARNING:
                 If you structure your input data as HTML, ensure that you set
                 this parameter to text/html . By doing so, you cut  costs  by
                 limiting  the translation to the contents of the html element
                 in each  file.  Otherwise,  if  you  set  this  parameter  to
                 text/plain  ,  your costs will cover the translation of every
                 character.

       Shorthand Syntax:

            "S3Uri": "string",
            "ContentType": "string"
          }

       --output-data-config (structure)
          Specifies the S3 folder to which your job output will be saved.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              The URI of the S3 folder that contains a translation job's  out-
              put  file. The folder must be in the same Region as the API end-
              point that you are calling.

          EncryptionKey -> (structure)
              The encryption key used to encrypt this object.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the encryption key being
                 used to encrypt this object.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Uri=string,EncryptionKey={Type=string,Id=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Uri": "string",
            "EncryptionKey": {
              "Type": "KMS",
              "Id": "string"
            }
          }

       --data-access-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity Access and Manage-
          ment (IAM) role that grants Amazon Translate read access to your in-
          put data. For more information, see Identity and access management .

       --source-language-code (string)
          The language code of the input language. Specify the language if all
          input  documents share the same language. If you don't know the lan-
          guage of the source files, or your input documents contains  differ-
          ent  source  languages,  select auto . Amazon Translate auto detects
          the source language for each input document. For a list of supported
          language codes, see Supported languages .

       --target-language-codes (list)
          The target languages of the translation job. Enter up to 10 language
          codes. Each input file is translated into each target language.

          Each language code is 2 or 5 characters long. For a list of language
          codes, see Supported languages .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --terminology-names (list)
          The  name of a custom terminology resource to add to the translation
          job. This resource lists  examples  source  terms  and  the  desired
          translation for each term.

          This parameter accepts only one custom terminology resource.

          If you specify multiple target languages for the job, translate uses
          the designated terminology for each requested target  language  that
          has an entry for the source term in the terminology file.

          For a list of available custom terminology resources, use the  List-
          Terminologies operation.

          For more information, see Custom terminology .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --parallel-data-names (list)
          The name of a parallel data resource to add to the translation  job.
          This  resource  consists of examples that show how you want segments
          of text to be translated. If you specify multiple  target  languages
          for  the  job,  the parallel data file must include translations for
          all the target languages.

          When you add parallel data to a translation job, you create  an  Ac-
          tive Custom Translation job.

          This parameter accepts only one parallel data resource.

          NOTE:
              Active  Custom Translation jobs are priced at a higher rate than
              other jobs that don't use parallel data. For  more  information,
              see Amazon Translate pricing .

          For a list of available parallel data resources, use the  ListParal-
          lelData operation.

          For more information, see Customizing your translations with  paral-
          lel data .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --client-token (string)
          A unique identifier for the request. This token is generated for you
          when using the Amazon Translate SDK.

       --settings (structure)
          Settings to configure your translation output. You can configure the
          following options:

          o Brevity: not supported.

          o Formality: sets the formality level of the output text.

          o Profanity:  masks  profane  words  and phrases in your translation
            output.

          Formality -> (string)
              You can specify the desired level of formality for  translations
              to  supported  target  languages. The formality setting controls
              the level of formal language usage (also known as register )  in
              the  translation  output.  You  can set the value to informal or
              formal. If you don't specify a value for formality,  or  if  the
              target  language doesn't support formality, the translation will
              ignore the formality setting.

              If you specify multiple target languages for the job,  translate
              ignores  the  formality  setting for any unsupported target lan-
              guage.

              For a list of  target  languages  that  support  formality,  see
              Supported languages in the Amazon Translate Developer Guide.

          Profanity -> (string)
              You can enable the profanity setting if you want to mask profane
              words and phrases in your translation output.

              To mask profane words and  phrases,  Amazon  Translate  replaces
              them with the grawlix string ?$#@$. This 5-character sequence is
              used for each profane word or phrase, regardless of  the  length
              or number of words.

              Amazon  Translate  doesn't  detect  profanity in all of its sup-
              ported languages. For languages that don't support profanity de-
              tection,  see  Unsupported languages in the Amazon Translate De-
              veloper Guide.

              If you specify multiple target languages for the  job,  all  the
              target  languages  must support profanity masking. If any of the
              target languages don't support profanity masking,  the  transla-
              tion job won't mask profanity for any target language.

          Brevity -> (string)
              When you turn on brevity, Amazon Translate reduces the length of
              the translation output for most translations (when compared with
              the  same  translation  with  brevity  turned  off). By default,
              brevity is turned off.

              If you turn on brevity for a translation request with an  unsup-
              ported  language pair, the translation proceeds with the brevity
              setting turned off.

              For the language pairs that brevity supports, see Using  brevity
              in the Amazon Translate Developer Guide.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Formality=string,Profanity=string,Brevity=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Formality": "FORMAL"|"INFORMAL",
            "Profanity": "MASK",
            "Brevity": "ON"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)
