OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The  identifier  that  Amazon  Translate  generated for the job. The
          StartTextTranslationJob operation returns this identifier in its re-
          sponse.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The input configuration properties that were specified when  the
              job was requested.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The  URI  of the AWS S3 folder that contains the input files.
                 Amazon Translate translates all the files in the folder.  The
                 folder must be in the same Region as the API endpoint you are
                 calling.

                 NOTE:
                     The URI can also point to a single input document, or  it
                     can  provide  the  prefix for a collection of input docu-
                     ments. For example.  if  you  use  the  URI  S3://bucket-
                     Name/prefix  and  the  prefix  is  a  single file, Amazon
                     Translate uses that files as input. If more than one file
                     begins with the prefix, Amazon Translate uses all of them
                     as input.

              ContentType -> (string)
                 Describes the format of the data that you  submit  to  Amazon
                 Translate as input. You can specify one of the following mul-
                 tipurpose internet mail extension (MIME) types:

                 o text/html : The input data consists of  one  or  more  HTML
                   files.  Amazon  Translate translates only the text that re-
                   sides in the html element in each file.

                 o text/plain : The input data consists of one or more  unfor-
                   matted  text files. Amazon Translate translates every char-
                   acter in this type of input.

                 o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocess-
                   ingml.document  :  The  input  data consists of one or more
                   Word documents (.docx).

                 o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presenta-
                   tionml.presentation  :  The  input  data consists of one or
                   more PowerPoint Presentation files (.pptx).

                 o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spread-
                   sheetml.sheet  : The input data consists of one or more Ex-
                   cel Workbook files (.xlsx).

                 o application/x-xliff+xml : The input data consists of one or
                   more XML Localization Interchange File Format (XLIFF) files
                   (.xlf). Amazon Translate supports only XLIFF version 1.2.

                 WARNING:
                     If you structure your input data as HTML, ensure that you
                     set  this  parameter  to text/html . By doing so, you cut
                     costs by limiting the translation to the contents of  the
                     html element in each file. Otherwise, if you set this pa-
                     rameter to text/plain , your costs will cover the  trans-
                     lation of every character.

          OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The output configuration properties that were specified when the
              job was requested.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The URI of the S3 folder that contains  a  translation  job's
                 output file. The folder must be in the same Region as the API
                 endpoint that you are calling.

              EncryptionKey -> (structure)
                 The encryption key used to encrypt this object.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of encryption key used by  Amazon  Translate  to
                     encrypt this object.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the encryption key be-
                     ing used to encrypt this object.

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an  AWS  Identity  Access  and
              Management  (IAM) role that granted Amazon Translate read access
              to the job's input data.

          Settings -> (structure)
              Settings that configure the translation output.

              Formality -> (string)
                 You can optionally specify the desired level of formality for
                 real-time  translations  to  supported  target languages. The
                 formality setting controls the level of formal language usage
                 (also  known as register ) in the translation output. You can
                 set the value to informal or formal. If you don't  specify  a
                 value  for  formality, or if the target language doesn't sup-
                 port formality, the translation  will  ignore  the  formality
                 setting.

                 Note that asynchronous translation jobs don't support formal-
                 ity. If you provide a value  for  formality,  the  StartText-
                 TranslationJob  API throws an exception (InvalidRequestExcep-
                 tion).

                 For target languages that support  formality,  see  Supported
                 Languages  and  Language Codes in the Amazon Translate Devel-
                 oper Guide .

              Profanity -> (string)
                 Enable the profanity setting if you want Amazon Translate  to
                 mask profane words and phrases in your translation output.

                 To  mask profane words and phrases, Amazon Translate replaces
                 them with the grawlix string ?$#@$. This 5-character sequence
                 is  used  for  each profane word or phrase, regardless of the
                 length or number of words.

                 Amazon Translate doesn't detect profanity in all of its  sup-
                 ported languages. For languages that support profanity detec-
                 tion, see Supported Languages and Language Codes in the  Ama-
                 zon Translate Developer Guide .
