CREATE-SHARE()                                                  CREATE-SHARE()



NAME
       create-share -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  cross-account  shared resource. The resource owner makes an
       offer to share the resource with the principal subscriber (an AWS  user
       with a different account than the resource owner).

       The following resources support cross-account sharing:

       o Healthomics variant stores

       o Healthomics annotation stores

       o Private workflows

       See also: AWS API Documentation

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The ARN of the resource to be shared.

       --principal-subscriber (string)
          The  principal subscriber is the account being offered shared access
          to the resource.

       --share-name (string)
          A name that the owner defines for the share.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a share of a HealthOmics analytics store

       The following create-share example shows how to create  a  share  of  a
       HealthOmics  analytics  store that can be accepted by a subscriber out-
       side the account.

          aws omics create-share \
              --resource-arn "arn:aws:omics:us-west-2:555555555555:variantStore/omics_dev_var_store" \
              --principal-subscriber "123456789012" \
              --name "my_Share-123"

       Output:

          {
              "shareId": "495c21bedc889d07d0ab69d710a6841e-dd75ab7a1a9c384fa848b5bd8e5a7e0a",
              "name": "my_Share-123",
              "status": "PENDING"
          }

       For more information, see Cross-acount sharing in the  AWS  HealthOmics
       User Guide.

OUTPUT
       shareId -> (string)
          The ID that HealthOmics generates for the share.

       status -> (string)
          The status of the share.

       shareName -> (string)
          The name of the share.
