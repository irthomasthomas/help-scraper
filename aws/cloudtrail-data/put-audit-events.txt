NAME
       put-audit-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Ingests your application events into CloudTrail Lake. A required param-
       eter, auditEvents , accepts the JSON records (also called payload )  of
       events  that  you  want  CloudTrail to ingest. You can add up to 100 of
       these events (or up to 1 MB) per PutAuditEvents request.

OPTIONS
       --audit-events (list)
          The JSON payload of events that you want to  ingest.  You  can  also
          point to the JSON event payload in a file.

          (structure)
              An  event  from a source outside of Amazon Web Services that you
              want CloudTrail to log.

              eventData -> (string)
                 The content of an audit event that comes from the event, such
                 as userIdentity , userAgent , and eventSource .

              eventDataChecksum -> (string)
                 A checksum is a base64-SHA256 algorithm that helps you verify
                 that CloudTrail receives the  event  that  matches  with  the
                 checksum.  Calculate  the  checksum by running a command like
                 the following:
                     printf %s *$eventdata* | openssl dgst -binary  -sha256  |
                     base64

              id -> (string)
                 The original event ID from the source event.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          eventData=string,eventDataChecksum=string,id=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "eventData": "string",
              "eventDataChecksum": "string",
              "id": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --channel-arn (string)
          The ARN or ID (the ARN suffix) of a channel.

       --external-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  that is conditionally required when the chan-
          nel's resource policy includes an external ID. This value can be any
          string, such as a passphrase or account number.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
