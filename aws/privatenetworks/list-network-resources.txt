LIST-NETWORK-RESOURCES()                              LIST-NETWORK-RESOURCES()



NAME
       list-network-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  network  resources. Add filters to your request to return a more
       specific list of results. Use filters to match the Amazon Resource Name
       (ARN) of an order or the status of network resources.

       If you specify multiple filters, filters are joined with an OR, and the
       request returns results that match all of the specified filters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-network-resources is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: networkResources

OPTIONS
       --filters (map)
          The filters.

          o ORDER - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the order.

          o STATUS  -  The  status (AVAILABLE | DELETED | DELETING | PENDING |
            PENDING_RETURN | PROVISIONING | SHIPPED ).

          Filter values are case sensitive. If you specify multiple values for
          a filter, the values are joined with an OR , and the request returns
          all results that match any of the specified values.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

            KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

          Where valid key names are:
            ORDER
            STATUS

       JSON Syntax:

          {"ORDER"|"STATUS": ["string", ...]
            ...}

       --network-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the network.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

              commitmentInformation -> (structure)
                 Information  about  the commitment period for the radio unit.
                 Shows the duration, the  date  and  time  that  the  contract
                 started  and  ends,  and the renewal status of the commitment
                 period.

                 commitmentConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The duration and renewal status of the commitment  period
                     for the radio unit.

                     automaticRenewal -> (boolean)
                        Determines  whether  the commitment period for a radio
                        unit is set to automatically renew for an additional 1
                        year after your current commitment period expires.

                        Set  to  True  , if you want your commitment period to
                        automatically renew. Set to False if you do  not  want
                        your commitment to automatically renew.

                        You can do the following:

                        o Set  a  1-year commitment to automatically renew for
                          an additional 1 year. The hourly rate for the  addi-
                          tional year will continue to be the same as your ex-
                          isting 1-year rate.

                        o Set a 3-year commitment to automatically  renew  for

                        o Turn off a previously-enabled automatic renewal on a
                          1-year or 3-year commitment.

                        You cannot use  the  automatic-renewal  option  for  a
                        60-day commitment.

                     commitmentLength -> (string)

                 expiresOn -> (timestamp)
                     The date and time that the commitment period ends. If you
                     do not cancel or renew the commitment before the  expira-
                     tion  date,  you  will be billed at the 60-day-commitment
                     rate.
