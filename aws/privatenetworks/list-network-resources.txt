LIST-NETWORK-RESOURCES()                              LIST-NETWORK-RESOURCES()



NAME
       list-network-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  network  resources. Add filters to your request to return a more
       specific list of results. Use filters to match the Amazon Resource Name
       (ARN) of an order or the status of network resources.

       If you specify multiple filters, filters are joined with an OR, and the
       request returns results that match all of the specified filters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-network-resources is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: networkResources

SYNOPSIS
            list-network-resources
          [--filters <value>]
          --network-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (map)
          The filters.

          o ORDER - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the order.

          o STATUS  -  The  status (AVAILABLE | DELETED | DELETING | PENDING |
            PENDING_RETURN | PROVISIONING | SHIPPED ).

          Filter values are case sensitive. If you specify multiple values for
          a filter, the values are joined with an OR , and the request returns
          all results that match any of the specified values.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

            KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

          Where valid key names are:
            ORDER
            STATUS

       JSON Syntax:

          {"ORDER"|"STATUS": ["string", ...]
            ...}

       --network-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the network.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
