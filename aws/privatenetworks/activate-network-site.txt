OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. For more information, see How to  ensure
          idempotency .

       --commitment-configuration (structure)
          Determines  the duration and renewal status of the commitment period
          for all pending radio units.

          If  you  include  commitmentConfiguration  in  the  ActivateNetwork-
          SiteRequest action, you must specify the following:

          o The commitment period for the radio unit. You can choose a 60-day,
            1-year, or 3-year period.

          o Whether you want your commitment period to automatically renew for
            one more year after your current commitment period expires.

          For pricing, see Amazon Web Services Private 5G Pricing .

          If  you  do  not include commitmentConfiguration in the ActivateNet-
          workSiteRequest action, the commitment period is set to 60-days.

          automaticRenewal -> (boolean)
              Determines whether the commitment period for a radio unit is set
              to  automatically renew for an additional 1 year after your cur-
              rent commitment period expires.

              Set to True , if you want your commitment  period  to  automati-
              cally  renew. Set to False if you do not want your commitment to
              automatically renew.

              You can do the following:

              o Set a 1-year commitment to automatically renew  for  an  addi-
                tional  1  year.  The hourly rate for the additional year will
                continue to be the same as your existing 1-year rate.

              o Set a 3-year commitment to automatically renew  for  an  addi-
                tional  1  year.  The hourly rate for the additional year will
                continue to be the same as your existing 3-year rate.

              o Turn off a previously-enabled automatic renewal on a 1-year or
                3-year commitment.

              You cannot use the automatic-renewal option for a 60-day commit-
              ment.

          commitmentLength -> (string)
              The duration of the commitment period for the  radio  unit.  You
              can choose a 60-day, 1-year, or 3-year period.
