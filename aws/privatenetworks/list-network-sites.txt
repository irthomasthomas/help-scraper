LIST-NETWORK-SITES()                                      LIST-NETWORK-SITES()



NAME
       list-network-sites -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  network sites. Add filters to your request to return a more spe-
       cific list of results. Use filters to match the status of  the  network
       site.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-network-sites  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: networkSites

SYNOPSIS
            list-network-sites
          [--filters <value>]
          --network-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (map)
          The filters. Add filters to your request to return a  more  specific
          list  of  results.  Use  filters  to match the status of the network
          sites.

          o STATUS - The status (AVAILABLE | CREATED | DELETED |  DEPROVISION-
            ING | PROVISIONING ).

          Filter values are case sensitive. If you specify multiple values for
          a filter, the values are joined with an OR , and the request returns
          all results that match any of the specified values.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

            KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

          Where valid key names are:
            STATUS

       JSON Syntax:

          {"STATUS": ["string", ...]
            ...}

       --network-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the network.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
