NAME
       configure-access-point -

DESCRIPTION
       Configures the specified network resource.

       Use this action to specify the geographic position of the hardware. You
       must provide Certified Professional Installer (CPI) credentials in  the
       request  so  that  we can obtain spectrum grants. For more information,
       see Radio units in the Amazon Web Services Private 5G User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS

          [--cpi-secret-key <value>]
          [--cpi-user-id <value>]
          [--cpi-user-password <value>]

OPTIONS
       --access-point-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the network resource.

       --cpi-secret-key (string)
          A Base64 encoded string of the CPI certificate associated  with  the
          CPI user who is certifying the coordinates of the network resource.

       --cpi-user-id (string)
          The CPI user ID of the CPI user who is certifying the coordinates of
          the network resource.

       --cpi-user-password (string)
          The CPI password associated with the CPI certificate in cpiSecretKey
          .

       --cpi-username (string)
          The  CPI user name of the CPI user who is certifying the coordinates
          of the radio unit.

       --position (structure)
          The position of the network resource.

          elevation -> (double)
              The elevation of the equipment at this position.

          elevationReference -> (string)
              The reference point from which elevation is reported.

          elevationUnit -> (string)
              The units used to measure the elevation of the position.

          latitude -> (double)
              The latitude of the position.

          longitude -> (double)
              The longitude of the position.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          elevation=double,elevationReference=string,elevationUnit=string,latitude=double,longitude=double

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "elevation": double,
            "elevationReference": "AGL"|"AMSL",
            "elevationUnit": "FEET",
            "latitude": double,
            "longitude": double
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
