          CPI user who is certifying the coordinates of the network resource.

       --cpi-user-id (string)
          The CPI user ID of the CPI user who is certifying the coordinates of
          the network resource.

       --cpi-user-password (string)

          of the radio unit.

       --position (structure)
          The position of the network resource.

          elevation -> (double)
              The elevation of the equipment at this position.

          elevationReference -> (string)
              The reference point from which elevation is reported.

          elevationUnit -> (string)
              The units used to measure the elevation of the position.

          latitude -> (double)
              The latitude of the position.

          longitude -> (double)
              The longitude of the position.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          elevation=double,elevationReference=string,elevationUnit=string,latitude=double,longitude=double

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "elevation": double,
            "elevationReference": "AGL"|"AMSL",
            "elevationUnit": "FEET",
            "latitude": double,
            "longitude": double
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
