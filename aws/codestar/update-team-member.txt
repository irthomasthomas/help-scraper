OPTIONS
       --project-id (string)
          The ID of the project.

       --user-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the user for whom you want to
          change team membership attributes.

       --project-role (string)
          The role assigned to the user in the  project.  Project  roles  have
          different  levels  of access. For more information, see Working with
          Teams in the AWS CodeStar User Guide .

       --remote-access-allowed | --no-remote-access-allowed (boolean)
          Whether a team member is allowed  to  remotely  access  project  re-
          sources using the SSH public key associated with the user's profile.
          Even if this is set to True, the user must associate  a  public  key
          with their profile before the user can access resources.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To modify a team member

       The  following  update-team-member  example  makes the specified user a
       contributor on a project and grants them remote access to  project  re-
       sources.

          aws codestar update-team-member \
              --project-id my-project \
              --user-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/intern \
              --project-role Contributor -\
              --remote-access-allowed

       Output:

          {
              "userArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/intern",
              "projectRole": "Contributor",
              "remoteAccessAllowed": true
          }

OUTPUT
       userArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the user whose team membership at-
          tributes were updated.

       projectRole -> (string)
          The project role granted to the user.

       remoteAccessAllowed -> (boolean)
          Whether a team member is allowed  to  remotely  access  project  re-
          sources using the SSH public key associated with the user's profile.
