       create-user-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  profile  for a user that includes user preferences, such as
       the display name and email address assocciated with the  user,  in  AWS
       CodeStar.  The user profile is not project-specific. Information in the

       other users in AWS CodeStar.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-user-profile
          --user-arn <value>
          --display-name <value>
          --email-address <value>
          [--ssh-public-key <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the user in IAM.

       --display-name (string)
          The name that will be displayed as the friendly name for the user in
          AWS CodeStar.

       --email-address (string)
          The email address that will be displayed as part of the user's  pro-
          file in AWS CodeStar.

       --ssh-public-key (string)
          The  SSH  public  key associated with the user in AWS CodeStar. If a
          project owner allows the user remote access  to  project  resources,
          this  public  key will be used along with the user's private key for
          SSH access.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a user profile

       The following create-user-profile example creates a  user  profile  for
       the IAM user with the specified ARN.

          aws codestar create-user-profile \
              --user-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/intern \
              --display-name Intern \
              --email-address intern@example.com

       Output:

          {
              "userArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/intern",
              "displayName": "Intern",
              "emailAddress": "intern@example.com",
              "sshPublicKey": "",
              "createdTimestamp": 1572552308.607,
              "lastModifiedTimestamp": 1572552308.607
          }
