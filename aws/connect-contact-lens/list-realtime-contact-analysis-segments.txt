OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance.

       --contact-id (string)
          The identifier of the contact.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return per page.

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
          previous response in the next request to retrieve the  next  set  of
          results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                 Status -> (string)
                     Whether  the summary was successfully COMPLETED or FAILED
                     to be generated.

                 FailureCode -> (string)
                     If the summary failed to be generated, one of the follow-
                     ing failure codes occurs:

                     o QUOTA_EXCEEDED  :  The  number  of concurrent analytics
                       jobs reached your service quota.

                     o INSUFFICIENT_CONVERSATION_CONTENT  :  The  conversation
                       needs  to have at least one turn from both the partici-
                       pants in order to generate the summary.

                     o FAILED_SAFETY_GUIDELINES : The generated summary cannot
                       be  provided  because  it  failed to meet system safety
                       guidelines.

                     o INVALID_ANALYSIS_CONFIGURATION : This code occurs when,
                       for  example,  you're  using a language that isn't sup-
                       ported by generative AI-powered post-contact summaries.

                     o INTERNAL_ERROR : Internal system error.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If there are additional results, this is the token for the next  set
          of  results.  If  response includes nextToken there are two possible
          scenarios:

          o There are more segments so another call is required to get them.

          o There are no more segments at this time, but more may be available
            later  (real-time  analysis  is  in progress) so the client should
            call the operation again to get new segments.

          If response does not include nextToken , the analysis  is  completed
          (successfully or failed) and there are no more segments to retrieve.
