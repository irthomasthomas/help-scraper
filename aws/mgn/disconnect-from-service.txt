DISCONNECT-FROM-SERVICE()                            DISCONNECT-FROM-SERVICE()



NAME
       disconnect-from-service -

DESCRIPTION
       Disconnects specific Source Servers from Application Migration Service.
       Data replication is stopped immediately. All AWS resources  created  by
       Application  Migration  Service  for  enabling the replication of these
       source servers will be terminated / deleted within 90 minutes. Launched
       Test  or  Cutover instances will NOT be terminated. If the agent on the
       source server has not been prevented from communicating with the Appli-
       cation  Migration  Service  service,  then it will receive a command to
       uninstall itself (within approximately 10 minutes). The following prop-
       erties  of  the  SourceServer will be changed immediately: dataReplica-
       tionInfo.dataReplicationState will be set to DISCONNECTED;  The  total-
       StorageBytes  property  for each of dataReplicationInfo.replicatedDisks
       will be set to zero; dataReplicationInfo.lagDuration  and  dataReplica-
       tionInfo.lagDuration will be nullified.

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          Request to disconnect Source Server from service by Account ID.

       --source-server-id (string)
          Request to disconnect Source Server from service by Server ID.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
