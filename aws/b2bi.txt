NAME
       b2bi -

DESCRIPTION
       This is the Amazon Web Services B2B Data Interchange API Reference . It
       provides descriptions, API request parameters, and the XML response for
       each of the B2BI API actions.

       B2BI  enables  automated  exchange of EDI (electronic data interchange)
       based business-critical transactions at cloud  scale,  with  elasticity
       and  pay-as-you-go  pricing.  Businesses  use EDI documents to exchange
       transactional data with trading partners, such  as  suppliers  and  end
       customers, using standardized formats such as X12.

       NOTE:
          Rather  than  actually  running  a command, you can use the --gener-
          ate-cli-skeleton parameter with any API call to generate and display
          a  parameter  template.  You  can then use the generated template to
          customize and use as input on a  later  command.  For  details,  see
          Generate and use a parameter skeleton file .
