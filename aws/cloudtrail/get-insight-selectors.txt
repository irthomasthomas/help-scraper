GET-INSIGHT-SELECTORS()                                GET-INSIGHT-SELECTORS()



NAME
       get-insight-selectors -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  settings for the Insights event selectors that you con-
       figured for your trail or event data store.  GetInsightSelectors  shows
       if  CloudTrail  Insights event logging is enabled on the trail or event
       data store, and if it is, which Insights types are enabled. If you  run
       GetInsightSelectors  on  a trail or event data store that does not have
       Insights events enabled, the operation throws  the  exception  Insight-
       NotEnabledException

       Specify  either  the EventDataStore parameter to get Insights event se-
       lectors for an event data store, or the TrailName parameter to the  get
       Insights  event selectors for a trail. You cannot specify these parame-
       ters together.

       For more information, see Logging CloudTrail  Insights  events  in  the
       CloudTrail User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --trail-name (string)
          Specifies the name of the trail or trail ARN. If you specify a trail
          name, the string must meet the following requirements:

          o Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.),
            underscores (_), or dashes (-)

          o Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number

          o Be between 3 and 128 characters

          o Have  no  adjacent  periods,  underscores  or  dashes.  Names like
            my-_namespace and my--namespace are not valid.

          o Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)

          If you specify a trail ARN, it must be in the format:
              arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail

          You cannot use this parameter with the EventDataStore parameter.

       --event-data-store (string)
          Specifies the ARN (or ID suffix of the ARN) of the event data  store
          for which you want to get Insights selectors.

          You cannot use this parameter with the TrailName parameter.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       TrailARN -> (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a trail for which you want to get
          Insights selectors.

       InsightSelectors -> (list)
          A JSON string that contains the Insight types you want to log  on  a
          trail  or  event  data store. ApiErrorRateInsight and ApiCallRateIn-
          sight are supported as Insights types.

          (structure)
              A JSON string that contains a list of Insights  types  that  are
              logged on a trail or event data store.

              InsightType -> (string)
                 The  type  of Insights events to log on a trail or event data
                 store. ApiCallRateInsight and ApiErrorRateInsight  are  valid
                 Insight types.

                 The ApiCallRateInsight Insights type analyzes write-only man-
                 agement API calls that are aggregated per  minute  against  a
                 baseline API call volume.

                 The ApiErrorRateInsight Insights type analyzes management API
                 calls that result in error codes. The error is shown  if  the
                 API call is unsuccessful.

       EventDataStoreArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the source event data store that enabled Insights events.

       InsightsDestination -> (string)
          The  ARN  of  the  destination  event  data store that logs Insights
          events.
