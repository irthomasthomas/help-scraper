OPTIONS
       --event-data-store (string)
          The ARN (or ID suffix of the ARN) of  the  event  data  store  about
          which you want information.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       EventDataStoreArn -> (string)
          The event data store Amazon Resource Number (ARN).

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the event data store.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of an event data store.

       AdvancedEventSelectors -> (list)
          The  advanced  event  selectors  used  to select events for the data
          store.

          (structure)
              Advanced event selectors let you create  fine-grained  selectors
              for  CloudTrail  management,  data, and network activity events.
              They help you control costs by logging only  those  events  that
              are important to you. For more information about configuring ad-
              vanced event selectors, see the Logging data  events  ,  Logging
              network  activity  events , and Logging management events topics
              in the CloudTrail User Guide .

              You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event  selec-
              tors to a trail.

                        For event data stores for CloudTrail Insights  events,
                        Config configuration items, Audit Manager evidence, or
                        events outside of Amazon Web Services, the  only  sup-

                          used for management events  and  data  events.  This
                          field  can  be set to Equals with a value of true or
                          false . If you do not  add  this  field,  CloudTrail

                          write events.

                          ment events, data  events  (for  event  data  stores
                          only),  and  network activity events. For management
                          events for trails, this is an  optional  field  that
                          can  be  set  to NotEquals  kms.amazonaws.com to ex-
                          clude KMS  management  events,  or  NotEquals   rds-
                          data.amazonaws.com to exclude RDS management events.
                          For  management  and  data  events  for  event  data
                          stores,  you  can  use  it to include or exclude any
                          event source and can use any operator.  For  network
                          activity  events, this is a required field that only
                          uses the Equals operator.  Set  this  field  to  the
                          event  source  for which you want to log network ac-
                          tivity events. If you want to log  network  activity
                          events for multiple event sources, you must create a
                          separate field selector for each event  source.  The
                          following  are  valid  values  for  network activity
                          events:

                          as the matching value. For information about filter-
