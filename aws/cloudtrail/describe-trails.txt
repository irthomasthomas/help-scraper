OPTIONS
       --trail-name-list (list)
          Specifies a list of trail names, trail ARNs, or both, of the  trails
          to describe. The format of a trail ARN is:
              arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail

          If an empty list is specified, information for the trail in the cur-
          rent Region is returned.

          o If an empty list is specified and  IncludeShadowTrails  is  false,
            then information for all trails in the current Region is returned.

          o If  an  empty list is specified and IncludeShadowTrails is null or
            true, then information for all trails in the  current  Region  and
            any associated shadow trails in other Regions is returned.

          NOTE:
              If  one  or  more  trail names are specified, information is re-
              turned only if the names match the  names  of  trails  belonging
              only to the current Region and current account. To return infor-
              mation about a trail in another Region,  you  must  specify  its
              trail ARN.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --include-shadow-trails | --no-include-shadow-trails (boolean)
          Specifies whether to include shadow trails in the response. A shadow
          trail is the replication in a Region of a trail that was created  in
          a  different  Region,  or  in the case of an organization trail, the
          replication of an organization trail in member accounts. If  you  do
          not  include  shadow trails, organization trails in a member account
          and Region replication trails will not be returned. The  default  is
          true.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       trailList -> (list)
          The list of trail objects. Trail objects with string values are only
          returned if values for the objects exist in a trail's configuration.
          For example, SNSTopicName and SNSTopicARN are only returned  in  re-
          sults if a trail is configured to send SNS notifications. Similarly,
          KMSKeyId only appears in results if a  trail's  log  files  are  en-
          crypted with KMS customer managed keys.
