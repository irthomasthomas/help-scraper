LIST-INSIGHTS-METRIC-DATA()                        LIST-INSIGHTS-METRIC-DATA()



NAME
       list-insights-metric-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  Insights  metrics  data for trails that have enabled Insights.
       The request must include the EventSource , EventName , and  InsightType
       parameters.

       If  the  InsightType  is  set to ApiErrorRateInsight , the request must
       also include the ErrorCode parameter.

       The following are the available time periods for ListInsightsMetricData
       . Each cutoff is inclusive.

       o Data  points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for
         15 days.

       o Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for
         63 days.

       o Data  points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for
         90 days.

       Access to the ListInsightsMetricData API operation  is  linked  to  the
       cloudtrail:LookupEvents  action.  To  use this operation, you must have
       permissions to perform the cloudtrail:LookupEvents action.

OPTIONS
       --event-source (string)
          The Amazon Web Services service to which the request was made,  such
          as iam.amazonaws.com or s3.amazonaws.com .

       --event-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  event,  typically the Amazon Web Services API on
          which unusual levels of activity were recorded.

       --insight-type (string)
          The type of CloudTrail Insights  event,  which  is  either  ApiCall-
          RateInsight or ApiErrorRateInsight . The ApiCallRateInsight Insights
          type analyzes write-only management API calls  that  are  aggregated
          per  minute  against a baseline API call volume. The ApiErrorRateIn-
          sight Insights type analyzes management API calls that result in er-
          ror codes.

          Possible values:

          o ApiCallRateInsight

          o ApiErrorRateInsight

       --error-code (string)
          Conditionally required if the InsightType parameter is set to ApiEr-
          rorRateInsight .

          If returning metrics for the ApiErrorRateInsight Insights type, this
          is the error to retrieve data for. For example, AccessDenied .

       --start-time (timestamp)
          Specifies,  in  UTC,  the start time for time-series data. The value
          specified is inclusive; results include data points with the  speci-
          fied time stamp.

          The default is 90 days before the time of request.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          Specifies,  in  UTC,  the  end  time for time-series data. The value
          specified is exclusive; results include data points up to the speci-
          fied time stamp.

          The default is the time of request.

       --period (integer)
          Granularity  of  data to retrieve, in seconds. Valid values are 60 ,
          300 , and 3600 . If you specify any other value, you will get an er-
          ror. The default is 3600 seconds.

       --data-type (string)
          Type  of  data  points  to  return. Valid values are NonZeroData and
          FillWithZeros . The default is NonZeroData .

          Possible values:

          o FillWithZeros

          o NonZeroData

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of data points to return. Valid values are  inte-
          gers from 1 to 21600. The default value is 21600.

       --next-token (string)
          Returned  if  all datapoints can't be returned in a single call. For
          example, due to reaching MaxResults .

          Add this parameter to the request  to  continue  retrieving  results
          starting from the last evaluated point.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       EventSource -> (string)
          The  Amazon Web Services service to which the request was made, such
          as iam.amazonaws.com or s3.amazonaws.com .

       EventName -> (string)
          The name of the event, typically the  Amazon  Web  Services  API  on
          which unusual levels of activity were recorded.

       InsightType -> (string)
          The  type  of  CloudTrail  Insights  event, which is either ApiCall-
          RateInsight or ApiErrorRateInsight . The ApiCallRateInsight Insights
          type  analyzes  write-only  management API calls that are aggregated
          per minute against a baseline API call volume.  The  ApiErrorRateIn-
          sight Insights type analyzes management API calls that result in er-
          ror codes.

       ErrorCode -> (string)
          Only returned if InsightType parameter was  set  to  ApiErrorRateIn-
          sight .

          If returning metrics for the ApiErrorRateInsight Insights type, this
          is the error to retrieve data for. For example, AccessDenied .

       Timestamps -> (list)
          List of timestamps at intervals corresponding to the specified  time
          period.

          (timestamp)

       Values -> (list)
          List  of values representing the API call rate or error rate at each
          timestamp. The number of values is equal  to  the  number  of  time-
          stamps.

          (double)

       NextToken -> (string)
          Only  returned if the full results could not be returned in a single
          query. You can set the NextToken parameter in the  next  request  to
          this value to continue retrieval.
