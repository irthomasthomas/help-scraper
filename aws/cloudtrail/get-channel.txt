SYNOPSIS
            get-channel
          --channel <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel (string)
          The ARN or UUID of a channel.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ChannelArn -> (string)
          The ARN of an channel returned by a GetChannel request.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the CloudTrail channel. For service-linked channels, the
          name  is  aws-service-channel/service-name/custom-suffix  where ser-
          vice-name represents the name of the  Amazon  Web  Services  service
          that  created  the  channel  and custom-suffix represents the suffix
          generated by the Amazon Web Services service.

       Source -> (string)
          The source for the CloudTrail channel.

       SourceConfig -> (structure)
          Provides information about the advanced event  selectors  configured
          for the channel, and whether the channel applies to all regions or a
          single region.

          ApplyToAllRegions -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the channel applies to a single region  or  to
              all regions.

          AdvancedEventSelectors -> (list)
              The  advanced  event selectors that are configured for the chan-
              nel.

              (structure)
                 Advanced event selectors let you create  fine-grained  selec-
                 tors  for  the  following  CloudTrail event record elds. They
                 help you control costs by logging only those events that  are
                 important  to  you. For more information about advanced event
                 selectors, see Logging data events for trails in  the  Cloud-
                 Trail User Guide .

                 You  cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event se-
                 lectors to a trail.

                 Name -> (string)
                     An optional, descriptive name for an advanced  event  se-
                     lector,  such  as  "Log data events for only two S3 buck-
                     ets".

                 FieldSelectors -> (list)
                     Contains all selector statements in an advanced event se-
                     lector.

                     (structure)
                        A  single  selector statement in an advanced event se-
                        lector.

                        Field -> (string)
                            A field in a CloudTrail event record on  which  to
                            filter  events to be logged. For event data stores
                            for Config configuration items, Audit Manager evi-
                            dence,  or  non-Amazon  Web  Services  events, the
                            field is used only for selecting events as filter-
                            ing is not supported.

                            For CloudTrail event records, supported fields in-
                            clude readOnly , eventCategory , eventSource  (for
                            management  events),  eventName , resources.type ,
                            and resources.ARN .

                            Services  events,  the  only  supported  field  is
                            eventCategory .

                              value of true or false . If you do not add  this
                              field,  CloudTrail  logs  both  read  and  write
                              events. A value of true logs only read events. A
                              value of false logs only write events.

                            (string)

       Destinations -> (list)
          The  destinations for the channel. For channels created for integra-
          tions, the destinations are the event data stores  that  log  events
          arriving  through the channel. For service-linked channels, the des-
          tination is the Amazon Web Services service that  created  the  ser-
          vice-linked channel to receive events.

          (structure)
              Contains information about the destination receiving events.

              Type -> (string)
                 The  type  of destination for events arriving from a channel.
                 For channels used for  a  CloudTrail  Lake  integration,  the
                 value  is  EventDataStore  . For service-linked channels, the
                 value is AWS_SERVICE .

              Location -> (string)
                 For channels used for a CloudTrail Lake integration, the  lo-
                 cation is the ARN of an event data store that receives events
                 from a channel. For service-linked channels, the location  is
                 the name of the Amazon Web Services service.

       IngestionStatus -> (structure)
          A  table  showing  information  about the most recent successful and
          failed attempts to ingest events.

          LatestIngestionSuccessTime -> (timestamp)
              The time stamp of the most recent successful ingestion of events
              for the channel.

          LatestIngestionSuccessEventID -> (string)
              The event ID of the most recent successful ingestion of events.

          LatestIngestionErrorCode -> (string)
              The error code for the most recent failure to ingest events.

          LatestIngestionAttemptTime -> (timestamp)
              The  time  stamp  of the most recent attempt to ingest events on
              the channel.

          LatestIngestionAttemptEventID -> (string)
              The event ID of the most recent attempt to ingest events.
