SYNOPSIS
            get-channel
          --channel <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel (string)
          The ARN or UUID of a channel.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ChannelArn -> (string)
          The ARN of an channel returned by a GetChannel request.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the CloudTrail channel. For service-linked channels, the
          name is  aws-service-channel/service-name/custom-suffix  where  ser-
          vice-name  represents  the  name  of the Amazon Web Services service
          that created the channel and  custom-suffix  represents  the  suffix
          generated by the Amazon Web Services service.

       Source -> (string)
          The source for the CloudTrail channel.

       SourceConfig -> (structure)
          Provides  information  about the advanced event selectors configured
          for the channel, and whether the channel applies to all Regions or a
          single Region.

          ApplyToAllRegions -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  the channel applies to a single Region or to
              all Regions.

          AdvancedEventSelectors -> (list)
              The advanced event selectors that are configured for  the  chan-
              nel.

              (structure)
                 Advanced  event  selectors let you create fine-grained selec-
                 tors for CloudTrail management, data,  and  network  activity
                 events.  They  help  you  control costs by logging only those
                 events that are important to you. For more information  about
                 configuring  advanced  event  selectors, see the Logging data
                 events , Logging network activity events , and  Logging  man-
                 agement events topics in the CloudTrail User Guide .

                 You  cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event se-
                 lectors to a trail.

                              value  of true logs only read events. A value of
                              false logs only write events.

       Destinations -> (list)
          The destinations for the channel. For channels created for  integra-

          arriving through the channel. For service-linked channels, the  des-
          tination  is  the  Amazon Web Services service that created the ser-
          vice-linked channel to receive events.

          (structure)
              Contains information about the destination receiving events.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of destination for events arriving from  a  channel.
                 For  channels  used  for  a  CloudTrail Lake integration, the
                 value is EVENT_DATA_STORE . For service-linked channels,  the

              Location -> (string)
                 For  channels used for a CloudTrail Lake integration, the lo-
                 cation is the ARN of an event data store that receives events
                 from  a channel. For service-linked channels, the location is
                 the name of the Amazon Web Services service.

       IngestionStatus -> (structure)
          A table showing information about the  most  recent  successful  and
          failed attempts to ingest events.

          LatestIngestionSuccessEventID -> (string)
              The event ID of the most recent successful ingestion of events.

          LatestIngestionErrorCode -> (string)
              The error code for the most recent failure to ingest events.

          LatestIngestionAttemptTime -> (timestamp)
              The time stamp of the most recent attempt to  ingest  events  on
