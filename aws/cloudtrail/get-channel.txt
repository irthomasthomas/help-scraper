GET-CHANNEL()                                                    GET-CHANNEL()



NAME
       get-channel -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about a specific channel. Amazon Web Services ser-
       vices create service-linked channels to get  information  about  Cloud-
       Trail  events on your behalf. For more information about service-linked
       channels, see Viewing service-linked channels for CloudTrail  by  using
       the CLI .

SYNOPSIS
            get-channel
          --channel <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel (string)
          The ARN or UUID of a channel.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ChannelArn -> (string)
          The ARN of an channel returned by a GetChannel request.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the CloudTrail channel. For service-linked channels, the
          value  is  aws-service-channel/service-name/custom-suffix where ser-
          vice-name represents the name of the  Amazon  Web  Services  service
          that  created  the  channel  and custom-suffix represents the suffix
          generated by the Amazon Web Services service.

       Source -> (string)
          The event source for the CloudTrail channel.

       SourceConfig -> (structure)
          Provides information about the advanced event  selectors  configured
          for the channel, and whether the channel applies to all regions or a
          single region.

          ApplyToAllRegions -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the channel applies to a single region  or  to
              all regions.

          AdvancedEventSelectors -> (list)
              The  advanced  event selectors that are configured for the chan-
              nel.

              (structure)
                 Advanced event selectors let you create  fine-grained  selec-
                 tors  for  the  following  CloudTrail event record elds. They
                 help you control costs by logging only those events that  are
                 important  to  you. For more information about advanced event
                 selectors, see Logging data events for trails in  the  Cloud-
                 Trail User Guide .

                 You  cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event se-
                 lectors to a trail.

                 Name -> (string)
                     An optional, descriptive name for an advanced  event  se-
                     lector,  such  as  "Log data events for only two S3 buck-
                     ets".

                 FieldSelectors -> (list)
                     Contains all selector statements in an advanced event se-
                     lector.

                     (structure)
                        A  single  selector statement in an advanced event se-
                        lector.

                        Field -> (string)
                            A field in an event  record  on  which  to  filter
                            events  to  be  logged.  Supported  fields include
                            readOnly , eventCategory , eventSource  (for  man-
                            agement  events), eventName , resources.type , and
                            resources.ARN .

                              value  of true or false . If you do not add this
                              field,  CloudTrail  logs  both  read  and  write
                              events. A value of true logs only read events. A
                              value of false logs only write events.

                              resources.ARN ** - You can use any operator with
                              resources.ARN  ,  but if you use Equals or NotE-
                              quals , the value must exactly match the ARN  of
                              a  valid  resource of the type you've specied in
                              the template as the value of resources.type. For
                              example,  if  resources.type equals AWS::S3::Ob-
                              ject , the ARN must be in one of  the  following
                              formats.  To log all data events for all objects
                              in a specific S3 bucket, use the StartsWith  op-
                              erator,  and  include only the bucket ARN as the
                              matching value. The  trailing  slash  is  inten-
                              tional;  do not exclude it. Replace the text be-
                              tween less than and greater  than  symbols  (<>)
                              with resource-specific information.
