SYNOPSIS
            get-channel
          --channel <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]

          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel (string)
          The ARN or UUID of a channel.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ChannelArn -> (string)
          The ARN of an channel returned by a GetChannel request.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the CloudTrail channel. For service-linked channels, the
          name  is  aws-service-channel/service-name/custom-suffix  where ser-
          vice-name represents the name of the  Amazon  Web  Services  service
          that  created  the  channel  and custom-suffix represents the suffix
          generated by the Amazon Web Services service.

       Source -> (string)
          The source for the CloudTrail channel.

       SourceConfig -> (structure)
          Provides information about the advanced event  selectors  configured
          for the channel, and whether the channel applies to all Regions or a
          single Region.

          ApplyToAllRegions -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the channel applies to a single Region  or  to
              all Regions.

          AdvancedEventSelectors -> (list)
              The  advanced  event selectors that are configured for the chan-
              nel.

              (structure)
                 Advanced event selectors let you create  fine-grained  selec-
                 tors for CloudTrail management and data events. They help you
                 control costs by logging only those events that are important
                 to  you. For more information about advanced event selectors,
                 see Logging management events and Logging data events in  the
                 CloudTrail User Guide .

                 You  cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event se-
                 lectors to a trail.

                            only for selecting events as filtering is not sup-

                              quals  , the value must exactly match the ARN of
                              a valid resource of the type you've  specied  in
                              the template as the value of resources.type.

                            NOTE:
                                   You  can't  use  the resources.ARN field to

                                   ARNs.

                               The  resources.ARN  field can be set one of the
                               following.     If     resources.type     equals
                               AWS::S3::Object , the ARN must be in one of the

                               bucket  ARN as the matching value. The trailing
                               slash is intentional; do not  exclude  it.  Re-

                               than symbols (<>) with resource-specific infor-

       Destinations -> (list)
          The destinations for the channel. For channels created for  integra-
          tions,  the  destinations  are the event data stores that log events
          arriving through the channel. For service-linked channels, the  des-
          tination  is  the  Amazon Web Services service that created the ser-
          vice-linked channel to receive events.

          (structure)
              Contains information about the destination receiving events.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of destination for events arriving from  a  channel.
                 For  channels  used  for  a  CloudTrail Lake integration, the
                 value is EVENT_DATA_STORE . For service-linked channels,  the
                 value is AWS_SERVICE .

              Location -> (string)
                 For  channels used for a CloudTrail Lake integration, the lo-
                 cation is the ARN of an event data store that receives events
                 from  a channel. For service-linked channels, the location is
                 the name of the Amazon Web Services service.

       IngestionStatus -> (structure)
          A table showing information about the  most  recent  successful  and
          failed attempts to ingest events.

          LatestIngestionSuccessTime -> (timestamp)
              The time stamp of the most recent successful ingestion of events
              for the channel.

          LatestIngestionSuccessEventID -> (string)
              The event ID of the most recent successful ingestion of events.

          LatestIngestionErrorCode -> (string)
              The error code for the most recent failure to ingest events.

          LatestIngestionAttemptTime -> (timestamp)
              The time stamp of the most recent attempt to  ingest  events  on
              the channel.

          LatestIngestionAttemptEventID -> (string)
              The event ID of the most recent attempt to ingest events.
