OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A token you can use to get the next page of  event  data  store  re-
          sults.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of event data stores to display on a single page.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       EventDataStores -> (list)
          Contains information about event data stores in the account, in  the
          current region.

          (structure)
              A  storage  lake of event data against which you can run complex
              SQL-based queries. An event data store can include  events  that
              you  have  logged  on your account from the last 90 to 2557 days
              (about three months to up to seven years). To select events  for
              an event data store, use advanced event selectors .

              EventDataStoreArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the event data store.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the event data store.

              TerminationProtectionEnabled -> (boolean)
                 This  field  is being deprecated. Indicates whether the event
                 data store is protected from termination.

              Status -> (string)
                 This field is being deprecated. The status of an  event  data
                 store. Values are ENABLED and PENDING_DELETION .

              AdvancedEventSelectors -> (list)
                 This  field is being deprecated. The advanced event selectors
                 that were used to select events for the data store.

                 (structure)
                     Advanced event selectors let you create fine-grained  se-
                     lectors  for  the following CloudTrail event record elds.
                     They help you control costs by logging only those  events
                     that are important to you. For more information about ad-
                     vanced event  selectors,  see  Logging  data  events  for
                     trails in the CloudTrail User Guide .

                     o readOnly

                     o eventSource

                     o eventName

                     o eventCategory

                     o resources.type

                     o resources.ARN

                     You  cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event
                     selectors to a trail.

                     Name -> (string)
                        An optional, descriptive name for  an  advanced  event
                        selector,  such  as  "Log  data events for only two S3
                        buckets".

                     FieldSelectors -> (list)
                        Contains all selector statements in an advanced  event
                        selector.

                        (structure)
                            A  single  selector statement in an advanced event
                            selector.

                            Field -> (string)
                               A field in an event record on which  to  filter
                               events  to  be logged. Supported fields include
                               readOnly ,  eventCategory  ,  eventSource  (for
                               management  events), eventName , resources.type
                               , and resources.ARN .

                               o

                                 **
                                 readOnly ** - Optional. Can be set to  Equals
                                 a  value of true or false . If you do not add
                                 this field, CloudTrail  logs  both  read  and
                                 write  events. A value of true logs only read
                                 events. A value  of  false  logs  only  write
                                 events.
