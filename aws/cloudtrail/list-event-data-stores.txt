OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A token you can use to get the next page of  event  data  store  re-
          sults.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of event data stores to display on a single page.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       EventDataStores -> (list)
          Contains  information about event data stores in the account, in the
          current Region.

          (structure)
              A storage lake of event data against which you can  run  complex
              SQL-based  queries.  An event data store can include events that
              you have logged on your account. To select events for  an  event
              data store, use advanced event selectors .

              EventDataStoreArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the event data store.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the event data store.

              TerminationProtectionEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the event data store is protected from ter-
                 mination.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of an event data store.

              AdvancedEventSelectors -> (list)
                 The advanced event selectors that were used to select  events
                 for the data store.

                 (structure)
                     Advanced  event selectors let you create fine-grained se-
                     lectors for CloudTrail management, data, and network  ac-
                     tivity  events.  They  help  you control costs by logging
                     only those events that are important to you. For more in-
                     formation about configuring advanced event selectors, see
                     the Logging data events , Logging network activity events
                     ,  and Logging management events topics in the CloudTrail
                     User Guide .

                     You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced  event
                     selectors to a trail.
