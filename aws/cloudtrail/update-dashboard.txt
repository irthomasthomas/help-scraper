UPDATE-DASHBOARD()                                          UPDATE-DASHBOARD()



NAME
       update-dashboard -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the specified dashboard.

       To  set  a  refresh schedule, CloudTrail must be granted permissions to
       run the StartDashboardRefresh operation to  refresh  the  dashboard  on
       your  behalf.  To provide permissions, run the PutResourcePolicy opera-
       tion to attach a resource-based policy to the dashboard. For  more  in-
       formation,  see  Resource-based  policy  example for a dashboard in the
       CloudTrail User Guide .

       CloudTrail runs queries to populate the dashboard's  widgets  during  a
       manual  or scheduled refresh. CloudTrail must be granted permissions to
       run the StartQuery operation on your behalf.  To  provide  permissions,
       run  the  PutResourcePolicy operation to attach a resource-based policy
       to each event data store. For  more  information,  see  Example:  Allow
       CloudTrail  to  run  queries  to populate a dashboard in the CloudTrail
       User Guide .

       --widgets (list)
          An array of widgets for the dashboard. A custom dashboard can have a
          maximum of 10 widgets.

          To add new widgets, pass in an array that includes the existing wid-
          gets along with any new widgets. Run the GetDashboard  operation  to
          get the list of widgets for the dashboard.

          To  remove widgets, pass in an array that includes the existing wid-
          gets minus the widgets you want removed.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a widget on a CloudTrail  Lake  dash-
              board.

              QueryStatement -> (string)
                 The query statement for the widget. For custom dashboard wid-
                 gets, you can query across multiple event data stores as long
                 as all event data stores exist in your account.

                 NOTE:
                     When a query uses ? with eventTime , ? must be surrounded
                     by single quotes as follows: '?' .

              QueryParameters -> (list)
                 The optional query parameters. The following query parameters
