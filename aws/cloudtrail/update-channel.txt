OPTIONS
       --channel (string)
          The  ARN  or ID (the ARN suffix) of the channel that you want to up-
          date.

       --destinations (list)
          The ARNs of event data stores that you want to log  events  arriving
          through the channel.

          (structure)
              Contains information about the destination receiving events.

              Type -> (string)
                 The  type  of destination for events arriving from a channel.
                 For channels used for  a  CloudTrail  Lake  integration,  the
                 value  is  EventDataStore  . For service-linked channels, the
                 value is AWS_SERVICE .

              Location -> (string)
                 For channels used for a CloudTrail Lake integration, the  lo-
                 cation is the ARN of an event data store that receives events
                 from a channel. For service-linked channels, the location  is
                 the name of the Amazon Web Services service.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Location=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Type": "EVENT_DATA_STORE"|"AWS_SERVICE",
              "Location": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --name (string)
          Changes the name of the channel.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
