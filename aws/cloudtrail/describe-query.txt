DESCRIBE-QUERY()                                              DESCRIBE-QUERY()



NAME
       describe-query -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  metadata  about a query, including query run time in millisec-
       onds, number of events scanned and matched, and query status. You  must
       specify an ARN for EventDataStore , and a value for QueryID .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-query
          --event-data-store <value>
          --query-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --event-data-store (string)
          The  ARN  (or  the  ID  suffix of the ARN) of an event data store on
          which the specified query was run.

       --query-id (string)
          The query ID.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       QueryId -> (string)
          The ID of the query.

       QueryString -> (string)
          The SQL code of a query.

       QueryStatus -> (string)
          The  status of a query. Values for QueryStatus include QUEUED , RUN-
          NING , FINISHED , FAILED , TIMED_OUT , or CANCELLED

       QueryStatistics -> (structure)
          Metadata about a query, including the number  of  events  that  were
          matched,  the  total number of events scanned, the query run time in
          milliseconds, and the query's creation time.

          EventsMatched -> (long)
              The number of events that matched a query.

          EventsScanned -> (long)
              The number of events that the query scanned in  the  event  data
              store.

          BytesScanned -> (long)
              The  total bytes that the query scanned in the event data store.
              This value matches the number of bytes for which your account is
              billed for the query, unless the query is still running.

          ExecutionTimeInMillis -> (integer)
              The query's run time, in milliseconds.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The creation time of the query.

       ErrorMessage -> (string)
          The error message returned if a query failed.
