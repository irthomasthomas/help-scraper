DESCRIBE-QUERY()                                              DESCRIBE-QUERY()



NAME
       describe-query -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  metadata  about a query, including query run time in millisec-
       onds, number of events scanned and matched, and query  status.  If  the
       query  results  were  delivered to an S3 bucket, the response also pro-
       vides the S3 URI and the delivery status.

       You  must  specify  either  QueryId  or  QueryAlias  .  Specifying  the
       QueryAlias  parameter  returns information about the last query run for
       the alias. You can provide RefreshId along with QueryAlias to view  the
       query results of a dashboard query for the specified RefreshId .

OPTIONS
       --event-data-store (string)
          The  ARN  (or  the  ID  suffix of the ARN) of an event data store on
          which the specified query was run.

       --query-id (string)
          The query ID.

       --query-alias (string)
          The alias that identifies a query template.

       --refresh-id (string)
          The ID of the dashboard refresh.

       --event-data-store-owner-account-id (string)
          The account ID of the event data store owner.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

       QueryString -> (string)

          NING , FINISHED , FAILED , TIMED_OUT , or CANCELLED

       QueryStatistics -> (structure)
          Metadata  about  a  query,  including the number of events that were
          matched, the total number of events scanned, the query run  time  in
          milliseconds, and the query's creation time.

          EventsScanned -> (long)

              store.

          BytesScanned -> (long)
              The total bytes that the query scanned in the event data  store.
              This value matches the number of bytes for which your account is
              billed for the query, unless the query is still running.

          ExecutionTimeInMillis -> (integer)
              The query's run time, in milliseconds.
