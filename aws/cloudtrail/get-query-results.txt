OPTIONS
       --event-data-store (string)
          The ARN (or ID suffix of the ARN) of the event  data  store  against
          which the query was run.

       --query-id (string)
          The ID of the query for which you want to get results.

       --next-token (string)
          A token you can use to get the next page of query results.

       --max-query-results (integer)
          The maximum number of query results to display on a single page.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
