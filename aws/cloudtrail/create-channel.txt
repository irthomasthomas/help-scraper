CREATE-CHANNEL()                                              CREATE-CHANNEL()



NAME
       create-channel -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a channel for CloudTrail to ingest events from a partner or ex-
       ternal source. After you create a channel, a CloudTrail Lake event data
       store can log events from the partner or source that you specify.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the channel.

       --source (string)
          The  name of the partner or external event source. You cannot change
          this name after you create the channel. A maximum of one channel  is
          allowed per source.

          A  source can be either Custom for all valid non-Amazon Web Services
          events, or the name of a partner event source. For information about
          the  source names for available partners, see Additional information
          about integration partners in the CloudTrail User Guide.

       --destinations (list)
          One or more event data stores to which  events  arriving  through  a
          channel will be logged.

          (structure)
              Contains information about the destination receiving events.

              Type -> (string)
                 The  type  of destination for events arriving from a channel.
                 For channels used for  a  CloudTrail  Lake  integration,  the
                 value  is EVENT_DATA_STORE . For service-linked channels, the
                 value is AWS_SERVICE .

              Location -> (string)
                 For channels used for a CloudTrail Lake integration, the  lo-
                 cation is the ARN of an event data store that receives events
                 from a channel. For service-linked channels, the location  is
                 the name of the Amazon Web Services service.

          (structure)
              A  custom  key-value  pair  associated with a resource such as a
              CloudTrail trail, event data store, dashboard, or channel.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key in a key-value pair. The  key  must  be  must  be  no
                 longer  than  128  Unicode characters. The key must be unique
                 for the resource to which it applies.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value in a key-value pair of a tag. The value must be  no
                 longer than 256 Unicode characters.

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {

            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
