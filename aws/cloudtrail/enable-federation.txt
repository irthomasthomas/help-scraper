ENABLE-FEDERATION()                                        ENABLE-FEDERATION()



NAME
       enable-federation -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables Lake query federation on the specified event data store. Feder-
       ating an event data store lets you view the  metadata  associated  with
       the  event  data  store  in  the  Glue Data Catalog and run SQL queries
       against your event data using Amazon Athena. The table metadata  stored
       in the Glue Data Catalog lets the Athena query engine know how to find,
       read, and process the data that you want to query.

       When you enable Lake query federation,  CloudTrail  creates  a  managed
       database  named  aws:cloudtrail (if the database doesn't already exist)
       and a managed federated table in the Glue Data Catalog. The event  data
       store  ID is used for the table name. CloudTrail registers the role ARN
       and event data store in Lake Formation , the  service  responsible  for
       allowing  fine-grained access control of the federated resources in the
       Glue Data Catalog.

       For more information about Lake query federation, see Federate an event
       data store .

OPTIONS
       --event-data-store (string)
          The  ARN (or ID suffix of the ARN) of the event data store for which
          you want to enable Lake query federation.

       --federation-role-arn (string)
          The ARN of the federation role to use for the event data store. Ama-
          zon  Web  Services  services like Lake Formation use this federation
          role to access data for the federated event data store. The  federa-
          tion  role must exist in your account and provide the required mini-
          mum permissions .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       EventDataStoreArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the event data store for which  you  enabled  Lake  query
          federation.

       FederationStatus -> (string)
          The federation status.

       FederationRoleArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the federation role.
