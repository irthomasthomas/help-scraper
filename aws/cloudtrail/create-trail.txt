OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Specifies the name of the trail. The name must  meet  the  following
          requirements:

          o Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.),
            underscores (_), or dashes (-)

          o Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number

          o Be between 3 and 128 characters

          o Have no  adjacent  periods,  underscores  or  dashes.  Names  like
            my-_namespace and my--namespace are not valid.

          o Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)

       --s3-bucket-name (string)
          Specifies the name of the Amazon S3 bucket designated for publishing
          log files. See Amazon S3 Bucket Naming Requirements .

       --s3-key-prefix (string)
          Specifies the Amazon S3 key prefix that comes after the name of  the
          bucket  you have designated for log file delivery. For more informa-
          tion, see Finding Your CloudTrail Log Files . The maximum length  is
          200 characters.

       --sns-topic-name (string)
          Specifies  the name of the Amazon SNS topic defined for notification
          of log file delivery. The maximum length is 256 characters.

       --include-global-service-events  |   --no-include-global-service-events
       (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  the  trail is publishing events from global ser-
          vices such as IAM to the log files.

       --is-multi-region-trail | --no-is-multi-region-trail (boolean)
          Specifies whether the trail is created in the current region  or  in
          all regions. The default is false, which creates a trail only in the
          region where you are signed in. As a best practice, consider  creat-
          ing trails that log events in all regions.

       --enable-log-file-validation  |  --no-enable-log-file-validation (bool-
       ean)
          Specifies whether log file integrity validation is enabled. The  de-
          fault is false.

          NOTE:
              When you disable log file integrity validation, the chain of di-
              gest files is broken after one hour. CloudTrail does not  create
              digest  files  for log files that were delivered during a period
              in which log file integrity validation was disabled.  For  exam-
              ple, if you enable log file integrity validation at noon on Jan-
              uary 1, disable it at noon on January 2,  and  re-enable  it  at
              noon on January 10, digest files will not be created for the log
              files delivered from noon on January 2 to noon  on  January  10.
              The  same applies whenever you stop CloudTrail logging or delete
              a trail.

       --cloud-watch-logs-log-group-arn (string)
          Specifies a log group name using an Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN),  a
          unique  identifier that represents the log group to which CloudTrail
          logs will be delivered. You must use a log group that exists in your
          account.

          Not required unless you specify CloudWatchLogsRoleArn .

       --cloud-watch-logs-role-arn (string)
          Specifies  the  role  for  the CloudWatch Logs endpoint to assume to
          write to a user's log group. You must use a role that exists in your
          account.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          Specifies  the  KMS  key  ID to use to encrypt the logs delivered by
          CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by  alias/  ,  a
          fully  specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or
          a globally unique identifier.

          CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information
          about multi-Region keys, see Using multi-Region keys in the Key Man-
          agement Service Developer Guide .

          Examples:

          o alias/MyAliasName

          o arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName

          o arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

          o 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

       --is-organization-trail | --no-is-organization-trail (boolean)
          Specifies  whether the trail is created for all accounts in an orga-
          nization in Organizations, or only for the current Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices  account.  The default is false, and cannot be true unless the
          call is made on behalf of an Amazon Web Services account that is the
          management account or delegated administrator account for an organi-
          zation in Organizations.

       --tags-list (list)
          A list of tags.

          (structure)
              A custom key-value pair associated with a  resource  such  as  a
              CloudTrail trail, event data store, or channel.

              Key -> (string)
                 The  key  in  a  key-value  pair.  The key must be must be no
                 longer than 128 Unicode characters. The key  must  be  unique
                 for the resource to which it applies.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value in a key-value pair of a tag. The value must be no
                 longer than 256 Unicode characters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
