OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the event data store.

       --advanced-event-selectors (list)
          The  advanced  event  selectors  to use to select the events for the
          data store. You can configure up to five  advanced  event  selectors
          for each event data store.

          For  more  information  about how to use advanced event selectors to
          log CloudTrail events, see Log events by using advanced event selec-
          tors in the CloudTrail User Guide.

          For  more  information  about how to use advanced event selectors to
          include Config configuration items in your  event  data  store,  see
          Create  an  event  data  store for Config configuration items in the
          CloudTrail User Guide.

          For more information about how to use advanced  event  selectors  to
          include non-Amazon Web Services events in your event data store, see
          Create an integration to log events from outside Amazon Web Services
          in the CloudTrail User Guide.

          (structure)
              Advanced  event  selectors let you create fine-grained selectors
              for the following CloudTrail event record elds.  They  help  you
              control costs by logging only those events that are important to
              you. For more information about advanced  event  selectors,  see
              Logging data events in the CloudTrail User Guide .

              o readOnly

              o eventSource

              o eventName

              o eventCategory

              o resources.type

              o resources.ARN

              You  cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selec-
              tors to a trail.

              Name -> (string)
                 An optional, descriptive name for an advanced event selector,
                 such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets".

              FieldSelectors -> (list)
                 Contains  all selector statements in an advanced event selec-
                 tor.

                 (structure)
                     A single selector statement in an advanced  event  selec-
                     tor.

                     Field -> (string)
                        A  field in a CloudTrail event record on which to fil-
                        ter events to be logged. For  event  data  stores  for
                        Config configuration items, Audit Manager evidence, or
                        non-Amazon Web Services events, the field is used only
                        for selecting events as filtering is not supported.

                        For CloudTrail event records, supported fields include
                        readOnly , eventCategory , eventSource (for management
                        events),   eventName   ,   resources.type  ,  and  re-
                        sources.ARN .

                        For event data stores for Config configuration  items,
                        Audit  Manager  evidence,  or  non-Amazon Web Services
                        events, the only supported field is eventCategory .

                          **
                          readOnly ** - Optional. Can be set to Equals a value
                          of  true  or  false  . If you do not add this field,
                          CloudTrail logs both read and write events. A  value
                          of true logs only read events. A value of false logs
                          only write events.

                          the value of resources.type.  For  example,  if  re-
                          sources.type  equals  AWS::S3::Object , the ARN must
                          be in one of the following formats. To log all  data
                          events  for all objects in a specific S3 bucket, use
                          the StartsWith operator, and include only the bucket
                          ARN as the matching value. The trailing slash is in-

       --kms-key-id (string)
          Specifies  the  KMS key ID to use to encrypt the events delivered by
          CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by  alias/  ,  a

          a globally unique identifier.

          WARNING:
              Disabling or deleting the KMS key, or removing  CloudTrail  per-
              missions  on the key, prevents CloudTrail from logging events to
              the event data store, and prevents users from querying the  data
              in  the  event data store that was encrypted with the key. After
              you associate an event data store with a KMS key,  the  KMS  key
              cannot be removed or changed. Before you disable or delete a KMS
              key that you are using with an event data store, delete or  back
              up your event data store.

          CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information
          about multi-Region keys, see Using multi-Region keys in the Key Man-
          agement Service Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

              Advanced event selectors let you create  fine-grained  selectors
              for  the  following  CloudTrail event record elds. They help you
              control costs by logging only those events that are important to
              you.  For  more  information about advanced event selectors, see
              Logging data events in the CloudTrail User Guide .

              o resources.ARN

              You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event  selec-
              tors to a trail.

              Name -> (string)

                     tor.

                     Field -> (string)
                        A field in a CloudTrail event record on which to  fil-
                        ter  events  to  be  logged. For event data stores for
                        Config configuration items, Audit Manager evidence, or
                        non-Amazon Web Services events, the field is used only
                        for selecting events as filtering is not supported.

                        For CloudTrail event records, supported fields include
                        readOnly , eventCategory , eventSource (for management
                        events),  eventName  ,  resources.type   ,   and   re-
                        sources.ARN .

                        For  event data stores for Config configuration items,
                        Audit Manager evidence,  or  non-Amazon  Web  Services
                        events, the only supported field is eventCategory .

                          of true or false . If you do  not  add  this  field,
                          CloudTrail  logs both read and write events. A value
                          of true logs only read events. A value of false logs
                          only write events.

       UpdatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp that shows when an event data store  was  updated,  if
