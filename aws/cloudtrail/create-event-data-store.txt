OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the event data store.

       --advanced-event-selectors (list)
          The  advanced  event  selectors  to use to select the events for the
          data store. You can configure up to five  advanced  event  selectors
          for each event data store.

          For  more  information  about how to use advanced event selectors to
          log CloudTrail events, see Log events by using advanced event selec-
          tors in the CloudTrail User Guide.

          For  more  information  about how to use advanced event selectors to
          include Config configuration items in your  event  data  store,  see
          Create  an  event  data  store for Config configuration items in the
          CloudTrail User Guide.

          For more information about how to use advanced  event  selectors  to
          include  events  outside of Amazon Web Services events in your event
          data store, see Create an integration to  log  events  from  outside
          Amazon Web Services in the CloudTrail User Guide.

          (structure)
              Advanced  event  selectors let you create fine-grained selectors
              for CloudTrail management, data, and  network  activity  events.
              They  help  you  control costs by logging only those events that
              are important to you. For more information about configuring ad-
              vanced  event  selectors,  see the Logging data events , Logging
              network activity events , and Logging management  events  topics
              in the CloudTrail User Guide .

              You  cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selec-
              tors to a trail.

                        Amazon Web Services, the field is used  only  for  se-
                        lecting events as filtering is not supported.

                        For CloudTrail management events, supported fields in-
                        clude  eventCategory  (required),  eventSource  ,  and

                          used  for  management  events  and data events. This
                          field can be set to Equals with a value of  true  or
                          false  .  If  you  do not add this field, CloudTrail
                          logs both read and write events.  A  value  of  true
                          logs  only  read  events. A value of false logs only
                          write events.

                          only), and network activity events.  For  management
                          events  for  trails,  this is an optional field that
                          can be set to NotEquals   kms.amazonaws.com  to  ex-
                          clude  KMS  management  events,  or  NotEquals  rds-

                          For  management  and  data  events  for  event  data
                          stores, you can use it to  include  or  exclude  any
                          event  source  and can use any operator. For network
                          activity events, this is a required field that  only
                          uses  the  Equals  operator.  Set  this field to the
                          event source for which you want to log  network  ac-
                          tivity  events.  If you want to log network activity
                          events for multiple event sources, you must create a
                          separate  field  selector for each event source. The
                          following are  valid  values  for  network  activity
                          events:

                        (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "FieldSelectors": [
                {
                  "Field": "string",
                  "Equals": ["string", ...],

              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --multi-region-enabled | --no-multi-region-enabled (boolean)
          Specifies whether the event data store includes events from all  Re-
          gions, or only from the Region in which the event data store is cre-
          ated.

       --organization-enabled | --no-organization-enabled (boolean)
          Specifies whether an event data store collects events logged for  an
          organization in Organizations.

       --retention-period (integer)
          The  retention  period of the event data store, in days. If Billing-
          Mode is set to EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING , you can set  a  reten-
          tion  period  of  up  to  3653  days, the equivalent of 10 years. If
          BillingMode is set to FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING , you can set a reten-
          tion period of up to 2557 days, the equivalent of seven years.

          CloudTrail Lake determines whether to retain an event by checking if
          the eventTime of the event is within the specified retention period.
          For  example,  if  you set a retention period of 90 days, CloudTrail
          will remove events when the eventTime is older than 90 days.

          NOTE:
              If you plan to copy trail events to this event  data  store,  we
              recommend  that you consider both the age of the events that you
              want to copy as well as how long you want  to  keep  the  copied
              events  in your event data store. For example, if you copy trail
              events that are 5 years old and specify a retention period of  7
              years,  the  event  data  store will retain those events for two
              years.

       --termination-protection-enabled |  --no-termination-protection-enabled
       (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  termination  protection is enabled for the event
          data store. If termination protection is enabled, you cannot  delete
          the event data store until termination protection is disabled.

       --tags-list (list)
          A list of tags.

          (structure)
              A  custom  key-value  pair  associated with a resource such as a
              CloudTrail trail, event data store, dashboard, or channel.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key in a key-value pair. The  key  must  be  must  be  no
                 longer  than  128  Unicode characters. The key must be unique
                 for the resource to which it applies.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value in a key-value pair of a tag. The value must be  no
                 longer than 256 Unicode characters.

            {
              "Key": "string",

            }
            ...
          ]

       --kms-key-id (string)
          Specifies  the  KMS key ID to use to encrypt the events delivered by
          CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by  alias/  ,  a
          fully  specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or
          a globally unique identifier.

          WARNING:
              Disabling or deleting the KMS key, or removing  CloudTrail  per-
              missions  on the key, prevents CloudTrail from logging events to
              the event data store, and prevents users from querying the  data
              in  the  event data store that was encrypted with the key. After
              you associate an event data store with a KMS key,  the  KMS  key
              cannot be removed or changed. Before you disable or delete a KMS
              key that you are using with an event data store, delete or  back
              up your event data store.

          CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information
          about multi-Region keys, see Using multi-Region keys in the Key Man-
          agement Service Developer Guide .

          Examples:

          o alias/MyAliasName

          o arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName

          o arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

          o 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

       --start-ingestion | --no-start-ingestion (boolean)
          Specifies whether the event data store should start  ingesting  live
          events. The default is true.

       --billing-mode (string)
          The  billing  mode  for the event data store determines the cost for
          ingesting events and the default and maximum  retention  period  for
          the event data store.

          The following are the possible values:

          o EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING - This billing mode is generally rec-
            ommended if you want a flexible retention period  of  up  to  3653
            days  (about  10  years).  The  default  retention period for this
            billing mode is 366 days.

          o FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING - This billing mode is recommended if  you
            expect  to ingest more than 25 TB of event data per month and need
            a retention period of up to 2557 days (about 7 years). The default
            retention period for this billing mode is 2557 days.

          The default value is EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING .

          o FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

              for CloudTrail management, data, and  network  activity  events.
              They  help  you  control costs by logging only those events that
              are important to you. For more information about configuring ad-
              vanced  event  selectors,  see the Logging data events , Logging
              network activity events , and Logging management  events  topics
              in the CloudTrail User Guide .

              You  cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selec-
              tors to a trail.
