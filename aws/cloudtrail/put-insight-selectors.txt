PUT-INSIGHT-SELECTORS()                                PUT-INSIGHT-SELECTORS()



NAME
       put-insight-selectors -

DESCRIPTION
       Lets  you  enable Insights event logging by specifying the Insights se-
       lectors that you want to enable on an  existing  trail  or  event  data
       store. You also use PutInsightSelectors to turn off Insights event log-
       ging, by passing an empty list of Insights types.  The  valid  Insights
       event types are ApiErrorRateInsight and ApiCallRateInsight .

       To  enable  Insights  on an event data store, you must specify the ARNs
       (or ID suffix of the ARNs) for the source event data store (EventDataS-
       tore ) and the destination event data store (InsightsDestination ). The
       source event data store logs management events  and  enables  Insights.
       The  destination  event  data store logs Insights events based upon the
       management event activity of the source event data  store.  The  source
       and  destination  event  data stores must belong to the same Amazon Web
       Services account.

       To log Insights events for a trail, you must specify the  name  (Trail-
       Name  ) of the CloudTrail trail for which you want to change or add In-
       sights selectors.

       To log CloudTrail Insights events on API  call  volume,  the  trail  or
       event  data  store  must log write management events. To log CloudTrail
       Insights events on API error rate, the trail or event data  store  must
       log  read or write management events. You can call GetEventSelectors on
       a trail to check whether the trail logs management events. You can call
       GetEventDataStore  on  an  event  data store to check whether the event
       data store logs management events.

       For more information, see Logging CloudTrail  Insights  events  in  the
       CloudTrail User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --trail-name (string)
          The name of the CloudTrail trail for which you want to change or add
          Insights selectors.

          You cannot use this parameter with the EventDataStore and  Insights-
          Destination parameters.

       --insight-selectors (list)
          A  JSON string that contains the Insights types you want to log on a
          trail or event data store.  ApiCallRateInsight  and  ApiErrorRateIn-
          sight are valid Insight types.

          The  ApiCallRateInsight Insights type analyzes write-only management
          API calls that are aggregated per minute against a baseline API call
          volume.

          The  ApiErrorRateInsight Insights type analyzes management API calls
          that result in error codes. The error is shown if the  API  call  is
          unsuccessful.

          (structure)
              A  JSON  string  that contains a list of Insights types that are
              logged on a trail or event data store.

              InsightType -> (string)
                 The type of Insights events to log on a trail or  event  data
                 store.  ApiCallRateInsight  and ApiErrorRateInsight are valid
                 Insight types.

                 The ApiCallRateInsight Insights type analyzes write-only man-
                 agement  API  calls  that are aggregated per minute against a
                 baseline API call volume.

                 The ApiErrorRateInsight Insights type analyzes management API
                 calls  that  result in error codes. The error is shown if the
                 API call is unsuccessful.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InsightType=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "InsightType": "ApiCallRateInsight"|"ApiErrorRateInsight"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --event-data-store (string)
          The ARN (or ID suffix of the ARN) of the source event data store for
          which  you  want  to change or add Insights selectors. To enable In-
          sights on an event data store, you must provide both the EventDataS-
          tore and InsightsDestination parameters.

          You cannot use this parameter with the TrailName parameter.

       --insights-destination (string)
          The  ARN  (or  ID  suffix  of the ARN) of the destination event data
          store that logs Insights events. To enable Insights on an event data
          store, you must provide both the EventDataStore and InsightsDestina-
          tion parameters.

          You cannot use this parameter with the TrailName parameter.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
