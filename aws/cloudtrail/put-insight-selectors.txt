PUT-INSIGHT-SELECTORS()                                PUT-INSIGHT-SELECTORS()



NAME
       put-insight-selectors -

DESCRIPTION
       Lets  you  enable Insights event logging by specifying the Insights se-
       lectors that you want to enable on an  existing  trail.  You  also  use
       PutInsightSelectors  to  turn off Insights event logging, by passing an
       empty list of insight types. The valid Insights event types in this re-
       lease are ApiErrorRateInsight and ApiCallRateInsight .

       To  log  CloudTrail  Insights events on API call volume, the trail must
       log write management events. To log CloudTrail Insights events  on  API
       error rate, the trail must log read or write management events. You can
       call GetEventSelectors on a trail to check whether the trail logs  man-
       agement events.

OPTIONS
       --trail-name (string)
          The name of the CloudTrail trail for which you want to change or add
          Insights selectors.

       --insight-selectors (list)
          A JSON string that contains the insight types you want to log  on  a
          trail.  ApiCallRateInsight and ApiErrorRateInsight are valid Insight
          types.

          The ApiCallRateInsight Insights type analyzes write-only  management
          API calls that are aggregated per minute against a baseline API call
          volume.

          The ApiErrorRateInsight Insights type analyzes management API  calls
          that  result  in  error codes. The error is shown if the API call is
          unsuccessful.

          (structure)
              A JSON string that contains a list of Insights  types  that  are
              logged on a trail.

              InsightType -> (string)
                 The type of Insights events to log on a trail. ApiCallRateIn-
                 sight and ApiErrorRateInsight are valid Insight types.

                 The ApiCallRateInsight Insights type analyzes write-only man-
                 agement  API  calls  that are aggregated per minute against a
                 baseline API call volume.

                 The ApiErrorRateInsight Insights type analyzes management API
                 calls  that  result in error codes. The error is shown if the
                 API call is unsuccessful.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InsightType=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "InsightType": "ApiCallRateInsight"|"ApiErrorRateInsight"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

       InsightSelectors -> (list)
          A JSON string that contains the Insights event types that  you  want

                 sight and ApiErrorRateInsight are valid Insight types.

                 The ApiCallRateInsight Insights type analyzes write-only man-
                 agement  API  calls  that are aggregated per minute against a
                 baseline API call volume.

                 The ApiErrorRateInsight Insights type analyzes management API
