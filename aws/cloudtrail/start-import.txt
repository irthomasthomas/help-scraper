START-IMPORT()                                                  START-IMPORT()



NAME
       start-import -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  an  import  of logged trail events from a source S3 bucket to a
       destination event data  store.  By  default,  CloudTrail  only  imports
       events  contained in the S3 bucket's CloudTrail prefix and the prefixes
       inside the CloudTrail prefix, and does not  check  prefixes  for  other
       Amazon  Web  Services services. If you want to import CloudTrail events
       contained in another prefix, you must include the prefix in the S3Loca-
       tionUri  .  For  more  considerations about importing trail events, see
       Considerations for copying trail events in the CloudTrail User Guide .

       When you start a new import, the Destinations and ImportSource  parame-
       ters  are  required.  Before  starting a new import, disable any access
       control lists (ACLs) attached to the source S3 bucket. For more  infor-
       mation  about  disabling ACLs, see Controlling ownership of objects and
       disabling ACLs for your bucket .

       When you retry an import, the ImportID parameter is required.

       NOTE:
          If the destination event data store is for an organization, you must
          use  the  management  account to import trail events. You cannot use
          the delegated administrator account for the organization.

OPTIONS
       --destinations (list)
          The ARN of the destination event data store. Use this parameter  for
          a new import.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --import-source (structure)
          The  source  S3  bucket for the import. Use this parameter for a new
          import.

          S3 -> (structure)
              The source S3 bucket.

              S3LocationUri -> (string)
                 The URI for the source S3 bucket.

              S3BucketRegion -> (string)
                 The Region associated with the source S3 bucket.

              S3BucketAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The IAM ARN role used to access the source S3 bucket.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3={S3LocationUri=string,S3BucketRegion=string,S3BucketAccessRoleArn=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3": {
              "S3LocationUri": "string",
              "S3BucketRegion": "string",
              "S3BucketAccessRoleArn": "string"
            }
          }

       --start-event-time (timestamp)
          Use with EndEventTime to bound a StartImport request, and limit  im-
          ported  trail  events to only those events logged within a specified
          time period. When you specify a time range,  CloudTrail  checks  the
          prefix and log file names to verify the names contain a date between
          the specified StartEventTime and EndEventTime before  attempting  to
          import events.

       --end-event-time (timestamp)
          Use  with  StartEventTime  to bound a StartImport request, and limit
          imported trail events to only those events logged within a specified
          time  period.  When  you specify a time range, CloudTrail checks the
          prefix and log file names to verify the names contain a date between
          the  specified  StartEventTime and EndEventTime before attempting to
          import events.

       --import-id (string)
          The ID of the import. Use this parameter when you  are  retrying  an
          import.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.
