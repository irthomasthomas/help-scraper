PUT-EVENT-SELECTORS()                                    PUT-EVENT-SELECTORS()



NAME
       put-event-selectors -

DESCRIPTION
       Configures event selectors (also referred to as basic event selectors )
       or advanced event selectors for your trail.  You  can  use  either  Ad-
       vancedEventSelectors or EventSelectors , but not both. If you apply Ad-
       vancedEventSelectors to a trail, any existing EventSelectors are  over-
       written.

       You  can  use  AdvancedEventSelectors  to  log  management events, data
       events for all resource types, and network activity events.

       You can use EventSelectors to log management events and data events for
       the following resource types:

       o AWS::DynamoDB::Table

       o AWS::Lambda::Function

       o AWS::S3::Object

       You can't use EventSelectors to log network activity events.

       If you want your trail to log Insights events, be sure the event selec-
       tor or advanced event selector enables logging of  the  Insights  event
       types  you  want  configured for your trail. For more information about
       logging Insights events, see Logging Insights events in the  CloudTrail
       User  Guide  . By default, trails created without specific event selec-
       tors are configured to log all read and write management events, and no
       data events or network activity events.

       When  an  event  occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event
       selectors or advanced event selectors in all trails. For each trail, if
       the  event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the
       event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail doesn't
       log the event.

       Example

       o You create an event selector for a trail and specify that you want to
         log write-only events.

       o The EC2 GetConsoleOutput and RunInstances  API  operations  occur  in
         your account.

       o CloudTrail evaluates whether the events match your event selectors.

       o The  RunInstances is a write-only event and it matches your event se-
         lector. The trail logs the event.

       o The GetConsoleOutput is a read-only event  that  doesn't  match  your
         event selector. The trail doesn't log the event.

       The PutEventSelectors operation must be called from the Region in which
       the trail was created; otherwise, an InvalidHomeRegionException  excep-
       tion is thrown.

       You can configure up to five event selectors for each trail.

       You  can add advanced event selectors, and conditions for your advanced
       event selectors, up to a maximum of 500 values for all  conditions  and
       selectors  on  a  trail.  For  more information, see Logging management
       events , Logging data events , Logging network activity  events  ,  and
       Quotas in CloudTrail in the CloudTrail User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --trail-name (string)
          Specifies the name of the trail or trail ARN. If you specify a trail
          name, the string must meet the following requirements:

          o Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.),
            underscores (_), or dashes (-)

          o Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number

          o Be between 3 and 128 characters

          o Have  no  adjacent  periods,  underscores  or  dashes.  Names like
            my-_namespace and my--namespace are not valid.

          o Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)

          If you specify a trail ARN, it must be in the following format.
              arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail

       --event-selectors (list)
          Specifies the settings for your event selectors. You can  use  event
          selectors to log management events and data events for the following
          resource types:

          o AWS::DynamoDB::Table

          o AWS::Lambda::Function

          o AWS::S3::Object

          You can't use event selectors to log network activity events.

          You can configure up to five event selectors for a  trail.  You  can
          use either EventSelectors or AdvancedEventSelectors in a PutEventSe-
          lectors request, but not both. If  you  apply  EventSelectors  to  a
          trail, any existing AdvancedEventSelectors are overwritten.

          (structure)
              Use  event  selectors to further specify the management and data
              event settings for your trail. By default, trails created  with-
              out  specific event selectors will be configured to log all read
              and write management events, and no data events. When  an  event
              occurs  in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selector
              for all trails. For each trail, if the event matches  any  event
              selector,  the  trail processes and logs the event. If the event
              doesn't match any event selector,  the  trail  doesn't  log  the
              event.

              You can configure up to five event selectors for a trail.

              You  cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selec-
              tors to a trail.

              ReadWriteType -> (string)
                 Specify if you want  your  trail  to  log  read-only  events,
                 write-only  events,  or all. For example, the EC2 GetConsole-
                 Output is a read-only API operation  and  RunInstances  is  a
                 write-only API operation.

                 By default, the value is All .

              IncludeManagementEvents -> (boolean)
                 Specify if you want your event selector to include management
                 events for your trail.

                 For more information, see Management Events in the CloudTrail
                 User Guide .

                 By default, the value is true .

                 The  first copy of management events is free. You are charged
                 for additional copies of management events that you are  log-
                 ging on any subsequent trail in the same Region. For more in-
                 formation about CloudTrail pricing, see CloudTrail Pricing .

              DataResources -> (list)
                 CloudTrail supports data event logging for Amazon S3  objects
                 in standard S3 buckets, Lambda functions, and Amazon DynamoDB
                 tables with basic event selectors. You can specify up to  250
                 resources  for  an  individual  event selector, but the total
                 number of data resources cannot exceed 250 across  all  event
                 selectors  in  a trail. This limit does not apply if you con-
                 figure resource logging for all data events.

                 For more information, see Data Events and  Limits  in  Cloud-
                 Trail in the CloudTrail User Guide .

                 NOTE:
                     To log data events for all other resource types including
                     objects stored  in  directory  buckets  ,  you  must  use
                     AdvancedEventSelectors  .  You  must  also use AdvancedE-
                     ventSelectors if you want  to  filter  on  the  eventName
                     field.

                 (structure)
                     You can configure the DataResource in an EventSelector to
                     log data events for the following three resource types:

                     o AWS::DynamoDB::Table

                     o AWS::Lambda::Function

                     o AWS::S3::Object

                     To log data events for all other resource types including
                     objects  stored  in  directory  buckets  ,  you  must use
                     AdvancedEventSelectors . You  must  also  use  AdvancedE-
                     ventSelectors  if  you  want  to  filter on the eventName
                     field.

                     Configure the DataResource to specify the  resource  type
                     and resource ARNs for which you want to log data events.

                     NOTE:
                        The  total  number  of  allowed data resources is 250.
                        This number can be distributed between 1 and  5  event
                        selectors,  but the total cannot exceed 250 across all
                        selectors for the trail.

                     The following example demonstrates how logging works when
                     you  configure  logging  of all data events for a general
                     purpose bucket named amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 . In this exam-
                     ple,  the  CloudTrail user specified an empty prefix, and
                     the option to log both Read and Write data events.

                     o A user uploads an image file to amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 .

                     o The  PutObject  API  operation  is  an  Amazon  S3  ob-
                       ject-level  API.  It  is  recorded  as  a data event in
                       CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified an S3
                       bucket  with  an empty prefix, events that occur on any
                       object in that bucket are logged. The  trail  processes
                       and logs the event.

                     o A  user  uploads an object to an Amazon S3 bucket named
                       arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 .

                     o The PutObject API operation occurred for an  object  in
                       an  S3  bucket  that the CloudTrail user didn't specify
                       for the trail. The trail doesnt log the event.

                     The following example demonstrates how logging works when
                     you  configure logging of Lambda data events for a Lambda
                     function named MyLambdaFunction , but not for all  Lambda
                     functions.

                     o A  user  runs  a script that includes a call to the My-
                       LambdaFunction function and  the  MyOtherLambdaFunction
                       function.

                     o The  Invoke  API  operation  on  MyLambdaFunction is an
                       Lambda API. It is recorded as a data  event  in  Cloud-
                       Trail.  Because  the  CloudTrail user specified logging
                       data events for MyLambdaFunction , any  invocations  of
                       that  function are logged. The trail processes and logs
                       the event.

                     o The Invoke API operation on MyOtherLambdaFunction is an
                       Lambda API. Because the CloudTrail user did not specify
                       logging data events for all Lambda functions,  the  In-
                       voke operation for MyOtherLambdaFunction does not match
                       the function specified for the trail. The trail  doesnt
                       log the event.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The  resource  type  in  which  you  want  to log data
                        events. You can specify the following basic event  se-
                        lector resource types:

                        o AWS::DynamoDB::Table

                        o AWS::Lambda::Function

                        o AWS::S3::Object

                        Additional  resource  types  are available through ad-
                        vanced event  selectors.  For  more  information,  see
                        AdvancedEventSelector .

                     Values -> (list)
                        An array of Amazon Resource Name (ARN) strings or par-
                        tial ARN strings for the specified resource type.

                        o To log data events for all objects in all S3 buckets
                          in  your  Amazon  Web  Services account, specify the
                          prefix as arn:aws:s3 .

                        NOTE:
                            This also enables logging of data  event  activity
                            performed  by  any user or role in your Amazon Web
                            Services account, even if that  activity  is  per-
                            formed  on a bucket that belongs to another Amazon
                            Web Services account.

                        o To log data events for all objects in an S3  bucket,
                          specify  the  bucket and an empty object prefix such
                          as arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1/  .  The  trail
                          logs data events for all objects in this S3 bucket.

                        o To log data events for specific objects, specify the
                          S3   bucket    and    object    prefix    such    as
                          arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1/example-images   .
                          The trail logs data events for objects  in  this  S3
                          bucket that match the prefix.

                        o To  log data events for all Lambda functions in your
                          Amazon Web Services account, specify the  prefix  as
                          arn:aws:lambda .

                        NOTE:
                            This  also enables logging of Invoke activity per-
                            formed by any user or role in your Amazon Web Ser-
                            vices  account, even if that activity is performed
                            on a function that belongs to another  Amazon  Web
                            Services account.

                        o To  log  data events for a specific Lambda function,
                          specify the function ARN.

                        NOTE:
                            Lambda function ARNs are exact.  For  example,  if
                            you       specify       a       function       ARN
                            arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:func-
                            tion:helloworld  , data events will only be logged
                            for    arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:func-
                            tion:helloworld  .  They  will  not  be logged for
                            arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:func-
                            tion:helloworld2 .

                        o To  log  data events for all DynamoDB tables in your
                          Amazon Web Services account, specify the  prefix  as
                          arn:aws:dynamodb .

                        (string)

              ExcludeManagementEventSources -> (list)
                 An  optional  list of service event sources from which you do
                 not want management events to be logged  on  your  trail.  In
                 this release, the list can be empty (disables the filter), or
                 it can filter out Key Management Service or Amazon  RDS  Data
                 API events by containing kms.amazonaws.com or rdsdata.amazon-
                 aws.com . By default, ExcludeManagementEventSources is empty,
                 and  KMS  and  Amazon  RDS Data API events are logged to your
                 trail. You can exclude management event sources only  in  Re-
                 gions that support the event source.

                 (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ReadWriteType": "ReadOnly"|"WriteOnly"|"All",
              "IncludeManagementEvents": true|false,
              "DataResources": [
                {
                  "Type": "string",
                  "Values": ["string", ...]
                }
                ...
              ],
              "ExcludeManagementEventSources": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --advanced-event-selectors (list)
          Specifies the settings for advanced event selectors. You can use ad-
          vanced event selectors to log management events, data events for all
          resource types, and network activity events.

          You  can  add  advanced event selectors, and conditions for your ad-
          vanced event selectors, up to a maximum of 500 values for all condi-
          tions  and selectors on a trail. You can use either AdvancedEventSe-
          lectors or EventSelectors , but not both. If  you  apply  AdvancedE-
          ventSelectors  to a trail, any existing EventSelectors are overwrit-
          ten. For  more  information  about  advanced  event  selectors,  see
          Logging  data  events  and  Logging  network  activity events in the
          CloudTrail User Guide .

          (structure)
              Advanced event selectors let you create  fine-grained  selectors
              for  CloudTrail  management,  data, and network activity events.
              They help you control costs by logging only  those  events  that
              are important to you. For more information about configuring ad-
              vanced event selectors, see the Logging data  events  ,  Logging
              network  activity  events , and Logging management events topics
              in the CloudTrail User Guide .

              You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event  selec-
              tors to a trail.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: Configure a trail to log management events and  data  events
       by using advanced event selectors

       You  can add advanced event selectors, and conditions for your advanced
       event selectors, up to a maximum of 500 values for all  conditions  and
       selectors  on  a trail. You can use advanced event selectors to log all
       available data event types. You can use either advanced event selectors
       or basic event selectors, but not both. If you apply advanced event se-
       lectors to a trail, any existing basic event selectors are overwritten.

       The following example creates an advanced event selector  for  a  trail
       named  myTrail to log all management events, log S3 PutObject and Dele-
       teObject API calls for all but one S3 bucket, log data API calls for  a
       Lambda  function  named myFunction, and log Publish API calls on an SNS
       topic named myTopic.

       For more information, see Log events by using advanced event  selectors
       in the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.

       Example  2: Configure event selectors for a trail to log all management
       events and data events

       You can configure up to 5 event selectors for a trail  and  up  to  250
       data resources for a trail. Event selectors are also referred to as ba-
       sic event selectors. You can use  event  selectors  to  log  management
       events  and data events for S3 objects, Lambda functions, and DynnamoDB
       tables. To log data events for other resource types, you must  use  ad-
       vanced event selectors.

       The  following  example  creates  an  event  selector for a trail named
       TrailName to include all management events, data events for two  Amazon
       S3  bucket/prefix combinations, and data events for a single AWS Lambda
       function named hello-world-python-function.

          aws cloudtrail put-event-selectors \
              --trail-name TrailName \
              --event-selectors '[{"ReadWriteType": "All","IncludeManagementEvents": true,"DataResources": [{"Type":"AWS::S3::Object", "Values": ["arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/prefix","arn:aws:s3:::mybucket2/prefix2"]},{"Type": "AWS::Lambda::Function","Values": ["arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:999999999999:function:hello-world-python-function"]}]}]'

       Output:

          {
              "EventSelectors": [
                  {
                      "IncludeManagementEvents": true,
                      "DataResources": [
                          {
                              "Values": [
                                  "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/prefix",
                                  "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket2/prefix2"

                              "Type": "AWS::S3::Object"
                          },
                          {
                              "Values": [
                                  "arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:hello-world-python-function"
                              ],
                              "Type": "AWS::Lambda::Function"
                          },
                      ],
                      "ReadWriteType": "All"
                  }
              ],
              "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/TrailName"
          }

       For more information, see Log events by using basic event selectors  in
       the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.

       Example  3:  Configure  event  selectors  for a trail to log management
       events, all S3 data events on S3 objects, and all Lambda data events on
       functions in your account

       The  following  example  creates  an  event  selector for a trail named
       TrailName2 that includes all management events, and all data events for
       all Amazon S3 buckets and AWS Lambda functions in the AWS account.

          aws cloudtrail put-event-selectors \
              --trail-name TrailName2 \
              --event-selectors '[{"ReadWriteType": "All","IncludeManagementEvents": true,"DataResources": [{"Type":"AWS::S3::Object", "Values": ["arn:aws:s3"]},{"Type": "AWS::Lambda::Function","Values": ["arn:aws:lambda"]}]}]'

       Output:

          {
              "EventSelectors": [
                  {
                      "IncludeManagementEvents": true,
                      "DataResources": [

          }

       For  more information, see Log events by using basic event selectors in
       the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.

OUTPUT
       TrailARN -> (string)
          Specifies the ARN of the trail that was updated  with  event  selec-
          tors. The following is the format of a trail ARN.
              arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail

       EventSelectors -> (list)
          Specifies the event selectors configured for your trail.

          (structure)
              Use  event  selectors to further specify the management and data
              event settings for your trail. By default, trails created  with-
              out  specific event selectors will be configured to log all read
              and write management events, and no data events. When  an  event
              occurs  in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selector
              for all trails. For each trail, if the event matches  any  event
              selector,  the  trail processes and logs the event. If the event
              doesn't match any event selector,  the  trail  doesn't  log  the
              event.

              You can configure up to five event selectors for a trail.

              You  cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selec-
              tors to a trail.

              ReadWriteType -> (string)
                 Specify if you want  your  trail  to  log  read-only  events,
                 write-only  events,  or all. For example, the EC2 GetConsole-
                 Output is a read-only API operation  and  RunInstances  is  a
                 write-only API operation.

                 By default, the value is All .

              IncludeManagementEvents -> (boolean)
                 Specify if you want your event selector to include management
                 events for your trail.

                 For more information, see Management Events in the CloudTrail
                 User Guide .

                 By default, the value is true .

                 The  first copy of management events is free. You are charged
                 for additional copies of management events that you are  log-
                 ging on any subsequent trail in the same Region. For more in-
                 formation about CloudTrail pricing, see CloudTrail Pricing .

              DataResources -> (list)
                 CloudTrail supports data event logging for Amazon S3  objects
                 in standard S3 buckets, Lambda functions, and Amazon DynamoDB
                 tables with basic event selectors. You can specify up to  250
                 resources  for  an  individual  event selector, but the total
                 number of data resources cannot exceed 250 across  all  event
                 selectors  in  a trail. This limit does not apply if you con-
                 figure resource logging for all data events.

                 For more information, see Data Events and  Limits  in  Cloud-
                 Trail in the CloudTrail User Guide .

                 NOTE:
                     To log data events for all other resource types including
                     objects stored  in  directory  buckets  ,  you  must  use
                     AdvancedEventSelectors  .  You  must  also use AdvancedE-
                     ventSelectors if you want  to  filter  on  the  eventName
                     field.

                 (structure)
                     You can configure the DataResource in an EventSelector to
                     log data events for the following three resource types:

                     o AWS::DynamoDB::Table

                     o AWS::Lambda::Function

                     o AWS::S3::Object

                     To log data events for all other resource types including
                     objects  stored  in  directory  buckets  ,  you  must use
                     AdvancedEventSelectors . You  must  also  use  AdvancedE-
                     ventSelectors  if  you  want  to  filter on the eventName
                     field.

                     Configure the DataResource to specify the  resource  type
                     and resource ARNs for which you want to log data events.

                     NOTE:
                        The  total  number  of  allowed data resources is 250.
                        This number can be distributed between 1 and  5  event
                        selectors,  but the total cannot exceed 250 across all
                        selectors for the trail.

                     The following example demonstrates how logging works when
                     you  configure  logging  of all data events for a general
                     purpose bucket named amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 . In this exam-
                     ple,  the  CloudTrail user specified an empty prefix, and
                     the option to log both Read and Write data events.

                     o A user uploads an image file to amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 .

                     o The  PutObject  API  operation  is  an  Amazon  S3  ob-
                       ject-level  API.  It  is  recorded  as  a data event in
                       CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified an S3
                       bucket  with  an empty prefix, events that occur on any
                       object in that bucket are logged. The  trail  processes
                       and logs the event.

                     o A  user  uploads an object to an Amazon S3 bucket named
                       arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 .

                     o The PutObject API operation occurred for an  object  in
                       an  S3  bucket  that the CloudTrail user didn't specify
                       for the trail. The trail doesnt log the event.

                     The following example demonstrates how logging works when
                     you  configure logging of Lambda data events for a Lambda
                     function named MyLambdaFunction , but not for all  Lambda
                     functions.

                     o A  user  runs  a script that includes a call to the My-
                       LambdaFunction function and  the  MyOtherLambdaFunction
                       function.

                     o The  Invoke  API  operation  on  MyLambdaFunction is an
                       Lambda API. It is recorded as a data  event  in  Cloud-
                       Trail.  Because  the  CloudTrail user specified logging
                       data events for MyLambdaFunction , any  invocations  of
                       that  function are logged. The trail processes and logs
                       the event.

                     o The Invoke API operation on MyOtherLambdaFunction is an
                       Lambda API. Because the CloudTrail user did not specify
                       logging data events for all Lambda functions,  the  In-
                       voke operation for MyOtherLambdaFunction does not match
                       the function specified for the trail. The trail  doesnt
                       log the event.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The  resource  type  in  which  you  want  to log data
                        events. You can specify the following basic event  se-
                        lector resource types:

                        o AWS::DynamoDB::Table

                        o AWS::Lambda::Function

                        o AWS::S3::Object

                        Additional  resource  types  are available through ad-
                        vanced event  selectors.  For  more  information,  see
                        AdvancedEventSelector .

                     Values -> (list)
                        An array of Amazon Resource Name (ARN) strings or par-
                        tial ARN strings for the specified resource type.

                        o To log data events for all objects in all S3 buckets
                          in  your  Amazon  Web  Services account, specify the
                          prefix as arn:aws:s3 .

                        NOTE:
                            This also enables logging of data  event  activity
                            performed  by  any user or role in your Amazon Web
                            Services account, even if that  activity  is  per-
                            formed  on a bucket that belongs to another Amazon
                            Web Services account.

                        o To log data events for all objects in an S3  bucket,
                          specify  the  bucket and an empty object prefix such
                          as arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1/  .  The  trail
                          logs data events for all objects in this S3 bucket.

                        o To log data events for specific objects, specify the
                          S3   bucket    and    object    prefix    such    as
                          arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1/example-images   .
                          The trail logs data events for objects  in  this  S3
                          bucket that match the prefix.

                        o To  log data events for all Lambda functions in your
                          Amazon Web Services account, specify the  prefix  as
                          arn:aws:lambda .

                        NOTE:
                            This  also enables logging of Invoke activity per-
                            formed by any user or role in your Amazon Web Ser-
                            vices  account, even if that activity is performed
                            on a function that belongs to another  Amazon  Web
                            Services account.

                        o To  log  data events for a specific Lambda function,
                          specify the function ARN.

                        NOTE:
                            Lambda function ARNs are exact.  For  example,  if
                            you       specify       a       function       ARN
                            arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:func-
                            tion:helloworld  , data events will only be logged
                            for    arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:func-
                            tion:helloworld  .  They  will  not  be logged for
                            arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:func-
                            tion:helloworld2 .

                        o To  log  data events for all DynamoDB tables in your
                          Amazon Web Services account, specify the  prefix  as
                          arn:aws:dynamodb .

                        (string)

              ExcludeManagementEventSources -> (list)
                 An  optional  list of service event sources from which you do
                 not want management events to be logged  on  your  trail.  In
                 this release, the list can be empty (disables the filter), or
                 it can filter out Key Management Service or Amazon  RDS  Data
                 API events by containing kms.amazonaws.com or rdsdata.amazon-
                 aws.com . By default, ExcludeManagementEventSources is empty,
                 and  KMS  and  Amazon  RDS Data API events are logged to your
                 trail. You can exclude management event sources only  in  Re-
                 gions that support the event source.

                 (string)

       AdvancedEventSelectors -> (list)
          Specifies the advanced event selectors configured for your trail.

          (structure)
              Advanced  event  selectors let you create fine-grained selectors
              for CloudTrail management, data, and  network  activity  events.
              They  help  you  control costs by logging only those events that
              are important to you. For more information about configuring ad-
              vanced  event  selectors,  see the Logging data events , Logging
              network activity events , and Logging management  events  topics
              in the CloudTrail User Guide .

              You  cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selec-
              tors to a trail.

              NOTE:
                 For event data stores for CloudTrail Insights events,  Config
                 configuration  items,  Audit Manager evidence, or events out-
                 side of Amazon Web Services,  the  only  supported  field  is
                 eventCategory .

              Name -> (string)
                 An optional, descriptive name for an advanced event selector,
                 such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets".

                        A field in a CloudTrail event record on which to  fil-
                        ter  events  to  be  logged. For event data stores for
                        CloudTrail  Insights  events,   Config   configuration
                        items,  Audit  Manager  evidence, or events outside of
                        Amazon Web Services, the field is used  only  for  se-
                        lecting events as filtering is not supported.

                        For CloudTrail management events, supported fields in-
                        clude  eventCategory  (required),  eventSource  ,  and
