PUT-EVENT-SELECTORS()                                    PUT-EVENT-SELECTORS()



NAME
       put-event-selectors -

DESCRIPTION
       Configures  an  event  selector  or  advanced  event selectors for your
       trail. Use event selectors or advanced event selectors to specify  man-
       agement  and data event settings for your trail. If you want your trail
       to log Insights events, be sure the event selector enables  logging  of
       the  Insights  event types you want configured for your trail. For more
       information about logging Insights events, see Logging Insights  events
       for  trails  in  the CloudTrail User Guide . By default, trails created
       without specific event selectors are configured to  log  all  read  and
       write management events, and no data events.

       When  an  event  occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event
       selectors or advanced event selectors in all trails. For each trail, if
       the  event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the
       event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail doesn't
       log the event.

       Example

       o You  create  an  event selector for a trail and specify that you want
         write-only events.

       o The EC2 GetConsoleOutput and RunInstances  API  operations  occur  in
         your account.

       o CloudTrail evaluates whether the events match your event selectors.

       o The  RunInstances is a write-only event and it matches your event se-
         lector. The trail logs the event.

       o The GetConsoleOutput is a read-only event  that  doesn't  match  your
         event selector. The trail doesn't log the event.

       The PutEventSelectors operation must be called from the Region in which
       the trail was created; otherwise, an InvalidHomeRegionException  excep-
       tion is thrown.

       You  can  configure up to five event selectors for each trail. For more
       information, see Logging management events , Logging data events ,  and
       Quotas in CloudTrail in the CloudTrail User Guide .

       You  can add advanced event selectors, and conditions for your advanced
       event selectors, up to a maximum of 500 values for all  conditions  and
       selectors  on  a  trail.  You  can use either AdvancedEventSelectors or
       EventSelectors , but not both. If you apply AdvancedEventSelectors to a
       trail,  any  existing EventSelectors are overwritten. For more informa-
       tion about advanced event selectors, see Logging  data  events  in  the
       CloudTrail User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --trail-name (string)
          Specifies the name of the trail or trail ARN. If you specify a trail
          name, the string must meet the following requirements:

          o Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.),
            underscores (_), or dashes (-)

          o Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number

          o Be between 3 and 128 characters

          o Have  no  adjacent  periods,  underscores  or  dashes.  Names like
            my-_namespace and my--namespace are not valid.

          o Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)

          If you specify a trail ARN, it must be in the following format.
              arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail

       --event-selectors (list)
          Specifies the settings for your event selectors. You  can  configure
          up  to five event selectors for a trail. You can use either EventSe-
          lectors or AdvancedEventSelectors in  a  PutEventSelectors  request,
          but  not  both. If you apply EventSelectors to a trail, any existing
          AdvancedEventSelectors are overwritten.

          (structure)
              Use event selectors to further specify the management  and  data
              event  settings for your trail. By default, trails created with-
              out specific event selectors will be configured to log all  read
              and  write  management events, and no data events. When an event
              occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event  selector
              for  all  trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event
              selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If  the  event
              doesn't  match  any  event  selector,  the trail doesn't log the
              event.

              You can configure up to five event selectors for a trail.

              You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event  selec-
              tors to a trail.

              ReadWriteType -> (string)
                 Specify  if  you  want  your  trail  to log read-only events,
                 write-only events, or all. For example, the  EC2  GetConsole-
                 Output  is  a  read-only  API operation and RunInstances is a
                 write-only API operation.

                 By default, the value is All .

              IncludeManagementEvents -> (boolean)
                 Specify if you want your event selector to include management
                 events for your trail.

                 For more information, see Management Events in the CloudTrail
                 User Guide .

                 By default, the value is true .

                 The first copy of management events is free. You are  charged
                 for  additional copies of management events that you are log-
                 ging on any subsequent trail in the same Region. For more in-
                 formation about CloudTrail pricing, see CloudTrail Pricing .

              DataResources -> (list)
                 CloudTrail supports data event logging for Amazon S3 objects,
                 Lambda functions, and Amazon DynamoDB tables with basic event
                 selectors.  You  can specify up to 250 resources for an indi-
                 vidual event selector, but the total number of data resources
                 cannot exceed 250 across all event selectors in a trail. This
                 limit does not apply if you configure  resource  logging  for
                 all data events.

                 For  more  information,  see Data Events and Limits in Cloud-
                 Trail in the CloudTrail User Guide .

                 (structure)
                     The Amazon S3 buckets, Lambda functions,  or  Amazon  Dy-
                     namoDB  tables  that  you specify in your event selectors
                     for your trail to log data events.  Data  events  provide
                     information about the resource operations performed on or
                     within a resource itself. These are also  known  as  data
                     plane  operations.  You  can  specify  up to 250 data re-
                     sources for a trail.

                     NOTE:
                        The total number of allowed  data  resources  is  250.
                        This  number  can be distributed between 1 and 5 event
                        selectors, but the total cannot exceed 250 across  all
                        selectors for the trail.

                        If you are using advanced event selectors, the maximum
                        total number of values for all conditions, across  all
                        advanced event selectors for the trail, is 500.

                     The following example demonstrates how logging works when
                     you configure logging of all data events for an S3 bucket
                     named  bucket-1  .  In  this example, the CloudTrail user
                     specified an empty prefix, and the  option  to  log  both
                     Read and Write data events.

                     o A user uploads an image file to bucket-1 .

                     o The  PutObject  API  operation  is  an  Amazon  S3  ob-
                       ject-level API. It is  recorded  as  a  data  event  in
                       CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified an S3
                       bucket with an empty prefix, events that occur  on  any
                       object  in  that bucket are logged. The trail processes
                       and logs the event.

                     o A user uploads an object to an Amazon S3  bucket  named
                       arn:aws:s3:::bucket-2 .

                     o The  PutObject  API operation occurred for an object in
                       an S3 bucket that the CloudTrail  user  didn't  specify
                       for the trail. The trail doesnt log the event.

                     The following example demonstrates how logging works when
                     you configure logging of Lambda data events for a  Lambda
                     function  named MyLambdaFunction , but not for all Lambda
                     functions.

                     o A user runs a script that includes a call  to  the  My-
                       LambdaFunction  function  and the MyOtherLambdaFunction
                       function.

                     o The Invoke API  operation  on  MyLambdaFunction  is  an
                       Lambda  API.  It  is recorded as a data event in Cloud-
                       Trail. Because the CloudTrail  user  specified  logging
                       data  events  for MyLambdaFunction , any invocations of
                       that function are logged. The trail processes and  logs
                       the event.

                     o The Invoke API operation on MyOtherLambdaFunction is an
                       Lambda API. Because the CloudTrail user did not specify
                       logging  data  events for all Lambda functions, the In-
                       voke operation for MyOtherLambdaFunction does not match
                       the  function specified for the trail. The trail doesnt
                       log the event.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The resource type  in  which  you  want  to  log  data
                        events.  You can specify the following basic event se-
                        lector resource types:

                        o AWS::DynamoDB::Table

                        o AWS::Lambda::Function

                        o AWS::S3::Object

                        The  following  resource  types  are  also   available
                        through advanced event selectors. Basic event selector
                        resource types are valid in advanced event  selectors,
                        but  advanced  event  selector  resource types are not
                        valid in basic event selectors. For more  information,
                        see AdvancedFieldSelector .

                        o AWS::S3Outposts::Object

                        o AWS::SSMMessages::ControlChannel

                        o AWS::Timestream::Database

                        o AWS::Timestream::Table

                        o AWS::VerifiedPermissions::PolicyStore

                     Values -> (list)
                        An array of Amazon Resource Name (ARN) strings or par-
                        tial ARN strings for the specified objects.

                        o To log data events for all objects in all S3 buckets
                          in  your  Amazon  Web  Services account, specify the
                          prefix as arn:aws:s3 .

                        NOTE:
                            This also enables logging of data  event  activity
                            performed  by  any user or role in your Amazon Web
                            Services account, even if that  activity  is  per-
                            formed  on a bucket that belongs to another Amazon
                            Web Services account.

                        o To log data events for all objects in an S3  bucket,
                          specify  the  bucket and an empty object prefix such
                          as arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/  .  The  trail  logs  data
                          events for all objects in this S3 bucket.

                        o To log data events for specific objects, specify the
                          S3   bucket    and    object    prefix    such    as
                          arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/example-images   .  The  trail
                          logs data events for objects in this S3 bucket  that
                          match the prefix.

                        o To  log data events for all Lambda functions in your
                          Amazon Web Services account, specify the  prefix  as
                          arn:aws:lambda .

                        NOTE:
                            This  also enables logging of Invoke activity per-
                            formed by any user or role in your Amazon Web Ser-
                            vices  account, even if that activity is performed
                            on a function that belongs to another  Amazon  Web
                            Services account.

                        o To  log  data events for a specific Lambda function,
                          specify the function ARN.

                        NOTE:
                            Lambda function ARNs are exact.  For  example,  if
                            you       specify       a       function       ARN
                            arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:func-
                            tion:helloworld  , data events will only be logged
                            for    arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:func-
                            tion:helloworld  .  They  will  not  be logged for
                            arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:func-
                            tion:helloworld2 .

                        o To  log  data events for all DynamoDB tables in your
                          Amazon Web Services account, specify the  prefix  as
                          arn:aws:dynamodb .

                        (string)

              ExcludeManagementEventSources -> (list)
                 An  optional  list of service event sources from which you do
                 not want management events to be logged  on  your  trail.  In
                 this release, the list can be empty (disables the filter), or
                 it can filter out Key Management Service or Amazon  RDS  Data
                 API events by containing kms.amazonaws.com or rdsdata.amazon-
                 aws.com . By default, ExcludeManagementEventSources is empty,
                 and  KMS  and  Amazon  RDS Data API events are logged to your
                 trail. You can exclude management event sources only  in  Re-
                 gions that support the event source.

       --advanced-event-selectors (list)
          Specifies the settings for advanced event selectors. You can add ad-
          vanced event selectors, and conditions for your advanced  event  se-
          lectors, up to a maximum of 500 values for all conditions and selec-
          tors on a  trail.  You  can  use  either  AdvancedEventSelectors  or
          EventSelectors  ,  but not both. If you apply AdvancedEventSelectors
          to a trail, any existing EventSelectors are  overwritten.  For  more
          information  about advanced event selectors, see Logging data events
          in the CloudTrail User Guide .

          (structure)
              Advanced event selectors let you create  fine-grained  selectors
              for  the  following  CloudTrail event record elds. They help you
              control costs by logging only those events that are important to
              you.  For  more  information about advanced event selectors, see
              Logging data events in the CloudTrail User Guide .

              Name -> (string)
                 An optional, descriptive name for an advanced event selector,
                 such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets".

              FieldSelectors -> (list)
                 Contains all selector statements in an advanced event  selec-
                 tor.

                 (structure)
                     A  single  selector statement in an advanced event selec-
                     tor.

                     Field -> (string)
                        A field in a CloudTrail event record on which to  fil-
                        ter  events  to  be  logged. For event data stores for
                        Config configuration items, Audit Manager evidence, or
                        non-Amazon Web Services events, the field is used only
                        for selecting events as filtering is not supported.

                        For CloudTrail event records, supported fields include
                        readOnly , eventCategory , eventSource (for management
                        events),  eventName  ,  resources.type   ,   and   re-

                        For  event data stores for Config configuration items,
                        Audit Manager evidence,  or  non-Amazon  Web  Services
                        events, the only supported field is eventCategory .

                          CloudTrail  logs both read and write events. A value
                          of true logs only read events. A value of false logs
                          only write events.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To configure event selectors for a trail

       To  create  an event selector, run the ''put-event-selectors'' command.
       When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the configu-
       ration  for  your trails. If the event matches any event selector for a
       trail, the trail processes and logs the event.  You can configure up to
       5 event selectors for a trail and up to 250 data resources for a trail.

       The  following  example  creates  an  event  selector for a trail named
       ''TrailName'' to include read-only and  write-only  management  events,
       data  events  for  two  Amazon  S3 bucket/prefix combinations, and data
       events    for    a     single     AWS     Lambda     function     named
       ''hello-world-python-function'':

          aws cloudtrail put-event-selectors --trail-name TrailName --event-selectors '[{"ReadWriteType": "All","IncludeManagementEvents": true,"DataResources": [{"Type":"AWS::S3::Object", "Values": ["arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/prefix","arn:aws:s3:::mybucket2/prefix2"]},{"Type": "AWS::Lambda::Function","Values": ["arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:999999999999:function:hello-world-python-function"]}]}]'

       Output:

          {
            "EventSelectors": [
                {
                    "IncludeManagementEvents": true,

            "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/TrailName"
          }

       The  following  example  creates  an  event  selector for a trail named
       ''TrailName2''  that  includes  all  events,  including  read-only  and
       write-only  management  events,  and  all data events for all Amazon S3
       buckets and AWS Lambda functions in the AWS account:

       Output:

          {
            "EventSelectors": [
                {
                    "IncludeManagementEvents": true,

          (structure)
              Use  event  selectors to further specify the management and data
              event settings for your trail. By default, trails created  with-
              out  specific event selectors will be configured to log all read
              and write management events, and no data events. When  an  event
              occurs  in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selector
              for all trails. For each trail, if the event matches  any  event
              selector,  the  trail processes and logs the event. If the event
              doesn't match any event selector,  the  trail  doesn't  log  the
              event.

              You can configure up to five event selectors for a trail.

              You  cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selec-
              tors to a trail.

              ReadWriteType -> (string)
                 Specify if you want  your  trail  to  log  read-only  events,
                 write-only  events,  or all. For example, the EC2 GetConsole-
                 Output is a read-only API operation  and  RunInstances  is  a
                 write-only API operation.

                 By default, the value is All .

              IncludeManagementEvents -> (boolean)
                 Specify if you want your event selector to include management
                 events for your trail.

                 For more information, see Management Events in the CloudTrail
                 User Guide .

                 By default, the value is true .

                 The  first copy of management events is free. You are charged
                 for additional copies of management events that you are  log-
                 ging on any subsequent trail in the same Region. For more in-
                 formation about CloudTrail pricing, see CloudTrail Pricing .

              DataResources -> (list)
                 CloudTrail supports data event logging for Amazon S3 objects,
                 Lambda functions, and Amazon DynamoDB tables with basic event
                 selectors. You can specify up to 250 resources for  an  indi-
                 vidual event selector, but the total number of data resources
                 cannot exceed 250 across all event selectors in a trail. This
                 limit  does  not  apply if you configure resource logging for
                 all data events.

                 For more information, see Data Events and  Limits  in  Cloud-
                 Trail in the CloudTrail User Guide .

                 (structure)
                     The  Amazon  S3  buckets, Lambda functions, or Amazon Dy-
                     namoDB tables that you specify in  your  event  selectors
                     for  your  trail  to log data events. Data events provide
                     information about the resource operations performed on or
                     within  a  resource  itself. These are also known as data
                     plane operations. You can specify  up  to  250  data  re-
                     sources for a trail.

                     NOTE:
                        The  total  number  of  allowed data resources is 250.
                        This number can be distributed between 1 and  5  event
                        selectors,  but the total cannot exceed 250 across all
                        selectors for the trail.

                        If you are using advanced event selectors, the maximum
                        total  number of values for all conditions, across all
                        advanced event selectors for the trail, is 500.

                     The following example demonstrates how logging works when
                     you configure logging of all data events for an S3 bucket
                     named bucket-1 . In this  example,  the  CloudTrail  user
                     specified  an  empty  prefix,  and the option to log both
                     Read and Write data events.

                     o A user uploads an image file to bucket-1 .

                     o The  PutObject  API  operation  is  an  Amazon  S3  ob-
                       ject-level  API.  It  is  recorded  as  a data event in
                       CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified an S3
                       bucket  with  an empty prefix, events that occur on any
                       object in that bucket are logged. The  trail  processes
                       and logs the event.

                     o A  user  uploads an object to an Amazon S3 bucket named
                       arn:aws:s3:::bucket-2 .

                     o The PutObject API operation occurred for an  object  in
                       an  S3  bucket  that the CloudTrail user didn't specify
                       for the trail. The trail doesnt log the event.

                     The following example demonstrates how logging works when
                     you  configure logging of Lambda data events for a Lambda
                     function named MyLambdaFunction , but not for all  Lambda
                     functions.

                     o A  user  runs  a script that includes a call to the My-
                       LambdaFunction function and  the  MyOtherLambdaFunction
                       function.

                     o The  Invoke  API  operation  on  MyLambdaFunction is an
                       Lambda API. It is recorded as a data  event  in  Cloud-
                       Trail.  Because  the  CloudTrail user specified logging
                       data events for MyLambdaFunction , any  invocations  of
                       that  function are logged. The trail processes and logs
                       the event.

                     o The Invoke API operation on MyOtherLambdaFunction is an
                       Lambda API. Because the CloudTrail user did not specify
                       logging data events for all Lambda functions,  the  In-
                       voke operation for MyOtherLambdaFunction does not match
                       the function specified for the trail. The trail  doesnt
                       log the event.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The  resource  type  in  which  you  want  to log data
                        events. You can specify the following basic event  se-
                        lector resource types:

                        o AWS::DynamoDB::Table

                        o AWS::Lambda::Function

                        o AWS::S3::Object

                        The   following  resource  types  are  also  available
                        through advanced event selectors. Basic event selector
                        resource  types are valid in advanced event selectors,
                        but advanced event selector  resource  types  are  not
                        valid  in basic event selectors. For more information,
                        see AdvancedFieldSelector .

                        o AWS::Timestream::Table

                        o AWS::VerifiedPermissions::PolicyStore

                     Values -> (list)
                        An array of Amazon Resource Name (ARN) strings or par-
                        tial ARN strings for the specified objects.

                        o To log data events for all objects in all S3 buckets
                          in your Amazon Web  Services  account,  specify  the
                          prefix as arn:aws:s3 .

                        NOTE:
                            This  also  enables logging of data event activity
                            performed by any user or role in your  Amazon  Web
                            Services  account,  even  if that activity is per-
                            formed on a bucket that belongs to another  Amazon
                            Web Services account.

                        o To  log data events for all objects in an S3 bucket,
                          specify the bucket and an empty object  prefix  such
                          as  arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/  .  The  trail  logs data
                          events for all objects in this S3 bucket.

                        o To log data events for specific objects, specify the
                          S3    bucket    and    object    prefix    such   as
                          arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/example-images  .  The   trail
                          logs  data events for objects in this S3 bucket that
                          match the prefix.

                        o To log data events for all Lambda functions in  your
                          Amazon  Web  Services account, specify the prefix as
                          arn:aws:lambda .

                        NOTE:
                            This also enables logging of Invoke activity  per-
                            formed by any user or role in your Amazon Web Ser-
                            vices account, even if that activity is  performed
                            on  a  function that belongs to another Amazon Web
                            Services account.

                        o To log data events for a specific  Lambda  function,
                          specify the function ARN.

                        NOTE:
                            Lambda  function  ARNs  are exact. For example, if
                            you       specify       a       function       ARN
                            arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:func-
                            tion:helloworld , data events will only be  logged
                            for    arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:func-
                            tion:helloworld . They  will  not  be  logged  for
                            arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:func-
                            tion:helloworld2 .

                        o To log data events for all DynamoDB tables  in  your
                          Amazon  Web  Services account, specify the prefix as
                          arn:aws:dynamodb .

                        (string)

              ExcludeManagementEventSources -> (list)
                 An optional list of service event sources from which  you  do
                 not  want  management  events  to be logged on your trail. In
                 this release, the list can be empty (disables the filter), or
                 it  can  filter out Key Management Service or Amazon RDS Data
                 API events by containing kms.amazonaws.com or rdsdata.amazon-
                 aws.com . By default, ExcludeManagementEventSources is empty,
                 and KMS and Amazon RDS Data API events  are  logged  to  your
                 trail.  You  can exclude management event sources only in Re-
                 gions that support the event source.

                 (string)

       AdvancedEventSelectors -> (list)
          Specifies the advanced event selectors configured for your trail.

          (structure)
              Advanced event selectors let you create  fine-grained  selectors
              for  the  following  CloudTrail event record elds. They help you
              control costs by logging only those events that are important to
              you.  For  more  information about advanced event selectors, see
              Logging data events in the CloudTrail User Guide .

              o readOnly

              o eventSource

              o eventName

              o eventCategory

              o resources.type

              o resources.ARN

              You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event  selec-
              tors to a trail.

              Name -> (string)
                 An optional, descriptive name for an advanced event selector,
                 such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets".

              FieldSelectors -> (list)
                 Contains all selector statements in an advanced event  selec-
                 tor.

                 (structure)
                     A  single  selector statement in an advanced event selec-
                     tor.

                     Field -> (string)
                        A field in a CloudTrail event record on which to  fil-
                        ter  events  to  be  logged. For event data stores for
                        Config configuration items, Audit Manager evidence, or
                        non-Amazon Web Services events, the field is used only
                        for selecting events as filtering is not supported.

                        For CloudTrail event records, supported fields include
                        readOnly , eventCategory , eventSource (for management
                        events),  eventName  ,  resources.type   ,   and   re-
                        sources.ARN .

                        For  event data stores for Config configuration items,
                        Audit Manager evidence,  or  non-Amazon  Web  Services
                        events, the only supported field is eventCategory .

                        o

                          **
                          readOnly ** - Optional. Can be set to Equals a value
                          of true or false . If you do  not  add  this  field,
                          CloudTrail  logs both read and write events. A value
                          of true logs only read events. A value of false logs
                          only write events.
