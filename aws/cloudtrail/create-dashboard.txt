CREATE-DASHBOARD()                                          CREATE-DASHBOARD()



NAME
       create-dashboard -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a custom dashboard or the Highlights dashboard.

       o Custom  dashboards  -  Custom dashboards allow you to query events in
         any event data store type. You can add up to 10 widgets to  a  custom
         dashboard.  You  can  manually refresh a custom dashboard, or you can
         set a refresh schedule.

       o Highlights dashboard - You can create the Highlights dashboard to see
         a  summary of key user activities and API usage across all your event
         data stores. CloudTrail Lake manages the Highlights dashboard and re-
         freshes  the  dashboard every 6 hours. To create the Highlights dash-
         board, you must set and enable a refresh schedule.

       CloudTrail runs queries to populate the dashboard's  widgets  during  a
       manual  or scheduled refresh. CloudTrail must be granted permissions to
       run the StartQuery operation on your behalf.  To  provide  permissions,
       run  the  PutResourcePolicy operation to attach a resource-based policy
       to each event data store. For  more  information,  see  Example:  Allow
       CloudTrail  to  run  queries  to populate a dashboard in the CloudTrail
       User Guide .

       To set a refresh schedule, CloudTrail must be  granted  permissions  to
       run  the  StartDashboardRefresh  operation  to refresh the dashboard on
       your behalf. To provide permissions, run the  PutResourcePolicy  opera-
       tion  to  attach a resource-based policy to the dashboard. For more in-
       formation, see Resource-based policy example for  a  dashboard  in  the
       CloudTrail User Guide .

       For  more  information about dashboards, see CloudTrail Lake dashboards
       in the CloudTrail User Guide .
