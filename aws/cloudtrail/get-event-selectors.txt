GET-EVENT-SELECTORS()                                    GET-EVENT-SELECTORS()



NAME
       get-event-selectors -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the settings for the event selectors that you configured for
       your trail. The information returned for your event selectors  includes
       the following:

       o If  your event selector includes read-only events, write-only events,
         or all events. This applies to management events,  data  events,  and
         network activity events.

       o If your event selector includes management events.

       o If  your  event  selector includes network activity events, the event
         sources for which you are logging network activity events.

       o If your event selector includes data events, the resources  on  which
         you are logging data events.

       For more information about logging management, data, and network activ-
       ity events, see the following topics in the CloudTrail User Guide :

       o Logging management events

       o Logging data events

       o Logging network activity events

OPTIONS
       --trail-name (string)
          Specifies the name of the trail or trail ARN. If you specify a trail
          name, the string must meet the following requirements:

          o Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.),
            underscores (_), or dashes (-)

          o Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number

          o Be between 3 and 128 characters

          o Have no  adjacent  periods,  underscores  or  dashes.  Names  like
            my-_namespace and my--namespace are not valid.

          o Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)

          If you specify a trail ARN, it must be in the format:
              arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view the event selector settings for a trail

       The following get-event-selectors  command  returns  the  settings  for
       Trail1:

          aws cloudtrail get-event-selectors --trail-name Trail1

       Output:

          {
            "EventSelectors": [
                {
                    "IncludeManagementEvents": true,
                    "DataResources": [],
                    "ReadWriteType": "All"
                }
            ],
            "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-1:123456789012:trail/Trail1"
          }

OUTPUT
       TrailARN -> (string)
          The specified trail ARN that has the event selectors.

       EventSelectors -> (list)
          The event selectors that are configured for the trail.

          (structure)
              Use  event  selectors to further specify the management and data
              event settings for your trail. By default, trails created  with-
              out  specific event selectors will be configured to log all read
              and write management events, and no data events. When  an  event
              occurs  in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selector
              for all trails. For each trail, if the event matches  any  event
              selector,  the  trail processes and logs the event. If the event
              doesn't match any event selector,  the  trail  doesn't  log  the
              event.

              You can configure up to five event selectors for a trail.

              You  cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selec-
              tors to a trail.

              ReadWriteType -> (string)
                 Specify if you want  your  trail  to  log  read-only  events,
                 write-only  events,  or all. For example, the EC2 GetConsole-
                 Output is a read-only API operation  and  RunInstances  is  a
                 write-only API operation.

                 By default, the value is All .

              IncludeManagementEvents -> (boolean)
                 Specify if you want your event selector to include management
                 events for your trail.

                 For more information, see Management Events in the CloudTrail
                 User Guide .

                 By default, the value is true .

                 The  first copy of management events is free. You are charged
                 for additional copies of management events that you are  log-
                 ging on any subsequent trail in the same Region. For more in-
                 formation about CloudTrail pricing, see CloudTrail Pricing .

              DataResources -> (list)
                 CloudTrail supports data event logging for Amazon S3  objects
                 in standard S3 buckets, Lambda functions, and Amazon DynamoDB
                 tables with basic event selectors. You can specify up to  250
                 resources  for  an  individual  event selector, but the total
                 number of data resources cannot exceed 250 across  all  event
                 selectors  in  a trail. This limit does not apply if you con-
                 figure resource logging for all data events.

                 For more information, see Data Events and  Limits  in  Cloud-
                 Trail in the CloudTrail User Guide .

                 NOTE:
                     To log data events for all other resource types including
                     objects stored  in  directory  buckets  ,  you  must  use
                     AdvancedEventSelectors  .  You  must  also use AdvancedE-
                     ventSelectors if you want  to  filter  on  the  eventName
                     field.

                 (structure)
                     You can configure the DataResource in an EventSelector to
                     log data events for the following three resource types:

                     o AWS::DynamoDB::Table

                     o AWS::Lambda::Function

                     o AWS::S3::Object

                     To log data events for all other resource types including
                     objects  stored  in  directory  buckets  ,  you  must use
                     AdvancedEventSelectors . You  must  also  use  AdvancedE-
                     ventSelectors  if  you  want  to  filter on the eventName
                     field.

                     Configure the DataResource to specify the  resource  type
                     and resource ARNs for which you want to log data events.

                     NOTE:
                        The  total  number  of  allowed data resources is 250.
                        This number can be distributed between 1 and  5  event
                        selectors,  but the total cannot exceed 250 across all
                        selectors for the trail.

                     The following example demonstrates how logging works when
                     you  configure  logging  of all data events for a general
                     purpose bucket named amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 . In this exam-
                     ple,  the  CloudTrail user specified an empty prefix, and
                     the option to log both Read and Write data events.

                     o A user uploads an image file to amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 .

                     o The  PutObject  API  operation  is  an  Amazon  S3  ob-
                       ject-level  API.  It  is  recorded  as  a data event in
                       CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified an S3
                       bucket  with  an empty prefix, events that occur on any
                       object in that bucket are logged. The  trail  processes
                       and logs the event.

                     o A  user  uploads an object to an Amazon S3 bucket named
                       arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 .

                     o The PutObject API operation occurred for an  object  in
                       an  S3  bucket  that the CloudTrail user didn't specify
                       for the trail. The trail doesnt log the event.

                     The following example demonstrates how logging works when
                     you  configure logging of Lambda data events for a Lambda
                     function named MyLambdaFunction , but not for all  Lambda
                     functions.

                     o A  user  runs  a script that includes a call to the My-
                       LambdaFunction function and  the  MyOtherLambdaFunction
                       function.

                     o The  Invoke  API  operation  on  MyLambdaFunction is an
                       Lambda API. It is recorded as a data  event  in  Cloud-
                       Trail.  Because  the  CloudTrail user specified logging
                       data events for MyLambdaFunction , any  invocations  of
                       that  function are logged. The trail processes and logs
                       the event.

                     o The Invoke API operation on MyOtherLambdaFunction is an
                       Lambda API. Because the CloudTrail user did not specify
                       logging data events for all Lambda functions,  the  In-
                       voke operation for MyOtherLambdaFunction does not match
                       the function specified for the trail. The trail  doesnt
                       log the event.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The  resource  type  in  which  you  want  to log data
                        events. You can specify the following basic event  se-
                        lector resource types:

                        o AWS::DynamoDB::Table

                        o AWS::Lambda::Function

                        o AWS::S3::Object

                        Additional  resource  types  are available through ad-
                        vanced event  selectors.  For  more  information,  see
                        AdvancedEventSelector .

                     Values -> (list)
                        An array of Amazon Resource Name (ARN) strings or par-
                        tial ARN strings for the specified resource type.

                        o To log data events for all objects in all S3 buckets
                          in  your  Amazon  Web  Services account, specify the
                          prefix as arn:aws:s3 .

                        NOTE:
                            This also enables logging of data  event  activity
                            performed  by  any user or role in your Amazon Web
                            Services account, even if that  activity  is  per-
                            formed  on a bucket that belongs to another Amazon
                            Web Services account.

                        o To log data events for all objects in an S3  bucket,
                          specify  the  bucket and an empty object prefix such
                          as arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1/  .  The  trail
                          logs data events for all objects in this S3 bucket.

                        o To log data events for specific objects, specify the
                          S3   bucket    and    object    prefix    such    as
                          arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1/example-images   .
                          The trail logs data events for objects  in  this  S3
                          bucket that match the prefix.

                        o To  log data events for all Lambda functions in your
                          Amazon Web Services account, specify the  prefix  as
                          arn:aws:lambda .

                        NOTE:
                            This  also enables logging of Invoke activity per-
                            formed by any user or role in your Amazon Web Ser-
                            vices  account, even if that activity is performed
                            on a function that belongs to another  Amazon  Web
                            Services account.

                        o To  log  data events for a specific Lambda function,
                          specify the function ARN.

                        NOTE:
                            Lambda function ARNs are exact.  For  example,  if
                            you       specify       a       function       ARN
                            arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:func-
                            tion:helloworld  , data events will only be logged
                            for    arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:func-
                            tion:helloworld  .  They  will  not  be logged for
                            arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:func-
                            tion:helloworld2 .

                        o To  log  data events for all DynamoDB tables in your
                          Amazon Web Services account, specify the  prefix  as
                          arn:aws:dynamodb .

                        (string)

              ExcludeManagementEventSources -> (list)
                 An  optional  list of service event sources from which you do
                 not want management events to be logged  on  your  trail.  In
                 this release, the list can be empty (disables the filter), or
                 it can filter out Key Management Service or Amazon  RDS  Data
                 API events by containing kms.amazonaws.com or rdsdata.amazon-
                 aws.com . By default, ExcludeManagementEventSources is empty,
                 and  KMS  and  Amazon  RDS Data API events are logged to your
                 trail. You can exclude management event sources only  in  Re-
                 gions that support the event source.

                 (string)

       AdvancedEventSelectors -> (list)
          The advanced event selectors that are configured for the trail.

              Advanced  event  selectors let you create fine-grained selectors
              for CloudTrail management, data, and  network  activity  events.
              They  help  you  control costs by logging only those events that
              are important to you. For more information about configuring ad-
              vanced  event  selectors,  see the Logging data events , Logging
              network activity events , and Logging management  events  topics
              in the CloudTrail User Guide .

              You  cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selec-
              tors to a trail.

                          used  for  management  events  and data events. This
                          field can be set to Equals with a value of  true  or
                          false  .  If  you  do not add this field, CloudTrail
                          logs both read and write events.  A  value  of  true
                          logs  only  read  events. A value of false logs only
                          write events.
