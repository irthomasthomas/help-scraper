UPDATE-EVENT-DATA-STORE()                            UPDATE-EVENT-DATA-STORE()



NAME
       update-event-data-store -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  an  event  data store. The required EventDataStore value is an
       ARN or the ID portion of the ARN. Other parameters are optional, but at
       least one optional parameter must be specified, or CloudTrail throws an
       error. RetentionPeriod is in days, and valid values  are  integers  be-
       tween  7  and  3653  if  the  BillingMode  is  set to EXTENDABLE_RETEN-
       TION_PRICING , or between 7 and 2557 if BillingMode is set to FIXED_RE-
       TENTION_PRICING . By default, TerminationProtection is enabled.

       For event data stores for CloudTrail events, AdvancedEventSelectors in-
       cludes or excludes management, data, or network activity events in your
       event  data  store. For more information about AdvancedEventSelectors ,
       see AdvancedEventSelectors .

       For event data stores for CloudTrail Insights events, Config configura-
       tion  items, Audit Manager evidence, or non-Amazon Web Services events,
       AdvancedEventSelectors includes events of that type in your event  data
       store.

OPTIONS
       --event-data-store (string)
          The  ARN  (or the ID suffix of the ARN) of the event data store that
          you want to update.

       --name (string)
          The event data store name.

       --advanced-event-selectors (list)
          The advanced event selectors used to select  events  for  the  event
          data  store.  You  can configure up to five advanced event selectors
          for each event data store.

          (structure)
              Advanced event selectors let you create  fine-grained  selectors
              for  CloudTrail  management,  data, and network activity events.
              They help you control costs by logging only  those  events  that
              are important to you. For more information about configuring ad-
              vanced event selectors, see the Logging data  events  ,  Logging
              network  activity  events , and Logging management events topics
              in the CloudTrail User Guide .

              You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event  selec-
              tors to a trail.

                          only),  and  network activity events. For management
                          events for trails, this is an  optional  field  that
                          can  be  set  to NotEquals  kms.amazonaws.com to ex-
                          clude KMS  management  events,  or  NotEquals   rds-
                          data.amazonaws.com to exclude RDS management events.

                          stores,  you  can  use  it to include or exclude any
                          event source and can use any operator.  For  network
                          activity  events, this is a required field that only
                          uses the Equals operator.  Set  this  field  to  the
                          event  source  for which you want to log network ac-
                          tivity events. If you want to log  network  activity
                          events for multiple event sources, you must create a
                          separate field selector for each event  source.  The
                          following  are  valid  values  for  network activity
                          events:

       --multi-region-enabled | --no-multi-region-enabled (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  an event data store collects events from all Re-
          gions, or only from the Region in which it was created.

       --organization-enabled | --no-organization-enabled (boolean)
          Specifies whether an event data store collects events logged for  an
          organization in Organizations.

          NOTE:
              Only  the management account for the organization can convert an
              organization event data store to a non-organization  event  data
              store,  or convert a non-organization event data store to an or-
              ganization event data store.

       --retention-period (integer)
          The retention period of the event data store, in days.  If  Billing-
          Mode  is  set to EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING , you can set a reten-
          tion period of up to 3653 days,  the  equivalent  of  10  years.  If
          BillingMode is set to FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING , you can set a reten-
          tion period of up to 2557 days, the equivalent of seven years.

          CloudTrail Lake determines whether to retain an event by checking if
          the eventTime of the event is within the specified retention period.
          For example, if you set a retention period of  90  days,  CloudTrail
          will remove events when the eventTime is older than 90 days.

          NOTE:
              If  you  decrease  the  retention period of an event data store,
              CloudTrail will remove any events with an eventTime  older  than
              the new retention period. For example, if the previous retention
              period was 365 days and you decrease it to 100 days,  CloudTrail
              will remove events with an eventTime older than 100 days.

       --termination-protection-enabled  | --no-termination-protection-enabled
       (boolean)
          Indicates that termination protection is enabled and the event  data
          store cannot be automatically deleted.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          Specifies  the  KMS key ID to use to encrypt the events delivered by
          CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by  alias/  ,  a
          fully  specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or
          a globally unique identifier.

          WARNING:
              Disabling or deleting the KMS key, or removing  CloudTrail  per-
              missions  on the key, prevents CloudTrail from logging events to
              the event data store, and prevents users from querying the  data
              in  the  event data store that was encrypted with the key. After
              you associate an event data store with a KMS key,  the  KMS  key
              cannot be removed or changed. Before you disable or delete a KMS
              key that you are using with an event data store, delete or  back
              up your event data store.

          CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information
          about multi-Region keys, see Using multi-Region keys in the Key Man-
          agement Service Developer Guide .

          Examples:

          o alias/MyAliasName

          o arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName

          o arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

          o 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

       --billing-mode (string)

          NOTE:
              You  can't  change  the  billing  mode  from   EXTENDABLE_RETEN-
              TION_PRICING  to FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING . If BillingMode is set
              to EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING and you want to use FIXED_RETEN-
              TION_PRICING instead, you'll need to stop ingestion on the event
              data store and create a new event data store that uses FIXED_RE-
              TENTION_PRICING .

          The  billing  mode  for the event data store determines the cost for
          ingesting events and the default and maximum  retention  period  for
          the event data store.

          The following are the possible values:

          o EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING - This billing mode is generally rec-
            ommended if you want a flexible retention period  of  up  to  3653
            days  (about  10  years).  The  default  retention period for this
            billing mode is 366 days.

          o FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING - This billing mode is recommended if  you
            expect  to ingest more than 25 TB of event data per month and need
            a retention period of up to 2557 days (about 7 years). The default
            retention period for this billing mode is 2557 days.

          For  more information about CloudTrail pricing, see CloudTrail Pric-
          ing and Managing CloudTrail Lake costs .

          Possible values:

          o EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING

          o FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

              for CloudTrail management, data, and  network  activity  events.
              They  help  you  control costs by logging only those events that
              are important to you. For more information about configuring ad-
              vanced  event  selectors,  see the Logging data events , Logging
              network activity events , and Logging management  events  topics
