GET-EXPENSE-ANALYSIS()                                  GET-EXPENSE-ANALYSIS()



NAME
       get-expense-analysis -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the results for an Amazon Textract asynchronous operation that an-
       alyzes invoices and receipts. Amazon Textract  finds  contact  informa-
       tion,  items  purchased,  and  vendor name, from input invoices and re-
       ceipts.

       You start asynchronous invoice/receipt analysis  by  calling   StartEx-
       penseAnalysis  ,  which returns a job identifier (JobId ). Upon comple-
       tion of the invoice/receipt analysis,  Amazon  Textract  publishes  the
       completion  status  to  the  Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon
       SNS) topic. This topic must be registered in the initial call to Start-
       ExpenseAnalysis  .  To  get the results of the invoice/receipt analysis
       operation, first ensure that the status value published to  the  Amazon
       SNS  topic is SUCCEEDED . If so, call GetExpenseAnalysis , and pass the
       job identifier (JobId ) from the initial call to StartExpenseAnalysis .

       Use the MaxResults parameter to limit the number of blocks that are re-
       turned.  If  there  are more results than specified in MaxResults , the
       value of NextToken in the operation response contains a pagination  to-
       ken  for  getting  the next set of results. To get the next page of re-
       sults, call GetExpenseAnalysis , and populate the NextToken request pa-
       rameter  with the token value that's returned from the previous call to
       GetExpenseAnalysis .

          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the text detection job.  The  JobId  is  re-
          turned from StartExpenseAnalysis . A JobId value is only valid for 7
          days.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to  return  per  paginated  call.  The
          largest  value you can specify is 20. If you specify a value greater
          than 20, a maximum of 20 results is returned. The default  value  is
          20.

       --next-token (string)
          If  the  previous  response  was  incomplete (because there are more
          blocks to retrieve), Amazon Textract returns a pagination  token  in
          the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next
          set of blocks.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
