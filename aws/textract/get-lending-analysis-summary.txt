GET-LENDING-ANALYSIS-SUMMARY()                  GET-LENDING-ANALYSIS-SUMMARY()



NAME
       get-lending-analysis-summary -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  summarized  results for the StartLendingAnalysis operation, which
       analyzes text in a lending document. The returned summary  consists  of
       information about documents grouped together by a common document type.
       Information like detected signatures, page numbers, and split documents
       is returned with respect to the type of grouped document.

       You  start asynchronous text analysis by calling StartLendingAnalysis ,
       which returns a job identifier (JobId ). When the text analysis  opera-
       tion  finishes,  Amazon  Textract  publishes a completion status to the
       Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that's registered
       in the initial call to StartLendingAnalysis .

       To get the results of the text analysis operation, first check that the
       status value published to the Amazon SNS topic  is  SUCCEEDED.  If  so,
       call  GetLendingAnalysisSummary  , and pass the job identifier (JobId )
       from the initial call to StartLendingAnalysis .

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the lending or text-detection job. The JobId
          is  returned  from StartLendingAnalysis. A JobId value is only valid
          for 7 days.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
