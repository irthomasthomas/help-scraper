START-DOCUMENT-ANALYSIS()                            START-DOCUMENT-ANALYSIS()



NAME
       start-document-analysis -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts the asynchronous analysis of an input document for relationships
       between detected items such as key-value pairs, tables,  and  selection
       elements.
          StartDocumentAnalysis  can  analyze  text  in  documents that are in
          JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and PDF format. The documents are stored in an Ama-
          zon  S3 bucket. Use  DocumentLocation to specify the bucket name and
          file name of the document.

          StartDocumentAnalysis returns a job identifier (JobId ) that you use
          to get the results of the operation. When text analysis is finished,
          Amazon Textract publishes a completion status to the  Amazon  Simple
          Notification  Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you specify in Notifi-
          cationChannel . To get the results of the text  analysis  operation,
          first  check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic
          is SUCCEEDED . If so, call  GetDocumentAnalysis , and pass  the  job
          identifier (JobId ) from the initial call to StartDocumentAnalysis .

       For more information, see Document Text Analysis .

OPTIONS
       --document-location (structure)
          The location of the document to be processed.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 bucket that contains the input document.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The  name  of the S3 bucket. Note that the # character is not
                 valid in the file name.

              Name -> (string)
                 The file name of the input document.  Synchronous  operations
                 can use image files that are in JPEG or PNG format. Asynchro-
                 nous operations also support PDF and TIFF format files.

              Version -> (string)
                 If the bucket has versioning enabled, you can specify the ob-
                 ject version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --feature-types (list)
          A  list  of the types of analysis to perform. Add TABLES to the list
          to return information about the tables that are detected in the  in-
          put  document.  Add  FORMS  to return detected form data. To perform
          both types of analysis, add TABLES and FORMS to FeatureTypes  .  All
          lines  and  words  detected  in the document are included in the re-
          sponse (including text that isn't related to the value  of  Feature-
          Types ).

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            TABLES
            FORMS
            QUERIES

       --client-request-token (string)
          The  idempotent token that you use to identify the start request. If
          you use the same token with multiple StartDocumentAnalysis requests,
          the  same  JobId  is returned. Use ClientRequestToken to prevent the
          same job from being accidentally started more than  once.  For  more
          information, see Calling Amazon Textract Asynchronous Operations .

       --job-tag (string)
          An identifier that you specify that's included in the completion no-
          tification published to the Amazon SNS topic. For example,  you  can
          use  JobTag to identify the type of document that the completion no-
          tification corresponds to (such as a tax form or a receipt).

       --notification-channel (structure)
          The Amazon SNS topic ARN that you want Amazon  Textract  to  publish
          the completion status of the operation to.

          SNSTopicArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  SNS topic that Amazon Textract posts the completion
              status to.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that gives  Amazon
              Textract publishing permissions to the Amazon SNS topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SNSTopicArn=string,RoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SNSTopicArn": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string"
          }

       --output-config (structure)
          Sets if the output will go to a customer defined bucket. By default,
          Amazon Textract will save the results internally to be  accessed  by
          the GetDocumentAnalysis operation.

          S3Bucket -> (string)
              The name of the bucket your output will go to.

          S3Prefix -> (string)
              The  prefix  of the object key that the output will be saved to.
              When not enabled, the prefix will be textract_output".

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Bucket=string,S3Prefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Bucket": "string",
            "S3Prefix": "string"
          }

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The KMS key used to encrypt the inference results. This  can  be  in
          either  Key  ID or Key Alias format. When a KMS key is provided, the
          KMS key will be used for server-side encryption of  the  objects  in
          the  customer bucket. When this parameter is not enabled, the result
          will be encrypted server side,using SSE-S3.

       --queries-config (structure)
          Queries -> (list)
              (structure)
                 Each query contains the question you want to ask in the  Text
                 and the alias you want to associate.

                 Text -> (string)
                     Question that Amazon Textract will apply to the document.
                     An example would be "What is the customer's SSN?"

                 Alias -> (string)
                     Alias attached to the query, for ease of location.

                 Pages -> (list)
                     List of pages associated with the query. The following is
                     a list of rules for using this parameter.

                     o If  a  page is not specified, it is set to ["1"] by de-
                       fault.

                     o The following characters are allowed in the parameter's
                       string:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 - * . No whitespace is al-
                       lowed.

                     o When using * to indicate all pages, it must be the only
                       element in the string.

                     o You  can  use page intervals, such as [1-3, 1-1, 4-*] .
                       Where * indicates last page of document.

                     o Specified pages must be greater than 0 and less than or
                       equal to the number of pages in the document.

                     (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Queries": [
              {
                "Text": "string",
                "Alias": "string",
                "Pages": ["string", ...]
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To start analyzing text in a multi-page document

       The  following start-document-analysis example shows how to start asyn-
       chronous analysis of text in a multi-page document.

       Linux/macOS:

          aws textract start-document-analysis \
              --document-location '{"S3Object":{"Bucket":"bucket","Name":"document"}}' \
              --feature-types '["TABLES","FORMS"]' \
              --notification-channel "SNSTopicArn=arn:snsTopic,RoleArn=roleArn"

       Windows:

          aws textract start-document-analysis \
              --document-location "{\"S3Object\":{\"Bucket\":\"bucket\",\"Name\":\"document\"}}" \
              --feature-types "[\"TABLES\", \"FORMS\"]" \
              --region region-name \
              --notification-channel "SNSTopicArn=arn:snsTopic,RoleArn=roleArn"

       Output:

          {
              "JobId": "df7cf32ebbd2a5de113535fcf4d921926a701b09b4e7d089f3aebadb41e0712b"
          }

       For more information, see Detecting and Analyzing  Text  in  Multi-Page
       Documents in the Amazon Textract Developers Guide

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          The  identifier  for  the  document text detection job. Use JobId to
          identify the job in a subsequent call to GetDocumentAnalysis . A Jo-
          bId value is only valid for 7 days.
