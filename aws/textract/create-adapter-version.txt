CREATE-ADAPTER-VERSION()                              CREATE-ADAPTER-VERSION()



NAME
       create-adapter-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new version of an adapter. Operates on a provided AdapterId
       and a specified dataset provided via the  DatasetConfig  argument.  Re-
       quires that you specify an Amazon S3 bucket with the OutputConfig argu-
       ment. You can provide an optional KMSKeyId, an optional  ClientRequest-
       Token, and optional tags.

OPTIONS
       --adapter-id (string)
          A  string containing a unique ID for the adapter that will receive a
          new version.

       --client-request-token (string)
          Idempotent token is used to recognize the request. If the same token
          is  used  with multiple CreateAdapterVersion requests, the same ses-
          sion is returned. This token is employed  to  avoid  unintentionally
          creating the same session multiple times.

       --dataset-config (structure)
          Specifies  a  dataset  used  to train a new adapter version. Takes a
          ManifestS3Object as the value.

          ManifestS3Object -> (structure)
              The S3 bucket name and file name that identifies the document.

              The AWS Region for the S3 bucket that contains the document must
              match the Region that you use for Amazon Textract operations.

              For  Amazon Textract to process a file in an S3 bucket, the user
              must have permission to access the S3 bucket and file.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket. Note that the # character  is  not
                 valid in the file name.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  file  name of the input document. Synchronous operations
                 can use image files that are in JPEG or PNG format. Asynchro-
                 nous operations also support PDF and TIFF format files.

              Version -> (string)
                 If the bucket has versioning enabled, you can specify the ob-
                 ject version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ManifestS3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ManifestS3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The identifier for your AWS Key  Management  Service  key  (AWS  KMS
          key). Used to encrypt your documents.

       --output-config (structure)
          Sets  whether  or  not your output will go to a user created bucket.
          Used to set the name of the bucket, and the  prefix  on  the  output
          file.
              OutputConfig  is  an  optional  parameter  which lets you adjust
              where your output will be placed. By  default,  Amazon  Textract
              will  store  the  results internally and can only be accessed by
              the Get API operations. With OutputConfig enabled, you  can  set
              the  name of the bucket the output will be sent to the file pre-
              fix of the results where you can download  your  results.  Addi-
              tionally,  you can set the KMSKeyID parameter to a customer mas-
              ter key (CMK) to encrypt your output. Without this parameter set
              Amazon  Textract  will encrypt server-side using the AWS managed
              CMK for Amazon S3.

          Decryption of Customer Content is necessary for  processing  of  the
          documents  by Amazon Textract. If your account is opted out under an
          AI services opt out policy then all unencrypted Customer Content  is
          immediately  and  permanently deleted after the Customer Content has
          been processed by the service. No copy of of the output is  retained
          by  Amazon  Textract.  For  information  about  how  to opt out, see
          Managing AI services opt-out policy.

          S3Bucket -> (string)
              The name of the bucket your output will go to.

          S3Prefix -> (string)
              The prefix of the object key that the output will be  saved  to.
              When not enabled, the prefix will be textract_output".

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Bucket=string,S3Prefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Bucket": "string",
            "S3Prefix": "string"
          }

       --tags (map)
          A  set  of  tags  (key-value  pairs)  that you want to attach to the
          adapter version.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
