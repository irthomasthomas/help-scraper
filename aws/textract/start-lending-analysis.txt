START-LENDING-ANALYSIS()                              START-LENDING-ANALYSIS()



NAME
       start-lending-analysis -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts   the   classification   and  analysis  of  an  input  document.
       StartLendingAnalysis initiates the classification  and  analysis  of  a
       packet  of  lending documents. StartLendingAnalysis operates on a docu-
       ment file located in an Amazon S3 bucket.
          StartLendingAnalysis can analyze text in documents that are  in  one
          of the following formats: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, PDF. Use DocumentLocation
          to specify the bucket name and the file name of the document.

          StartLendingAnalysis returns a job identifier (JobId ) that you  use
          to  get the results of the operation. When the text analysis is fin-
          ished, Amazon Textract publishes a completion status to  the  Amazon
          Simple  Notification  Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you specify in
          NotificationChannel . To get the results of the text analysis opera-
          tion,  first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS
          topic is SUCCEEDED. If the status is SUCCEEDED you can  call  either
          GetLendingAnalysis  or GetLendingAnalysisSummary and provide the Jo-
          bId to obtain the results of the analysis.

       If using OutputConfig to specify an Amazon S3 bucket, the  output  will
       be  contained  within  the specified prefix in a directory labeled with
       the job-id. In the directory there are 3 sub-directories:

       o detailedResponse (contains the GetLendingAnalysis response)

       o summaryResponse (for the GetLendingAnalysisSummary response)

       o splitDocuments (documents split across logical boundaries)

OPTIONS
       --document-location (structure)
          The Amazon S3 bucket that contains the  document  to  be  processed.
          It's used by asynchronous operations.

          The  input  document  can be an image file in JPEG or PNG format. It
          can also be a file in PDF format.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 bucket that contains the input document.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket. Note that the # character  is  not
                 valid in the file name.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  file  name of the input document. Synchronous operations
                 can use image files that are in JPEG or PNG format. Asynchro-
                 nous operations also support PDF and TIFF format files.

              Version -> (string)
                 If the bucket has versioning enabled, you can specify the ob-
                 ject version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          The idempotent token that you use to identify the start request.  If
          you  use the same token with multiple StartLendingAnalysis requests,
          the same JobId is returned. Use ClientRequestToken  to  prevent  the
          same  job  from  being accidentally started more than once. For more
          information, see Calling Amazon Textract Asynchronous Operations .

       --job-tag (string)
          An identifier that you specify to be included in the completion  no-
          tification  published  to the Amazon SNS topic. For example, you can
          use JobTag to identify the type of document that the completion  no-
          tification corresponds to (such as a tax form or a receipt).

       --notification-channel (structure)
          The  Amazon  Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to which
          Amazon Textract publishes the completion status of  an  asynchronous
          document operation.

          SNSTopicArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  SNS topic that Amazon Textract posts the completion
              status to.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that gives  Amazon
              Textract publishing permissions to the Amazon SNS topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SNSTopicArn=string,RoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SNSTopicArn": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string"
          }

       --output-config (structure)
          Sets  whether  or  not your output will go to a user created bucket.
          Used to set the name of the bucket, and the  prefix  on  the  output
          file.
              OutputConfig  is  an  optional  parameter  which lets you adjust
              where your output will be placed. By  default,  Amazon  Textract
              will  store  the  results internally and can only be accessed by
              the Get API operations. With OutputConfig enabled, you  can  set
              the  name of the bucket the output will be sent to the file pre-
              fix of the results where you can download  your  results.  Addi-
              tionally,  you can set the KMSKeyID parameter to a customer mas-
              ter key (CMK) to encrypt your output. Without this parameter set
              Amazon  Textract  will encrypt server-side using the AWS managed
              CMK for Amazon S3.

          Decryption of Customer Content is necessary for  processing  of  the
          documents  by Amazon Textract. If your account is opted out under an
          AI services opt out policy then all unencrypted Customer Content  is
          immediately  and  permanently deleted after the Customer Content has
          been processed by the service. No copy of of the output is  retained
          by  Amazon  Textract.  For  information  about  how  to opt out, see
          Managing AI services opt-out policy.

          For more information on data privacy, see the Data Privacy FAQ .

          S3Bucket -> (string)
              The name of the bucket your output will go to.

          S3Prefix -> (string)
              The prefix of the object key that the output will be  saved  to.
              When not enabled, the prefix will be textract_output".

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Bucket=string,S3Prefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Bucket": "string",
            "S3Prefix": "string"
          }

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The  KMS  key  used to encrypt the inference results. This can be in
          either Key ID or Key Alias format. When a KMS key is  provided,  the
          KMS  key  will  be used for server-side encryption of the objects in
          the customer bucket. When this parameter is not enabled, the  result
          will be encrypted server side, using SSE-S3.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the lending or text-detection job. The JobId
          is returned from StartLendingAnalysis . A JobId value is only  valid
          for 7 days.
