NAME
       analyze-expense -

DESCRIPTION
          AnalyzeExpense  synchronously  analyzes an input document for finan-
          cially related relationships between text.

       Information is returned as ExpenseDocuments and seperated as follows:

       o LineItemGroups - A data set containing LineItems which store informa-
         tion about the lines of text, such as an item purchased and its price
         on a receipt.

       o SummaryFields - Contains all other information  a  receipt,  such  as
         header information or the vendors name.

OPTIONS
       --document (structure)
          The input document, either as bytes or as an S3 object.

          You  pass  image  bytes to an Amazon Textract API operation by using
          the Bytes property. For example, you would use the Bytes property to
          pass  a document loaded from a local file system. Image bytes passed
          by using the Bytes property must be base64 encoded. Your code  might
          not need to encode document file bytes if you're using an AWS SDK to
          call Amazon Textract API operations.

          You pass images stored in an S3 bucket to an Amazon Textract API op-
          eration  by  using  the S3Object property. Documents stored in an S3
          bucket don't need to be base64 encoded.

          The AWS Region for the S3 bucket that contains the  S3  object  must
          match the AWS Region that you use for Amazon Textract operations.

          If  you  use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Textract operations, passing
          image bytes using the Bytes property isn't supported. You must first
          upload the document to an Amazon S3 bucket, and then call the opera-
          tion using the S3Object property.

          For Amazon Textract to process an S3 object, the user must have per-
          mission to access the S3 object.

          Bytes -> (blob)
              A  blob  of base64-encoded document bytes. The maximum size of a
              document that's provided in a blob of bytes is 5 MB.  The  docu-
              ment bytes must be in PNG or JPEG format.

              If  you're  using  an AWS SDK to call Amazon Textract, you might
              not need to base64-encode image bytes  passed  using  the  Bytes
              field.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              Identifies an S3 object as the document source. The maximum size
              of a document that's stored in an S3 bucket is 5 MB.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket. Note that the # character  is  not
                 valid in the file name.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  file  name of the input document. Synchronous operations
                 can use image files that are in JPEG or PNG format. Asynchro-
                 nous operations also support PDF and TIFF format files.

              Version -> (string)
                 If the bucket has versioning enabled, you can specify the ob-
                 ject version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Bytes=blob,S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Bytes": blob,
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                                                 For  example,  if  the  input
                                                 document is 700 x 200 and the
                                                 operation  returns  X=0.5 and
                                                 Y=0.25, then the point is  at
                                                 the (350,50) pixel coordinate
                                                 on the document page.

                                   GroupProperties -> (list)
                                      Shows  which group a response object be-
                                      longs to, such  as  whether  an  address
                                      line  belongs to the vendor's address or
                                      the recipent's address.

                                      (structure)

                                          hard to determine via JSON response.

                                          Types -> (list)
                                             Informs you on  whether  the  ex-
                                             pense  group  is a name or an ad-
                                             dress.

                                             (string)

                                          Id -> (string)
                                             Provides a group Id number, which
                                             will  be the same for each in the
                                             group.

              Blocks -> (list)
                 This is a block object, the same as reported when DetectDocu-
                 mentText  is run on a document. It provides word level recog-
                 nition of text.

                 (structure)
                     A Block represents items that are recognized in  a  docu-
                     ment  within  a  group of pixels close to each other. The
                     information returned in a Block  object  depends  on  the
                     type  of  operation. In text detection for documents (for
                     example  DetectDocumentText ), you get information  about
                     the  detected  words  and lines of text. In text analysis
                     (for example  AnalyzeDocument ), you can also get  infor-
                     mation  about  the fields, tables, and selection elements
                     that are detected in the document.

                     An array of Block objects is returned by both synchronous
                     and  asynchronous  operations. In synchronous operations,
                     such as  DetectDocumentText , the array of Block  objects
                     is the entire set of results. In asynchronous operations,
                     such as  GetDocumentAnalysis , the array is returned over
                     one or more responses.

                     BlockType -> (string)
                        The type of text item that's recognized. In operations
                        for text detection, the following types are returned:

                        o PAGE - Contains a list of  the  LINE  Block  objects
                          that are detected on a document page.

                        o WORD - A word detected on a document page. A word is
                          one or more ISO basic Latin script  characters  that
                          aren't separated by spaces.

                        o LINE  -  A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words
                          that are detected on a document page.

                        In text analysis operations, the following  types  are
                        returned:

                        o PAGE  -  Contains a list of child Block objects that
                          are detected on a document page.

                        o KEY_VALUE_SET - Stores the KEY and VALUE  Block  ob-
                          jects  for linked text that's detected on a document
                          page. Use the EntityType field  to  determine  if  a
                          KEY_VALUE_SET  object  is  a  KEY  Block object or a
                          VALUE Block object.

                        o WORD - A word that's detected on a document page.  A
                          word  is  one or more ISO basic Latin script charac-
                          ters that aren't separated by spaces.

                        o LINE - A string of tab-delimited,  contiguous  words
                          that are detected on a document page.

                        o TABLE  - A table that's detected on a document page.
                          A table is grid-based information with two  or  more
                          rows or columns, with a cell span of one row and one
                          column each.

                        o CELL - A cell within a detected table. The  cell  is
                          the  parent  of  the block that contains the text in
                          the cell.

                        o SELECTION_ELEMENT - A selection element such  as  an
                          option  button  (radio button) or a check box that's
                          detected on a document page. Use the value of Selec-
                          tionStatus  to determine the status of the selection
                          element.

                        o SIGNATURE - The location and confidene  score  of  a
                          signature  detected  on  a document page. Can be re-
                          turned as part of a Key-Value  pair  or  a  detected
                          cell.

                        o QUERY - A question asked during the call of Analyze-
                          Document. Contains an alias and an ID that  attaches
                          it to its answer.

                        o QUERY_RESULT - A response to a question asked during
                          the call of analyze document. Comes  with  an  alias
                          and ID for ease of locating in a response. Also con-
                          tains location and confidence score.

                     Confidence -> (float)
                        The confidence score that Amazon Textract has  in  the
                        accuracy  of  the  recognized text and the accuracy of
                        the geometry points around the recognized text.

                     Text -> (string)
                        The word or line of text that's recognized  by  Amazon

                     RowIndex -> (integer)
                        The row in which a table cell is  located.  The  first
                        row  position is 1. RowIndex isn't returned by Detect-
                        DocumentText and GetDocumentTextDetection .

                     ColumnIndex -> (integer)
                        The column in which a table cell  appears.  The  first

                        columns  spanned  is  greater than 1. ColumnSpan isn't
                        returned by DetectDocumentText and  GetDocumentTextDe-
                        tection .

                     Geometry -> (structure)
                        The  location  of the recognized text on the image. It
                        includes an axis-aligned,  coarse  bounding  box  that
                        surrounds the text, and a finer-grain polygon for more
                        accurate spatial information.

                        BoundingBox -> (structure)
                            An axis-aligned coarse representation of the loca-

                            Height -> (float)
                               The height of the bounding box as  a  ratio  of
                               the overall document page height.

                            Left -> (float)
                               The  left  coordinate  of the bounding box as a
                               ratio of overall document page width.

                            Top -> (float)
                               The top coordinate of the bounding box as a ra-

                        Polygon -> (list)
                            Within  the  bounding  box, a fine-grained polygon
                            around the recognized item.

                            (structure)
                               The X and Y coordinates of a point on  a  docu-
                               ment page. The X and Y values that are returned
                               are ratios of the overall document  page  size.
                               For example, if the input document is 700 x 200
                               and the operation  returns  X=0.5  and  Y=0.25,
                               then the point is at the (350,50) pixel coordi-
                               nate on the document page.

                               An array of Point objects,  Polygon  ,  is  re-
                               turned  by  DetectDocumentText . Polygon repre-
                               sents a fine-grained  polygon  around  detected
                               text. For more information, see Geometry in the
                               Amazon Textract Developer Guide.

                               X -> (float)
                                   The value of the X coordinate for  a  point
                                   on a Polygon .

                               Y -> (float)
                                   The  value  of the Y coordinate for a point
                                   on a Polygon .

                     Id -> (string)
                        The identifier for the recognized text. The identifier
                        is only unique for a single operation.

                     Relationships -> (list)
                        A list of child blocks of the current block. For exam-
                        ple, a LINE object has  child  blocks  for  each  WORD
                        block  that's  part  of the line of text. There aren't
                        Relationship objects in  the  list  for  relationships
                        that  don't  exist, such as when the current block has
                        no child blocks. The list size can be the following:

                        o 0 - The block has no child blocks.

                        o 1 - The block has child blocks.

                        (structure)
                            Information about how blocks are related  to  each
                            other.  A Block object contains 0 or more Relation
                            objects in a list, Relationships . For more infor-
                            mation, see  Block .

                            The  Type  element  provides the type of the rela-
                            tionship for all blocks in the IDs array.

                            Type -> (string)
                               The type of relationship that the blocks in the
                               IDs  array have with the current block. The re-
                               lationship can be VALUE or CHILD . A  relation-
                               ship  of type VALUE is a list that contains the
                               ID of the VALUE block  that's  associated  with
                               the  KEY of a key-value pair. A relationship of
                               type CHILD is a list of IDs that identify  WORD
                               blocks  in the case of lines Cell blocks in the
                               case of Tables, and WORD blocks in the case  of
                               Selection Elements.

                            Ids -> (list)
                               An array of IDs for related blocks. You can get
                               the type of the relationship from the Type ele-
                               ment.

                               (string)

                     EntityTypes -> (list)
                        The type of entity. The following can be returned:

                        o KEY - An identifier for a field on the document.

                        o VALUE - The field text.
                            EntityTypes  isn't  returned by DetectDocumentText
                            and GetDocumentTextDetection .

                        (string)

                     SelectionStatus -> (string)
                        The selection status of a selection element,  such  as
                        an option button or check box.

                     Page -> (integer)
                        The  page  on  which a block was detected. Page is re-
                        turned by  synchronous  and  asynchronous  operations.
                        Page  values greater than 1 are only returned for mul-
                        tipage documents that are in PDF  or  TIFF  format.  A
                        scanned  image  (JPEG/PNG) provided to an asynchronous
                        operation,  even  if  it  contains  multiple  document
                        pages,  is  considered  a  single-page  document. This
                        means that for scanned images the value of Page is al-
                        ways  1.  Synchronous  operations operations will also
                        return a Page value of 1 because every input  document
                        is considered to be a single-page document.

                     Query -> (structure)
                        Text -> (string)
                            Question  that  Amazon  Textract will apply to the
                            document. An example would be "What  is  the  cus-
                            tomer's SSN?"

                        Alias -> (string)
                            Alias attached to the query, for ease of location.

                        Pages -> (list)
                            Pages is a parameter that the user inputs to spec-
                            ify which pages to apply a query to. The following
                            is a list of rules for using this parameter.

                            o If  a  page is not specified, it is set to ["1"]
                              by default.

                            o The following characters are allowed in the  pa-
                              rameter's  string:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 - * . No
                              whitespace is allowed.

                            o When using * to indicate all pages, it  must  be
                              the only element in the list.

                            o You  can  use page intervals, such as [1-3, 1-1,
                              4-*] . Where * indicates last page of document.

                            o Specified pages must be greater than 0 and  less
                              than or equal to the number of pages in the doc-
                              ument.
