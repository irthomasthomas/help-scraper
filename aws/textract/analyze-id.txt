ANALYZE-ID()                                                      ANALYZE-ID()



NAME
       analyze-id -

DESCRIPTION
       Analyzes  identity documents for relevant information. This information
       is extracted and returned as  IdentityDocumentFields  ,  which  records
       both  the normalized field and value of the extracted text.Unlike other
       Amazon Textract operations, AnalyzeID doesn't return any Geometry data.

OPTIONS
       --document-pages (list)
          The document being passed to AnalyzeID.

          (structure)
              The input document, either as bytes or as an S3 object.

              You pass image bytes to an Amazon Textract API operation by  us-
              ing  the  Bytes  property.  For example, you would use the Bytes
              property to pass a document loaded from a local file system. Im-
              age  bytes passed by using the Bytes property must be base64 en-
              coded. Your code might not need to encode document file bytes if
              you're using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Textract API operations.

              You pass images stored in an S3 bucket to an Amazon Textract API
              operation by using the S3Object property. Documents stored in an
              S3 bucket don't need to be base64 encoded.

              The  AWS  Region  for  the S3 bucket that contains the S3 object
              must match the AWS Region that you use for Amazon Textract oper-
              ations.

              If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Textract operations, pass-
              ing image bytes using the Bytes property  isn't  supported.  You
              must  first upload the document to an Amazon S3 bucket, and then
              call the operation using the S3Object property.

              For Amazon Textract to process an S3 object, the user must  have
              permission to access the S3 object.

              Bytes -> (blob)
                 A  blob of base64-encoded document bytes. The maximum size of
                 a document that's provided in a blob of bytes is  5  MB.  The
                 document bytes must be in PNG or JPEG format.

                 If you're using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Textract, you might
                 not need to base64-encode image bytes passed using the  Bytes
                 field.

              S3Object -> (structure)
                 Identifies  an  S3 object as the document source. The maximum
                 size of a document that's stored in an S3 bucket is 5 MB.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     The name of the S3 bucket. Note that the #  character  is
                     not valid in the file name.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The  file  name of the input document. Synchronous opera-
                     tions can use image files that are in JPEG or PNG format.
                     Asynchronous  operations also support PDF and TIFF format
                     files.

                 Version -> (string)
                     If the bucket has versioning enabled, you can specify the
                     object version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Bytes=blob,S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Bytes": blob,
              "S3Object": {
                "Bucket": "string",
                "Name": "string",
                "Version": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
