UPDATE-ROUTING-CONTROL-STATE()                  UPDATE-ROUTING-CONTROL-STATE()



NAME
       update-routing-control-state -

DESCRIPTION
       Set  the  state  of the routing control to reroute traffic. You can set
       the value to be On or Off. When the state is On,  traffic  flows  to  a
       cell. When the state is Off, traffic does not flow.

       With Route 53 ARC, you can add safety rules for routing controls, which
       are safeguards for routing control state updates that help prevent  un-
       expected  outcomes,  like fail open traffic routing. However, there are
       scenarios when you might want to bypass the routing control  safeguards
       that  are  enforced with safety rules that you've configured. For exam-
       ple, you might want to fail over quickly for disaster recovery, and one
       or more safety rules might be unexpectedly preventing you from updating
       a routing control state to reroute traffic. In a "break glass" scenario
       like  this, you can override one or more safety rules to change a rout-
       ing control state and fail over your application.

       The SafetyRulesToOverride property enables you  override  one  or  more
       safety  rules  and update routing control states. For more information,
       see Override safety rules to reroute traffic in the Amazon Route 53 Ap-
       plication Recovery Controller Developer Guide.
          You  must  specify Regional endpoints when you work with API cluster
          operations to get or update routing control states in Route 53 ARC.

       To see a code example for getting a routing  control  state,  including
       accessing  Regional  cluster endpoints in sequence, see API examples in
       the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.

OPTIONS
       --routing-control-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the routing control that you want
          to update the state for.

       --routing-control-state (string)
          The  state of the routing control. You can set the value to be On or
          Off.

          Possible values:

          o On

          o Off

       --safety-rules-to-override (list)
          The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for the safety rules that you  want
          to override when you're updating the state of a routing control. You
          can override one safety rule or multiple safety rules  by  including
          one or more ARNs, separated by commas.

          For  more  information, see Override safety rules to reroute traffic
          in the Amazon Route 53  Application  Recovery  Controller  Developer
          Guide.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       None
