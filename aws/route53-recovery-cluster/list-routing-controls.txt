LIST-ROUTING-CONTROLS()                                LIST-ROUTING-CONTROLS()



NAME
       list-routing-controls -

DESCRIPTION
       List routing control names and Amazon Resource Names (ARNs), as well as
       the routing control state for each routing control, along with the con-
       trol  panel name and control panel ARN for the routing controls. If you
       specify a control panel ARN, this call lists the  routing  controls  in
       the  control panel. Otherwise, it lists all the routing controls in the
       cluster.

       A routing control is a simple on/off switch in Route 53  ARC  that  you
       can  use to route traffic to cells. When a routing control state is set
       to ON, traffic flows to a cell. When the state is set to  OFF,  traffic
       does not flow.

       Before  you can create a routing control, you must first create a clus-
       ter, and then host the control in a control panel on the  cluster.  For
       more  information,  see Create routing control structures in the Amazon
       Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer  Guide.  You  access
       one  of the endpoints for the cluster to get or update the routing con-
       trol state to redirect traffic for your application.
          You must specify Regional endpoints when you work with  API  cluster
          operations  to  use  this  API operation to list routing controls in
          Route 53 ARC.

       Learn more about working with routing controls in the following  topics
       in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide:

       list-routing-controls  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: RoutingControls

OPTIONS
       --control-panel-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the control panel of  the  routing
          controls to list.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       RoutingControls -> (list)
          The list of routing controls.

          (structure)
              A routing control, which is a simple on/off switch that you  can
              use  to  route traffic to cells. When a routing control state is
              set to ON, traffic flows to a cell. When the  state  is  set  to
              OFF, traffic does not flow.

              ControlPanelArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the control panel where the
                 routing control is located.

              ControlPanelName -> (string)
                 The name of the control panel where the  routing  control  is
                 located.  Only  ASCII  characters  are  supported for control
                 panel names.

              RoutingControlArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the routing control.

              RoutingControlName -> (string)
                 The name of the routing control.

              RoutingControlState -> (string)
                 The current state of the routing control. When a routing con-
                 trol  state  is  set to ON, traffic flows to a cell. When the
                 state is set to OFF, traffic does not flow.

              Owner -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID  of  the  routing  control
                 owner.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results. You receive this token from a
          previous call.
