OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the Data Catalog to retrieve the security configuration
          for. If none is provided, the Amazon Web Services account ID is used
          by default.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       DataCatalogEncryptionSettings -> (structure)
          The requested security configuration.

          EncryptionAtRest -> (structure)
              Specifies the encryption-at-rest configuration for the Data Cat-
              alog.

              CatalogEncryptionMode -> (string)
                 The encryption-at-rest mode for encrypting Data Catalog data.

              SseAwsKmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The ID of the KMS key to use for encryption at rest.

              CatalogEncryptionServiceRole -> (string)
                 The role that Glue assumes to encrypt and  decrypt  the  Data
                 Catalog objects on the caller's behalf.

          ConnectionPasswordEncryption -> (structure)
              When connection password protection is enabled, the Data Catalog
              uses a customer-provided key to encrypt the password as part  of
              CreateConnection  or  UpdateConnection  and  store it in the EN-
              CRYPTED_PASSWORD field in the connection properties. You can en-
              able catalog encryption or only password encryption.

              ReturnConnectionPasswordEncrypted -> (boolean)
                 When  the  ReturnConnectionPasswordEncrypted  flag  is set to
                 "true", passwords remain encrypted in the responses  of  Get-
                 Connection  and GetConnections . This encryption takes effect
                 independently from catalog encryption.

              AwsKmsKeyId -> (string)
                 An KMS key that is used to encrypt the connection password.

                 If connection password protection is enabled, the  caller  of
                 CreateConnection  and UpdateConnection needs at least kms:En-
                 crypt permission on the specified KMS key, to  encrypt  pass-
                 words before storing them in the Data Catalog.

                 You  can set the decrypt permission to enable or restrict ac-
                 cess on the password key according to your security  require-
                 ments.
