OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The  ID of the Data Catalog where the table resides. If none is pro-
          vided, the Amazon Web Services account ID is used by default.

       --database-name (string)
          The name of the database in the catalog in which the table  resides.
          For Hive compatibility, this name is entirely lowercase.

       --name (string)
          The name of the table for which to retrieve the definition. For Hive
          compatibility, this name is entirely lowercase.

       --transaction-id (string)
          The transaction ID at which to read the table contents.

       --query-as-of-time (timestamp)
          The time as of when to read the table contents. If not set, the most
          recent  transaction  commit  time  will be used. Cannot be specified
          along with TransactionId .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

                 When  creating a table, you can pass an empty list of columns
                 for the schema, and instead use a schema reference.

                 SchemaId -> (structure)

                 You can set this flag as true to instruct the engine  not  to
                 push  user-provided  operations  into the logical plan of the
                 view during query planning. However, setting this  flag  does
                 not  guarantee  that the engine will comply. Refer to the en-
                 gine's documentation to understand the  guarantees  provided,

                        The version of the dialect of the  query  engine.  For

                        The  SELECT query provided by the customer during CRE-
                        ATE VIEW DDL . This SQL is not used during a query  on
                        a  view  (ViewExpandedText is used instead). ViewOrig-
                        inalText is used for cases like SHOW CREATE VIEW where
                        users  want  to see the original DDL command that cre-
                        ated the view.

                        The expanded SQL for the view. This SQL is used by en-
                        gines  while processing a query on a view. Engines may
                        perform operations during view creation  to  transform
                        ViewOriginalText to ViewExpandedText . For example:

                        o Fully qualify identifiers: SELECT * from table1  SE-
                          LECT * from db1.table1

                     IsStale -> (boolean)
                        Dialects marked as stale are no longer valid and  must
                        be updated before they can be queried in their respec-
                        tive query engines.

          IsMultiDialectView -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the view supports the SQL dialects of  one  or
              more  different query engines and can therefore be read by those
              engines.
