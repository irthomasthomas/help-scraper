SYNOPSIS
            get-job
          --job-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-name (string)
          The name of the job definition to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the job command. For an  Apache  Spark  ETL  job,
                 this  must  be  glueetl  . For a Python shell job, it must be
                 pythonshell . For an Apache Spark  streaming  ETL  job,  this
                 must be gluestreaming .

              You can specify  arguments  here  that  your  own  job-execution
              script consumes, as well as arguments that Glue itself consumes.

              For  information  about  how to specify and consume your own Job
              arguments, see the Calling Glue APIs in Python topic in the  de-
              veloper guide.

              For  information about the key-value pairs that Glue consumes to
              set up your job, see the Special Parameters Used by  Glue  topic
              in the developer guide.

              value -> (string)

          NonOverridableArguments -> (map)
              Non-overridable  arguments for this job, specified as name-value
              pairs.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          Connections -> (structure)
              The connections used for this job.

              Connections -> (list)
                 A list of connections used by the job.

                 (string)

          MaxRetries -> (integer)
              The maximum number of times to retry this  job  after  a  JobRun
              fails.

          AllocatedCapacity -> (integer)
              This field is deprecated. Use MaxCapacity instead.

              The  number  of  Glue  data processing units (DPUs) allocated to
              runs of this job. You can allocate a minimum of 2 DPUs; the  de-
              fault  is  10.  A  DPU is a relative measure of processing power
              that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB  of  mem-
              ory. For more information, see the Glue pricing page .

          Timeout -> (integer)
              The  job timeout in minutes. This is the maximum time that a job
              run can consume resources before it  is  terminated  and  enters
              TIMEOUT status. The default is 2,880 minutes (48 hours).

          MaxCapacity -> (double)
              For  Glue version 1.0 or earlier jobs, using the standard worker
              type, the number of Glue data processing units (DPUs)  that  can
              be  allocated when this job runs. A DPU is a relative measure of
              processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs  of  compute  capacity
              and  16 GB of memory. For more information, see the Glue pricing
              page .

              Do not set Max Capacity if using WorkerType and  NumberOfWorkers
              .

              The  value  that  can  be  allocated  for MaxCapacity depends on
              whether you are running a Python shell job, an Apache Spark  ETL
              job, or an Apache Spark streaming ETL job:

              o When you specify a Python shell job (JobCommand.Name ="python-
                shell"), you can allocate either 0.0625 or 1 DPU. The  default
                is 0.0625 DPU.

              o When  you  specify  an  Apache  Spark ETL job (JobCommand.Name
                ="glueetl") or Apache Spark streaming ETL job (JobCommand.Name
                ="gluestreaming"),  you  can allocate a minimum of 2 DPUs. The
                default is 10 DPUs. This job type cannot have a fractional DPU
                allocation.

              For  Glue version 2.0 jobs, you cannot instead specify a Maximum
              capacity . Instead, you should specify a  Worker  type  and  the
              Number of workers .

          WorkerType -> (string)
              The type of predefined worker that is allocated when a job runs.
              Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, G.2X, or G.025X.

              o For the Standard worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU,  16
                GB of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.

              o For  the  G.1X worker type, each worker maps to 1 DPU (4 vCPU,
                16 GB of memory, 64 GB disk),  and  provides  1  executor  per
                worker.  We  recommend  this  worker type for memory-intensive
                jobs.

              o For the G.2X worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU  (8  vCPU,
                32  GB  of  memory,  128 GB disk), and provides 1 executor per
                worker. We recommend this  worker  type  for  memory-intensive
                jobs.

              o For  the  G.025X  worker type, each worker maps to 0.25 DPU (2
                vCPU, 4 GB of memory, 64 GB disk), and provides 1 executor per
                worker. We recommend this worker type for low volume streaming
                jobs. This worker type is only available for Glue version  3.0
                streaming jobs.

          NumberOfWorkers -> (integer)
              The number of workers of a defined workerType that are allocated
              when a job runs.

          SecurityConfiguration -> (string)
              The name of the SecurityConfiguration structure to be used  with
              this job.

          NotificationProperty -> (structure)
              Specifies configuration properties of a job notification.

              NotifyDelayAfter -> (integer)
                 After  a job run starts, the number of minutes to wait before
                 sending a job run delay notification.

          GlueVersion -> (string)
              Glue version determines the versions of Apache Spark and  Python
              that  Glue  supports.  The  Python version indicates the version
              supported for jobs of type Spark.

              For more information about the available Glue versions and  cor-
              responding  Spark  and  Python versions, see Glue version in the
              developer guide.

              Jobs that are created without specifying a Glue version  default
              to Glue 0.9.

          CodeGenConfigurationNodes -> (map)
              The representation of a directed acyclic graph on which both the
              Glue Studio visual component and Glue Studio code generation  is
              based.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                     CodeGenConfigurationNode enumerates all valid Node types.
                     One and only one of its member  variables  can  be  popu-
                     lated.

                 AthenaConnectorSource -> (structure)
                     Specifies a connector to an Amazon Athena data source.

                            cluded  with lowerBound , upperBound , and numPar-
                            titions . This option works the same way as in the
                            Spark SQL JDBC reader.

                            The  minimum value of partitionColumn that is used
                            to decide partition stride.

                        UpperBound -> (long)
                            The maximum value of partitionColumn that is  used
                            to decide partition stride.

                        NumPartitions -> (long)
                            The  number  of partitions. This value, along with
                            lowerBound (inclusive) and upperBound (exclusive),
                            form  partition strides for generated WHERE clause
                            expressions that are used to split the  partition-
                            Column .

                        JobBookmarkKeys -> (list)
                            The  name  of  the  job  bookmark keys on which to
                            sort.

                            (string)

                        JobBookmarkKeysSortOrder -> (string)
                            Specifies an ascending or descending sort order.

                        DataTypeMapping -> (map)
                            Custom data type mapping  that  builds  a  mapping
                            from  a  JDBC  data type to an Glue data type. For
                            example,      the       option       "dataTypeMap-
                            ping":{"FLOAT":"STRING"}  maps data fields of JDBC
                            type FLOAT into the Java String  type  by  calling
                            the  ResultSet.getString()  method  of the driver,
                            and uses it to build the Glue record. The  Result-
                            Set  object  is implemented by each driver, so the
                            behavior is specific to the driver you use.  Refer
                            to  the  documentation for your JDBC driver to un-
                            derstand how the driver performs the conversions.

                               (string)

                     GroupSize -> (string)
                        The target group size in bytes. The  default  is  com-
                        puted  based  on  the  input data size and the size of
                        your cluster. When there are fewer than  50,000  input
                        files,  "groupFiles"  must be set to "inPartition" for
                        this to take effect.

                     GroupFiles -> (string)
                        Grouping files is turned on by default when the  input
                        contains  more  than 50,000 files. To turn on grouping
                        with fewer than 50,000 files, set  this  parameter  to
                        "inPartition". To disable grouping when there are more
                        than 50,000 files, set this parameter to "none" .

                     Recurse -> (boolean)
                        If set to true, recursively reads files in all  subdi-
                        rectories under the specified paths.

                     MaxBand -> (integer)
                        This  option controls the duration in milliseconds af-
                        ter which the s3 listing is likely to  be  consistent.
                        Files  with modification timestamps falling within the
                        last maxBand milliseconds are tracked  specially  when
                        using  JobBookmarks  to account for Amazon S3 eventual
                        consistency. Most users don't need to set this option.
                        The default is 900000 milliseconds, or 15 minutes.

                     MaxFilesInBand -> (integer)
                        This  option  specifies the maximum number of files to
                        save from the last maxBand seconds. If this number  is
                        exceeded,  extra  files are skipped and only processed
                        in the next job run.

                     AdditionalOptions -> (structure)
                        Specifies additional connection options.

                        BoundedSize -> (long)
                            Sets the upper limit for the target  size  of  the
                            dataset in bytes that will be processed.

                        BoundedFiles -> (long)
                            Sets  the  upper  limit  for  the target number of
                            files that will be processed.

                        EnableSamplePath -> (boolean)
                            Sets option to enable a sample path.

                        SamplePath -> (string)

                     Separator -> (string)
                        Specifies the delimiter character. The  default  is  a
                        comma: ",", but any other character can be specified.

                     Escaper -> (string)
                        Specifies a character to use for escaping. This option
                        is used only when reading CSV files. The default value
                        is  none . If enabled, the character which immediately
                        follows is used as-is,  except  for  a  small  set  of
                        well-known escapes (\n , \r , \t , and \0 ).

                     QuoteChar -> (string)
                        Specifies  the  character  to use for quoting. The de-
                        fault is a double quote: '"' . Set this to -1 to  turn
                        off quoting entirely.

                     Multiline -> (boolean)
                        A Boolean value that specifies whether a single record
                        can span multiple lines. This can occur when  a  field
                        contains  a  quoted  new-line  character. You must set
                        this option to  True  if  any  record  spans  multiple
                        lines.  The  default value is False , which allows for
                        more aggressive file-splitting during parsing.

                     WithHeader -> (boolean)
                        A Boolean value that specifies whether  to  treat  the
                        first line as a header. The default value is False .

                     WriteHeader -> (boolean)
                        A  Boolean  value  that specifies whether to write the
                        header to output. The default value is True .

                     SkipFirst -> (boolean)
                        A Boolean value that specifies  whether  to  skip  the
                        first data line. The default value is False .

                     OptimizePerformance -> (boolean)
                        A  Boolean value that specifies whether to use the ad-
                        vanced SIMD CSV reader along with Apache  Arrow  based
                        columnar  memory  formats. Only available in Glue ver-
                        sion 3.0.

                     OutputSchemas -> (list)

                        puted  based  on  the  input data size and the size of
                        your cluster. When there are fewer than  50,000  input
                        files,  "groupFiles"  must be set to "inPartition" for
                        this to take effect.

                     GroupFiles -> (string)
                        Grouping files is turned on by default when the  input

                        with fewer than 50,000 files, set  this  parameter  to
                        "inPartition". To disable grouping when there are more
                        than 50,000 files, set this parameter to "none" .

                        ter which the s3 listing is likely to  be  consistent.
                        Files  with modification timestamps falling within the
                        last maxBand milliseconds are tracked  specially  when
                        using  JobBookmarks  to account for Amazon S3 eventual
                        consistency. Most users don't need to set this option.
                        The default is 900000 milliseconds, or 15 minutes.

                     MaxFilesInBand -> (integer)
                        This  option  specifies the maximum number of files to
                        save from the last maxBand seconds. If this number  is
                        exceeded,  extra  files are skipped and only processed
                        in the next job run.

                     AdditionalOptions -> (structure)
                        Specifies additional connection options.

                        A Boolean value that specifies whether a single record
                        can  span  multiple lines. This can occur when a field
                        contains a quoted new-line  character.  You  must  set
                        this  option  to  True  if  any  record spans multiple
                        lines. The default value is False , which  allows  for
                        more aggressive file-splitting during parsing.
