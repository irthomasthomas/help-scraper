OPTIONS
       --integration-identifier (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the integration.

       --marker (string)
          A  value  that  indicates the starting point for the next set of re-
          sponse records in a subsequent request.

       --max-records (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the output.

       --filters (list)
          A list of key and values, to filter down the results. Supported keys
          are "Status", "IntegrationName", and "SourceArn". IntegrationName is
          limited to only one value.

          (structure)
              A filter that can be used when invoking  a  DescribeIntegrations
              request.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 A list of filter values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                 (structure)
                     The Tag object represents a label that you can assign  to
                     an  Amazon  Web Services resource. Each tag consists of a
                     key and an optional value, both of which you define.

                     For more information about tags, and  controlling  access
                     to  resources  in  Glue,  see Amazon Web Services Tags in

                     key -> (string)
                        The tag key. The key is required when you create a tag
                        on an object. The key is case-sensitive, and must  not

                        tag on an object. The  value  is  case-sensitive,  and
                        must not contain the prefix aws.

                 The possible statuses are:

                 o CREATING: The integration is being created.

                 o ACTIVE: The integration creation succeeds.

                 o MODIFYING: The integration is being modified.

                 o FAILED: The integration creation fails.

                 o DELETING: The integration is deleted.

                 o SYNCING: The integration is synchronizing.

                 o NEEDS_ATTENTION:  The  integration needs attention, such as
                   synchronization.

                     ErrorCode -> (string)
                        The code associated with this error.

                     ErrorMessage -> (string)
                        A message describing the error.

              DataFilter -> (string)
