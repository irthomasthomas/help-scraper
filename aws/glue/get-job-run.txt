GET-JOB-RUN()                                                    GET-JOB-RUN()



NAME
       get-job-run -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the metadata for a given job run.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-job-run
          --job-name <value>
          --run-id <value>
          [--predecessors-included | --no-predecessors-included]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-name (string)
          Name of the job definition being run.

       --run-id (string)
          The ID of the job run.

       --predecessors-included | --no-predecessors-included (boolean)
          True if a list of predecessor runs should be returned.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about a job run

       The  following  get-job-run  example  retrieves information about a job
       run.

              The  job  arguments  associated with this run. For this job run,
              they replace the default arguments set in the job definition it-
              self.

              You  can  specify  arguments  here  that  your own job-execution
              script consumes, as well as arguments that Glue itself consumes.

              For information about how to specify and consume  your  own  job
              arguments,  see the Calling Glue APIs in Python topic in the de-
              veloper guide.

              For information about the key-value pairs that Glue consumes  to
              set  up  your job, see the Special Parameters Used by Glue topic
              in the developer guide.

              key -> (string)

          PredecessorRuns -> (list)
              A list of predecessors to this job run.

              (structure)
                 A job run that was used in the  predicate  of  a  conditional
                 trigger that triggered this job run.

                 JobName -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the job definition used by the predecessor
                     job run.

                 RunId -> (string)
                     The job-run ID of the predecessor job run.

          AllocatedCapacity -> (integer)
              This field is deprecated. Use MaxCapacity instead.

              The number of Glue data processing  units  (DPUs)  allocated  to
              this JobRun. From 2 to 100 DPUs can be allocated; the default is
              10. A DPU is a relative measure of processing  power  that  con-
              sists  of  4  vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For
              more information, see the Glue pricing page .

          ExecutionTime -> (integer)
              The amount of time (in seconds) that the job  run  consumed  re-
              sources.

          Timeout -> (integer)
              The  JobRun  timeout in minutes. This is the maximum time that a
              job run can consume resources before it is terminated and enters
              TIMEOUT  status.  This  value overrides the timeout value set in
              the parent job.

              Streaming  jobs  do  not  have  a  timeout.  The   default   for
              non-streaming jobs is 2,880 minutes (48 hours).

          MaxCapacity -> (double)
              The  number of Glue data processing units (DPUs) that can be al-
              located when this job runs. A DPU is a relative measure of  pro-
              cessing  power  that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and
              16 GB of memory. For more information, see the Glue pricing page
              .

              Do  not set Max Capacity if using WorkerType and NumberOfWorkers
              .

              The value that can  be  allocated  for  MaxCapacity  depends  on
              whether  you  are  running a Python shell job or an Apache Spark
              ETL job:

              o When you specify a Python shell job (JobCommand.Name ="python-
                shell"),  you can allocate either 0.0625 or 1 DPU. The default
                is 0.0625 DPU.

              o When you specify an  Apache  Spark  ETL  job  (JobCommand.Name
                ="glueetl"), you can allocate a minimum of 2 DPUs. The default
                is 10 DPUs. This job type cannot have a fractional DPU alloca-
                tion.

          WorkerType -> (string)
              The type of predefined worker that is allocated when a job runs.
              Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, G.2X, or G.025X.

              o For the Standard worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU,  16
                GB of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.

              o For  the  G.1X worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB
                of memory and a 64GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.

              o For the G.2X worker type, each worker provides 8 vCPU,  32  GB
                of memory and a 128GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.

              o For  the  G.025X  worker type, each worker maps to 0.25 DPU (2
                vCPU, 4 GB of memory, 64 GB disk), and provides 1 executor per
                worker. We recommend this worker type for low volume streaming
                jobs. This worker type is only available for Glue version  3.0
                streaming jobs.

          NumberOfWorkers -> (integer)
              The number of workers of a defined workerType that are allocated
              when a job runs.

          SecurityConfiguration -> (string)
              The name of the SecurityConfiguration structure to be used  with
              this job run.

          LogGroupName -> (string)
              The  name  of  the  log  group  for  secure  logging that can be
              server-side encrypted in Amazon CloudWatch using KMS. This  name
              can be /aws-glue/jobs/ , in which case the default encryption is
              NONE . If you add a role name and SecurityConfiguration name (in
              other  words, /aws-glue/jobs-yourRoleName-yourSecurityConfigura-
              tionName/ ), then that security configuration is used to encrypt
              the log group.

          NotificationProperty -> (structure)
              Specifies configuration properties of a job run notification.

              NotifyDelayAfter -> (integer)
                 After  a job run starts, the number of minutes to wait before
                 sending a job run delay notification.

          GlueVersion -> (string)
              Glue version determines the versions of Apache Spark and  Python
              that  Glue  supports.  The  Python version indicates the version
              supported for jobs of type Spark.

              For more information about the available Glue versions and  cor-
              responding  Spark  and  Python versions, see Glue version in the
              developer guide.

              Jobs that are created without specifying a Glue version  default
              to Glue 0.9.

          DPUSeconds -> (double)
              This  field populates only for Auto Scaling job runs, and repre-
              sents the total time each executor ran during the lifecycle of a
              job  run  in seconds, multiplied by a DPU factor (1 for G.1X , 2
              for G.2X , or 0.25 for G.025X workers). This value may  be  dif-
              ferent  than  the executionEngineRuntime * MaxCapacity as in the
              case of Auto Scaling jobs, as the number of executors running at
              a given time may be less than the MaxCapacity . Therefore, it is
              possible that the value of DPUSeconds  is  less  than  executio-
              nEngineRuntime * MaxCapacity .

          ExecutionClass -> (string)
              Indicates whether the job is run with a standard or flexible ex-
              ecution  class.  The  standard  execution-class  is  ideal   for
              time-sensitive workloads that require fast job startup and dedi-
              cated resources.

              The flexible execution class is appropriate for time-insensitive
              jobs whose start and completion times may vary.

              Only  jobs  with  Glue  version  3.0  and above and command type
              glueetl will be allowed to set  ExecutionClass  to  FLEX  .  The
              flexible execution class is available for Spark jobs.
