GET-PARTITION-INDEXES()                                GET-PARTITION-INDEXES()



NAME
       get-partition-indexes -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the partition indexes associated with a table.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-partition-indexes  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: PartitionIndexDescriptorList

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The catalog ID where the table resides.

       --database-name (string)
          Specifies the name of a database from which  you  want  to  retrieve
          partition indexes.

       --table-name (string)
          Specifies  the  name  of  a table for which you want to retrieve the
          partition indexes.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       PartitionIndexDescriptorList -> (list)
          A list of index descriptors.

          (structure)
              A descriptor for a partition index in a table.

              IndexName -> (string)
                 The name of the partition index.

              Keys -> (list)
                 A list of one or more keys, as  KeySchemaElement  structures,
                 for the partition index.

                 (structure)
                     A partition key pair consisting of a name and a type.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of a partition key.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The type of a partition key.

              IndexStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the partition index.

                 The possible statuses are:

                 o CREATING: The index is being created. When an index is in a
                   CREATING state, the index or its table cannot be deleted.

                 o ACTIVE: The index creation succeeds.

                 o FAILED: The index creation fails.

                 o DELETING: The index is deleted from the list of indexes.

              BackfillErrors -> (list)
                 A list of errors that can occur  when  registering  partition
                 indexes for an existing table.

                 (structure)
                     A  list  of errors that can occur when registering parti-
                     tion indexes for an existing table.

                     These errors give the details about why an  index  regis-
                     tration failed and provide a limited number of partitions
                     in the response, so that you can fix  the  partitions  at
                     fault  and try registering the index again. The most com-
                     mon set of errors that can occur are categorized as  fol-
                     lows:

                     o EncryptedPartitionError: The partitions are encrypted.

                     o InvalidPartitionTypeDataError:   The   partition  value
                       doesn't match the data type for that partition column.

                     o MissingPartitionValueError:  The  partitions  are   en-
                       crypted.

                     o UnsupportedPartitionCharacterError:  Characters  inside
                       the partition value are  not  supported.  For  example:
                       U+0000 , U+0001, U+0002.

                     o InternalError: Any error which does not belong to other
                       error codes.

                     Code -> (string)
                        The error code for an error that occurred when  regis-
                        tering partition indexes for an existing table.

                     Partitions -> (list)
                        A  list  of  a limited number of partitions in the re-
                        sponse.

                        (structure)
                            Contains a list of values defining partitions.

                            Values -> (list)
                               The list of values.

                               (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          A continuation token, present if the current list segment is not the
          last.
