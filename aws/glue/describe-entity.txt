NAME
       describe-entity -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  details  regarding  the entity used with the connection type,
       with a description of the data model for each field in the selected en-
       tity.

       The response includes all the fields which make up the entity.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-entity is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Fields

OPTIONS
       --connection-name (string)
          The name of the connection that contains the connection type creden-
          tials.

       --catalog-id (string)
          The catalog ID of the catalog that contains the connection. This can
          be null, By default, the Amazon Web Services Account ID is the cata-
          log ID.

       --entity-name (string)
          The name of the entity that you want to describe from the connection
          type.

       --data-store-api-version (string)
          The version of the API used for the data store.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
