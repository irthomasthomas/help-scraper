              'gluestreaming'.

          PythonVersion -> (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string",
            "PythonVersion": "string"
          }

       --timeout (integer)
          The  number  of  minutes before session times out. Default for Spark
          ETL jobs is 48 hours (2880 minutes), the  maximum  session  lifetime
          for this job type. Consult the documentation for other job types.

          The  number  of  minutes when idle before session times out. Default
          for Spark ETL jobs is value of Timeout.  Consult  the  documentation
          for other job types.

       --default-arguments (map)
          A map array of key-value pairs. Max is 75 pairs.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

            ...}

          The number of connections to use for the session.

          Connections -> (list)
              A list of connections used by the job.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Connections": ["string", ...]
          }

       --max-capacity (double)
          The  number  of  Glue data processing units (DPUs) that can be allo-
          cated when the job runs. A DPU is a relative measure  of  processing
          power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB memory.

       --number-of-workers (integer)
          The  number  of  workers of a defined WorkerType to use for the ses-
          sion.

       --worker-type (string)
          The type of predefined worker that is allocated when a job runs. Ac-
          cepts  a  value of G.1X, G.2X, G.4X, or G.8X for Spark jobs. Accepts
          the value Z.2X for Ray notebooks.

          o For the G.1X worker type, each worker maps to 1 DPU (4  vCPUs,  16
            GB  of  memory) with 84GB disk (approximately 34GB free), and pro-
            vides 1 executor per worker. We recommend  this  worker  type  for
            workloads such as data transforms, joins, and queries, to offers a
            scalable and cost effective way to run most jobs.

          o For the G.2X worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU (8  vCPUs,  32
            GB  of memory) with 128GB disk (approximately 77GB free), and pro-
            vides 1 executor per worker. We recommend  this  worker  type  for
            workloads such as data transforms, joins, and queries, to offers a
            scalable and cost effective way to run most jobs.

          o For the G.4X worker type, each worker maps to 4 DPU (16 vCPUs,  64
            GB of memory) with 256GB disk (approximately 235GB free), and pro-
            vides 1 executor per worker. We recommend  this  worker  type  for
            jobs  whose  workloads contain your most demanding transforms, ag-
            gregations, joins, and queries. This worker type is available only
            for Glue version 3.0 or later Spark ETL jobs in the following Ama-
            zon Web Services Regions: US East (Ohio), US East  (N.  Virginia),
            US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney),
            Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe
            (Ireland), and Europe (Stockholm).

          o For the G.8X worker type, each worker maps to 8 DPU (32 vCPUs, 128
            GB of memory) with 512GB disk (approximately 487GB free), and pro-
            vides  1  executor  per  worker. We recommend this worker type for
            jobs whose workloads contain your most demanding  transforms,  ag-
            gregations, joins, and queries. This worker type is available only
            for Glue version 3.0 or later Spark ETL jobs, in the  same  Amazon
            Web Services Regions as supported for the G.4X worker type.

          o For  the Z.2X worker type, each worker maps to 2 M-DPU (8vCPUs, 64
            GB of memory) with 128 GB disk  (approximately  120GB  free),  and
            provides up to 8 Ray workers based on the autoscaler.

          Possible values:

          o Standard

          o G.1X

          o G.2X

          o G.025X

          The map of key value pairs (tags) belonging to the session.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

            ...}

       --request-origin (string)
          The origin of the request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
