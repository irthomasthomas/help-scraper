NAME
       create-ml-transform -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an Glue machine learning transform. This operation creates the
       transform and all the necessary parameters to train it.

       Call this operation as the first step in the process of using a machine
       learning  transform (such as the FindMatches transform) for deduplicat-
       ing data. You can provide an optional Description , in addition to  the
       parameters that you want to use for your algorithm.

       You  must  also specify certain parameters for the tasks that Glue runs
       on your behalf as part of  learning  from  your  data  and  creating  a
       high-quality  machine learning transform. These parameters include Role
       , and optionally, AllocatedCapacity , Timeout , and  MaxRetries  .  For
       more information, see Jobs .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The unique name that you give the transform when you create it.

       --description (string)
          A  description  of  the machine learning transform that is being de-
          fined. The default is an empty string.

       --input-record-tables (list)
          A list of Glue table definitions used by the transform.

          (structure)
              The database and table in the Glue Data Catalog that is used for
              input or output data.

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 A database name in the Glue Data Catalog.

              TableName -> (string)
                 A table name in the Glue Data Catalog.

                   to list and read all the files in your dataset.

                 o catalogPartitionPredicate  :  to  use server-side partition
                   pruning using partition indexes in the Glue Data Catalog.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DatabaseName=string,TableName=string,CatalogId=string,ConnectionName=string,AdditionalOptions={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "DatabaseName": "string",
              "TableName": "string",
              "CatalogId": "string",
              "ConnectionName": "string",
              "AdditionalOptions": {"string": "string"
                ...}
            }
            ...
          ]

       --parameters (structure)
          The algorithmic parameters that are specific to the  transform  type
          used. Conditionally dependent on the transform type.

          TransformType -> (string)
              The type of machine learning transform.

              For  information about the types of machine learning transforms,
              see Creating Machine Learning Transforms .

          FindMatchesParameters -> (structure)
              The parameters for the find matches algorithm.

              PrimaryKeyColumnName -> (string)
                 The name of a column that uniquely  identifies  rows  in  the
                 source table. Used to help identify matching records.

              PrecisionRecallTradeoff -> (double)
                 The  value  selected when tuning your transform for a balance
                 between precision and recall. A value of 0.5 means no prefer-
                 ence; a value of 1.0 means a bias purely for precision, and a
                 value of 0.0 means a bias  for  recall.  Because  this  is  a
                 tradeoff, choosing values close to 1.0 means very low recall,
                 and choosing values close to 0.0 results in very  low  preci-
                 sion.

                 The  precision  metric indicates how often your model is cor-
                 rect when it predicts a match.

                 The recall metric indicates that for an actual match, how of-
                 ten your model predicts the match.

              AccuracyCostTradeoff -> (double)
                 The  value  that is selected when tuning your transform for a
                 balance between accuracy and cost. A value of 0.5 means  that
                 the  system  balances  accuracy and cost concerns. A value of
                 1.0 means a bias purely for accuracy, which typically results
                 in  a higher cost, sometimes substantially higher. A value of
                 0.0 means a bias purely for cost, which results in a less ac-
                 curate FindMatches transform, sometimes with unacceptable ac-
                 curacy.

                 Accuracy measures how well the transform finds true positives
                 and true negatives. Increasing accuracy requires more machine
                 resources and cost. But it also results in increased recall.

                 Cost measures how many compute resources, and thus money, are
                 consumed to run the transform.

              EnforceProvidedLabels -> (boolean)
                 The  value  to  switch on or off to force the output to match
                 the provided labels from users. If the value is  True  ,  the
                 find  matches  transform  forces the output to match the pro-
                 vided labels. The results override the normal conflation  re-
                 sults.  If  the  value  is False , the find matches transform
                 does not ensure all the labels provided  are  respected,  and
                 the results rely on the trained model.

                 Note that setting this value to true may increase the confla-
                 tion execution time.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TransformType=string,FindMatchesParameters={PrimaryKeyColumnName=string,PrecisionRecallTradeoff=double,AccuracyCostTradeoff=double,EnforceProvidedLabels=boolean}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TransformType": "FIND_MATCHES",
            "FindMatchesParameters": {
              "PrimaryKeyColumnName": "string",
              "PrecisionRecallTradeoff": double,
              "AccuracyCostTradeoff": double,
              "EnforceProvidedLabels": true|false
            }
          }

       --role (string)
          The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role with the  re-
          quired  permissions. The required permissions include both Glue ser-
          vice role permissions to Glue resources, and Amazon  S3  permissions
          required by the transform.

          o This  role  needs Glue service role permissions to allow access to
            resources in Glue. See Attach a Policy to IAM  Users  That  Access
            Glue .

          o This  role  needs permission to your Amazon Simple Storage Service
            (Amazon S3) sources, targets, temporary  directory,  scripts,  and
            any libraries used by the task run for this transform.

       --glue-version (string)
          This  value  determines  which version of Glue this machine learning
          transform is compatible with. Glue 1.0 is recommended for most  cus-
          tomers.  If the value is not set, the Glue compatibility defaults to
          Glue 0.9. For more information, see Glue Versions in  the  developer
          guide.

       --max-capacity (double)
          The  number  of Glue data processing units (DPUs) that are allocated
          to task runs for this transform. You can  allocate  from  2  to  100
          DPUs;  the  default is 10. A DPU is a relative measure of processing
          power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of mem-
          ory. For more information, see the Glue pricing page .
              MaxCapacity  is a mutually exclusive option with NumberOfWorkers
              and WorkerType .

          o If either NumberOfWorkers or WorkerType is set,  then  MaxCapacity
            cannot be set.

          o If  MaxCapacity  is set then neither NumberOfWorkers or WorkerType
            can be set.

          o If WorkerType is set, then NumberOfWorkers is required  (and  vice
            versa).

          o MaxCapacity and NumberOfWorkers must both be at least 1.

          When  the  WorkerType  field is set to a value other than Standard ,
          the MaxCapacity field is set automatically and becomes read-only.

          When the WorkerType field is set to a value other  than  Standard  ,
          the MaxCapacity field is set automatically and becomes read-only.

       --worker-type (string)
          The type of predefined worker that is allocated when this task runs.
          Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.

          o For the Standard worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU,  16  GB
            of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.

          o For  the  G.1X  worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of
            memory and a 64GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.

          o For the G.2X worker type, each worker provides 8 vCPU,  32  GB  of
            memory and a 128GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.
              MaxCapacity  is a mutually exclusive option with NumberOfWorkers
              and WorkerType .

          o If either NumberOfWorkers or WorkerType is set,  then  MaxCapacity
            cannot be set.

          o If  MaxCapacity  is set then neither NumberOfWorkers or WorkerType
            can be set.

          o If WorkerType is set, then NumberOfWorkers is required  (and  vice
            versa).

          o MaxCapacity and NumberOfWorkers must both be at least 1.

          Possible values:

          o Standard

          o G.1X

          o G.2X

       --number-of-workers (integer)
          The  number  of  workers  of a defined workerType that are allocated
          when this task runs.

          versa).

       --timeout (integer)
          The  timeout  of the task run for this transform in minutes. This is
          the maximum time that a task run for this transform can consume  re-
          sources  before  it is terminated and enters TIMEOUT status. The de-
          fault is 2,880 minutes (48 hours).

          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
