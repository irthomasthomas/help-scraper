OPTIONS
       --entries (list)
          A  list  of BatchGetTableOptimizerEntry objects specifying the table
          optimizers to retrieve.

          (structure)
              Represents a table optimizer to retrieve in the BatchGetTableOp-
              timizer operation.

              catalogId -> (string)
                 The Catalog ID of the table.

              databaseName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the database in the catalog in which the table
                 resides.

              tableName -> (string)
                 The name of the table.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of table optimizer.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          catalogId=string,databaseName=string,tableName=string,type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "catalogId": "string",
              "databaseName": "string",
              "tableName": "string",
              "type": "compaction"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
