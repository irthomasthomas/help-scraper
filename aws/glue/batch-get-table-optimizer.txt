OPTIONS
       --entries (list)
          A  list  of BatchGetTableOptimizerEntry objects specifying the table
          optimizers to retrieve.

          (structure)
              Represents a table optimizer to retrieve in the BatchGetTableOp-
              timizer operation.

              catalogId -> (string)
                 The Catalog ID of the table.

              databaseName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the database in the catalog in which the table
                 resides.

              tableName -> (string)
                 The name of the table.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of table optimizer.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          catalogId=string,databaseName=string,tableName=string,type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "catalogId": "string",
              "databaseName": "string",
              "tableName": "string",
              "type": "compaction"|"retention"|"orphan_file_deletion"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
