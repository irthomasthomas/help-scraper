GET-TABLE-VERSIONS()                                      GET-TABLE-VERSIONS()



NAME
       get-table-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a list of strings that identify available versions of a spec-
       ified table.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-table-versions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: TableVersions

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The  ID of the Data Catalog where the tables reside. If none is pro-
          vided, the Amazon Web Services account ID is used by default.

       --database-name (string)
          The database in the catalog in which the  table  resides.  For  Hive
          compatibility, this name is entirely lowercase.

       --table-name (string)
          The name of the table. For Hive compatibility, this name is entirely
          lowercase.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                        Schema Registry.

                        When  creating  a table, you can pass an empty list of
                        columns for the schema, and instead use a schema  ref-
                        erence.

                     A list of columns by which the table is partitioned. Only
                     primitive types are supported as partition keys.

                     When you create a table used by Amazon Athena, and you do
                     not specify any partitionKeys , you must at least set the
                     value of partitionKeys to an empty list. For example:
                        "PartitionKeys": []

                            with the column.

                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (string)

                     IsProtected -> (boolean)
                        You  can  set this flag as true to instruct the engine
                        not to push user-provided operations into the  logical

                        ting this flag does not guarantee that the engine will
                        comply.  Refer to the engine's documentation to under-
                        stand the guarantees provided, if any.

                               ing a query on a view (ViewExpandedText is used
                               instead).  ViewOriginalText  is  used for cases
                               like SHOW CREATE VIEW where users want  to  see
                               the original DDL command that created the view.

                            ViewExpandedText -> (string)

                               Engines may perform operations during view cre-
                               ation to transform ViewOriginalText to  ViewEx-
                               pandedText . For example:

                               o Fully  qualified  identifiers:  SELECT * from
                                 table1 -> SELECT * from db1.table1

                               in their respective query engines.

                 IsMultiDialectView -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  the view supports the SQL dialects of
                     one or more different query engines and can therefore  be

                                          may perform operations  during  view
