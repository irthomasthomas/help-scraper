       After calling the ListTriggers operation, you can call  this  operation
       to access the data to which you have been granted permissions. This op-
       eration supports all IAM permissions, including  permission  conditions
       that uses tags.

OPTIONS
       --trigger-names (list)
          A  list  of  trigger names, which may be the names returned from the
          ListTriggers operation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,

                 A   cron   expression  used  to  specify  the  schedule  (see
                 Time-Based Schedules for Jobs and Crawlers . For example,  to
                 run  something  every  day  at  12:15 UTC, you would specify:

                 (structure)

                     Arguments -> (map)
                        The job arguments used when this  trigger  fires.  For
                        this  job  run, they replace the default arguments set
                        in the job definition itself.

                        You can specify arguments here that your own  job-exe-
                        cution script consumes, as well as arguments that Glue
                        itself consumes.

                        For information about how to specify and consume  your
                        own Job arguments, see the Calling Glue APIs in Python
                        topic in the developer guide.

                        For information about the key-value  pairs  that  Glue
                        consumes  to  set up your job, see the Special Parame-
                        ters Used by Glue topic in the developer guide.

                        terminated and enters TIMEOUT status. The  default  is
                        2,880  minutes  (48 hours). This overrides the timeout
