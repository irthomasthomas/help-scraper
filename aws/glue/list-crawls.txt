LIST-CRAWLS()                                                    LIST-CRAWLS()



NAME
       list-crawls -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  all the crawls of a specified crawler. Returns only the crawls
       that have occurred since the launch date of the  crawler  history  fea-
       ture, and only retains up to 12 months of crawls. Older crawls will not
       be returned.

       You may use this API to:

       o Retrive all the crawls of a specified crawler.

       o Retrieve all the crawls of  a  specified  crawler  within  a  limited
         count.

       o Retrieve  all  the  crawls  of a specified crawler in a specific time
         range.

       o Retrieve all the crawls of a  specified  crawler  with  a  particular
         state, crawl ID, or DPU hour value.

SYNOPSIS
            list-crawls
          --crawler-name <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --crawler-name (string)
          The name of the crawler whose runs you want to retrieve.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return. The default is 20, and max-
          imum is 100.

       --filters (list)
          Filters the crawls by the criteria you specify in a list of  Crawls-
          Filter objects.

          (structure)
              A list of fields, comparators and value that you can use to fil-
              ter the crawler runs for a specified crawler.

              FieldName -> (string)
                 A key used  to  filter  the  crawler  runs  for  a  specified
                 crawler. Valid values for each of the field names are:

                 o CRAWL_ID  : A string representing the UUID identifier for a
                   crawl.

                 o STATE : A string representing the state of the crawl.

                 o START_TIME and END_TIME : The epoch timestamp in  millisec-
                   onds.

                 o DPU_HOUR  :  The number of data processing unit (DPU) hours
                   used for the crawl.

              FilterOperator -> (string)
                 A defined comparator that operates on the value.  The  avail-
                 able operators are:

                 o GT : Greater than.

                 o GE : Greater than or equal to.

                 o LT : Less than.

                 o LE : Less than or equal to.

                 o EQ : Equal to.

                 o NE : Not equal to.

              FieldValue -> (string)
                 The value provided for comparison on the crawl field.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FieldName=string,FilterOperator=string,FieldValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "FieldName": "CRAWL_ID"|"STATE"|"START_TIME"|"END_TIME"|"DPU_HOUR",
              "FilterOperator": "GT"|"GE"|"LT"|"LE"|"EQ"|"NE",
              "FieldValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --next-token (string)
          A continuation token, if this is a continuation call.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              CrawlId -> (string)

              Summary -> (string)
                 A  run  summary  for the specific crawl in JSON. Contains the
                 catalog tables and partitions that were  added,  updated,  or
                 deleted.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 If  an  error occurred, the error message associated with the

              DPUHour -> (double)
                 The number of data processing units (DPU) used in  hours  for
                 the crawl.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A continuation token for paginating the returned list of tokens, re-
          turned if the current segment of the list is not the last.
