DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  details  for the custom patterns specified by a list of
       names.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-get-custom-entity-types
          --names <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --names (list)
          A list of names of the custom patterns that you want to retrieve.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CustomEntityTypes -> (list)
          A  list of CustomEntityType objects representing the custom patterns
          that have been created.

          (structure)
              An object representing a custom pattern for detecting  sensitive
              data across the columns and rows of your structured data.

              Name -> (string)
                 A  name for the custom pattern that allows it to be retrieved
                 or deleted later. This name must be  unique  per  Amazon  Web
                 Services account.

              RegexString -> (string)
                 A regular expression string that is used for detecting sensi-
                 tive data in a custom pattern.

              ContextWords -> (list)
                 A list of context words. If none of these context  words  are
                 found  within the vicinity of the regular expression the data
                 will not be detected as sensitive data.

                 If no context words are passed only a regular  expression  is
                 checked.

                 (string)

       CustomEntityTypesNotFound -> (list)
          A list of the names of custom patterns that were not found.

          (string)
