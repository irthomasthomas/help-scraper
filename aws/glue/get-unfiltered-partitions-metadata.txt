OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The  ID of the Data Catalog where the partitions in question reside.
          If none is provided, the AWS account ID is used by default.

       --database-name (string)
          The name of the catalog database where the partitions reside.

       --table-name (string)
          The name of the table that contains the partition.

       --expression (string)
          An expression that filters the partitions to be returned.

          The expression uses SQL syntax  similar  to  the  SQL  WHERE  filter
          clause. The SQL statement parser JSQLParser parses the expression.
              Operators  : The following are the operators that you can use in
              the Expression API call:
                 =

          Checks whether the values of the two operands  are  equal;  if  yes,
          then the condition becomes true.

          Example: Assume 'variable a' holds 10 and 'variable b' holds 20.

          (a = b) is not true.
              < >

          Checks  whether  the values of two operands are equal; if the values
          are not equal, then the condition becomes true.

          Example: (a < > b) is true.
              >

          Checks whether the value of the left operand  is  greater  than  the
          value of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

          Example: (a > b) is not true.
              <

          Checks  whether the value of the left operand is less than the value
          of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

          Example: (a < b) is true.
              >=

          Checks whether the value of the left  operand  is  greater  than  or
          equal  to the value of the right operand; if yes, then the condition
          becomes true.

          Example: (a >= b) is not true.
              <=

          Checks whether the value of the left operand is less than  or  equal
          to  the  value  of the right operand; if yes, then the condition be-
          comes true.

          Example: (a <= b) is true.
              AND, OR, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, NOT, IS NULL

          Logical operators.

       the string will be taken literally.

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
