OPTIONS
       --integration-identifier (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the integration.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT

          The ARN of the source for the integration.

       TargetArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the target for the integration.

       IntegrationName -> (string)
          A unique name for an integration in Glue.

       Description -> (string)
          A description of the integration.

       IntegrationArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the integration.

       KmsKeyId -> (string)
          The ARN of a KMS key used for encrypting the channel.

       AdditionalEncryptionContext -> (map)
          An  optional  set  of  non-secret keyvalue pairs that contains addi-
          tional contextual information for encryption.

          key -> (string)

       Tags -> (list)
          Metadata assigned to the resource consisting of a list of  key-value
          pairs.

          (structure)
              The Tag object represents a label that you can assign to an Ama-
              zon Web Services resource. Each tag consists of a key and an op-
              tional value, both of which you define.

              For  more  information about tags, and controlling access to re-
              sources in Glue, see  Amazon  Web  Services  Tags  in  Glue  and

              key -> (string)
                 The  tag key. The key is required when you create a tag on an
                 object. The key is case-sensitive, and must not  contain  the
                 prefix aws.

              value -> (string)
                 The tag value. The value is optional when you create a tag on
                 an object. The value is case-sensitive, and must not  contain
                 the prefix aws.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the integration being deleted.

          The possible statuses are:

          o CREATING: The integration is being created.

          o ACTIVE: The integration creation succeeds.

          o MODIFYING: The integration is being modified.

          o FAILED: The integration creation fails.

          o DELETING: The integration is deleted.

          o SYNCING: The integration is synchronizing.

          o NEEDS_ATTENTION: The integration needs attention, such as synchro-
            nization.

       CreateTime -> (timestamp)
          The time when the integration was created, in UTC.
