MERGE-PROFILES()                                              MERGE-PROFILES()



NAME
       merge-profiles -

DESCRIPTION
       Runs an AWS Lambda job that does the following:

       o All  the  profileKeys  in  the ProfileToBeMerged will be moved to the
         main profile.

       o All the objects in the ProfileToBeMerged will be moved  to  the  main
         profile.

       o All the ProfileToBeMerged will be deleted at the end.

       o All  the profileKeys in the ProfileIdsToBeMerged will be moved to the
         main profile.

       o Standard fields are merged as follows:

         o Fields are always "union"-ed if there are no conflicts in  standard
           fields or attributeKeys.

         o When there are conflicting fields:

           o If no SourceProfileIds entry is specified, the main Profile value
             is always taken.

           o If a SourceProfileIds entry is specified, the specified profileId
             is always taken, even if it is a NULL value.

       You  can use MergeProfiles together with GetMatches , which returns po-
       tentially matching profiles, or use it  with  the  results  of  another
       matching  system. After profiles have been merged, they cannot be sepa-
       rated (unmerged).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not

       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
