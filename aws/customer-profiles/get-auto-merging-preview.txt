GET-AUTO-MERGING-PREVIEW()                          GET-AUTO-MERGING-PREVIEW()



NAME
       get-auto-merging-preview -

DESCRIPTION
       Tests the auto-merging settings of your Identity Resolution Job without
       merging your data. It randomly selects a sample of matching groups from
       the  existing  matching  results,  and applies the automerging settings
       that you provided. You can then view the number of profiles in the sam-
       ple, the number of matches, and the number of profiles identified to be
       merged. This enables you to evaluate the accuracy of the attributes  in
       your matching list.

       You can't view which profiles are matched and would be merged.

       WARNING:
          We  strongly  recommend  you use this API to do a dry run of the au-
          tomerging process before running the Identity  Resolution  Job.  In-
          clude  at  least  two matching attributes. If your matching list in-
          cludes too few attributes (such as only FirstName or  only  LastName
          ),  there  may  be  a  large  number  of matches. This increases the
          chances of erroneous merges.

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --consolidation (structure)
          A list of matching attributes that represent matching criteria.

          MatchingAttributesList -> (list)
              A list of matching criteria.

              (list)
                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MatchingAttributesList=[[string,string],[string,string]]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MatchingAttributesList": [
              ["string", ...]
              ...
            ]
          }

       --conflict-resolution (structure)
          How the auto-merging process should resolve conflicts  between  dif-
          ferent profiles.

          ConflictResolvingModel -> (string)
              How  the  auto-merging  process should resolve conflicts between
              different profiles.

              o RECENCY : Uses the data that was most recently updated.

              o SOURCE : Uses the data from a specific source. For example, if
                a  company  has  been  aquired or two departments have merged,
                data from the specified source is used. If two duplicate  pro-
                files are from the same source, then RECENCY is used again.

          SourceName -> (string)
              The ObjectType name that is used to resolve profile merging con-
              flicts when choosing SOURCE as the ConflictResolvingModel .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ConflictResolvingModel=string,SourceName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ConflictResolvingModel": "RECENCY"|"SOURCE",
            "SourceName": "string"
          }

       --min-allowed-confidence-score-for-merging (double)
          Minimum confidence score required for  profiles  within  a  matching
          group to be merged during the auto-merge process.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
