SYNOPSIS
            list-workflows
          --domain-name <value>
          [--workflow-type <value>]
          [--status <value>]
          [--query-start-date <value>]
          [--query-end-date <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --workflow-type (string)
          The  type  of workflow. The only supported value is APPFLOW_INTEGRA-
          TION.

          Possible values:

          o APPFLOW_INTEGRATION

       --status (string)
          Status of workflow execution.

          Possible values:

          o NOT_STARTED

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o COMPLETE

          o FAILED

          o SPLIT

          o RETRY

          o CANCELLED

       --query-start-date (timestamp)
          Retrieve workflows started after timestamp.

       --query-end-date (timestamp)
          Retrieve workflows ended after timestamp.

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
          previous  response  in  the next request to retrieve the next set of
          results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return per page.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
