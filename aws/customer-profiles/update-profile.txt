UPDATE-PROFILE()                                              UPDATE-PROFILE()



NAME
       update-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the properties of a profile. The ProfileId is required for up-
       dating a customer profile.

       When calling the UpdateProfile API, specifying an  empty  string  value
       means  that any existing value will be removed. Not specifying a string
       value means that any value already there will be kept.
