OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --object-type-name (string)
          The name of the profile object type.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ObjectTypeName -> (string)
          The name of the profile object type.

       Description -> (string)
          The description of the profile object type.

       TemplateId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the object template.

       ExpirationDays -> (integer)
          The number of days until the data in the object expires.

       EncryptionKey -> (string)
          The customer-provided key to encrypt the profile object that will be
          created in this profile object type.

       AllowProfileCreation -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether a profile should be created when data is  received
          if one doesnt exist for an object of this type. The default is FALSE
          . If the AllowProfileCreation flag is set to FALSE , then  the  ser-
          vice  tries  to  fetch  a standard profile and associate this object
          with the profile. If it is set to TRUE , and if no match  is  found,
          then the service creates a new standard profile.

       SourceLastUpdatedTimestampFormat -> (string)
          The  format  of  your sourceLastUpdatedTimestamp that was previously
          set up.

       MaxAvailableProfileObjectCount -> (integer)
          The amount of provisioned profile object max count available.

       MaxProfileObjectCount -> (integer)
          The amount of profile object max count assigned to the object type.

       Fields -> (map)
          A map of the name and ObjectType field.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents a field in a ProfileObjectType.

              Source -> (string)
                 A field of a ProfileObject. For  example:  _source.FirstName,
                 where  _source  is  a ProfileObjectType of a Zendesk user and
                 FirstName is a field in that ObjectType.

              Target -> (string)
                 The location of the data in the standard ProfileObject model.
                 For example: _profile.Address.PostalCode.

              ContentType -> (string)
                 The  content type of the field. Used for determining equality
                 when searching.

       Keys -> (map)
          A list of unique keys that can be used to map data to the profile.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (structure)
                 An object that defines the Key element of a ProfileObject.  A
                 Key  is  a  special  element that can be used to search for a
                 customer profile.

                 StandardIdentifiers -> (list)
                     The types of keys that a  ProfileObject  can  have.  Each
                     ProfileObject  can  have  only  1 UNIQUE key but multiple
                     PROFILE keys. PROFILE, ASSET, CASE, or ORDER  means  that
                     this  key  can be used to tie an object to a PROFILE, AS-
                     SET, CASE, or ORDER respectively. UNIQUE  means  that  it
                     can be used to uniquely identify an object. If a key a is
                     marked as SECONDARY, it will be used to search  for  pro-
                     files  after all other PROFILE keys have been searched. A
                     LOOKUP_ONLY key is only used to match a  profile  but  is
                     not  persisted to be used for searching of the profile. A
                     NEW_ONLY key is only used if the profile does not already
                     exist before the object is ingested, otherwise it is only
                     used for matching objects to profiles.

                     (string)

                 FieldNames -> (list)
                     The reference for the key name of the fields map.

                     (string)

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of when the domain was created.

       LastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of when the domain was most recently edited.

       Tags -> (map)
          The tags used to organize, track, or control  access  for  this  re-
          source.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
