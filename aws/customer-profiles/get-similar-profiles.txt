GET-SIMILAR-PROFILES()                                  GET-SIMILAR-PROFILES()



NAME
       get-similar-profiles -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a set of profiles that belong to the same matching group using
       the matchId or profileId . You can also specify the  type  of  matching
       that   you   want   for   finding   similar   profiles   using   either
       RULE_BASED_MATCHING or ML_BASED_MATCHING .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-similar-profiles is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: ProfileIds

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --match-type (string)
          Specify the type of matching to get similar profiles for.

          Possible values:

          o RULE_BASED_MATCHING

          o ML_BASED_MATCHING

       --search-key (string)
          The string indicating the search key to be used.

       --search-value (string)
          The string based on SearchKey to be searched for similar profiles.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ProfileIds -> (list)
          Set of profileId s that belong to the same matching group.

          (string)

       MatchId -> (string)
          The string matchId that the similar profiles belong to.

       MatchType -> (string)
          Specify the type of matching to get similar profiles for.

       RuleLevel -> (integer)
          The integer rule level that the profiles matched on.

       ConfidenceScore -> (double)
          It only has value when the MatchType is ML_BASED_MATCHING .A  number
          between 0 and 1, where a higher score means higher similarity. Exam-
          ining match confidence scores lets you distinguish between groups of
          similar  records  in which the system is highly confident (which you
          may decide to merge), groups of similar records about which the sys-
          tem is uncertain (which you may decide to have reviewed by a human),
          and groups of similar records that the system deems to  be  unlikely
          (which  you  may  decide to reject). Given confidence scores vary as
          per the data input, it should not be used as an absolute measure  of
          matching quality.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token from the previous GetSimilarProfiles API call.
