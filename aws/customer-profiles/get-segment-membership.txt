OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --segment-definition-name (string)
          The Id of the wanted segment. Needs to be a valid, and existing seg-
          ment Id.

       --profile-ids (list)
          The list of profile IDs to query for.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                     value -> (string)

                 FoundByItems -> (list)
                     A list of items used to find  a  profile  returned  in  a
                     SearchProfiles  response.  An item is a key-value(s) pair
                     that matches an attribute in the profile.

                     If the optional AdditionalSearchKeys  parameter  was  in-
                     cluded  in  the  SearchProfiles request, the FoundByItems
                     list should be interpreted based on  the  LogicalOperator
                     used in the request:

                     o AND  - The profile included in the response matched all
                       of the search keys specified in the request. The Found-
                       ByItems will include all of the key-value(s) pairs that
                       were specified in the request (as this is a requirement
                       of AND search logic).

                     o OR  -  The  profile included in the response matched at
                       least one of the search keys specified in the  request.
                       The  FoundByItems will include each of the key-value(s)
                       pairs that the profile was found by.

                     The OR relationship is the default behavior if  the  Log-
                     icalOperator   parameter   is   not   included   in   the
                     SearchProfiles request.

                     (structure)
                        A data type pair that consists of a KeyName and Values
                        list  that were used to find a profile returned in re-
                        sponse to a SearchProfiles request.

                        KeyName -> (string)
                            A searchable identifier of a customer profile.

                        Values -> (list)
                            A list of key values.

                            (string)

                 PartyTypeString -> (string)
                     An alternative to PartyType which accepts any  string  as
                     input.

                 GenderString -> (string)
                     An  alternative to Gender which accepts any string as in-
                     put.

       Failures -> (list)
          An array of maps where each contains a response per  profile  failed
          for the request.

          (structure)
              Object that holds failures for membership.

              ProfileId -> (string)
                 The profile id the failure belongs to.

              Message -> (string)
                 A message describing the failure.

              Status -> (integer)
                 The status describing the failure.
