OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --profile-ids (list)
          List of unique identifiers for customer profiles to retrieve.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

                 value -> (string)

              FoundByItems -> (list)
                 A  list  of  items  used  to  find  a  profile  returned in a
                 SearchProfiles response. An item is a key-value(s) pair  that
                 matches an attribute in the profile.

                 If  the  optional AdditionalSearchKeys parameter was included
                 in the SearchProfiles request, the FoundByItems  list  should
                 be  interpreted  based on the LogicalOperator used in the re-
                 quest:

                 o AND - The profile included in the response matched  all  of
                   the  search keys specified in the request. The FoundByItems
                   will include all of the key-value(s) pairs that were speci-
                   fied in the request (as this is a requirement of AND search
                   logic).

                 o OR - The profile included in the response matched at  least
                   one of the search keys specified in the request. The Found-
                   ByItems will include each of the  key-value(s)  pairs  that
                   the profile was found by.

                 The OR relationship is the default behavior if the LogicalOp-
                 erator parameter is not included in  the  SearchProfiles  re-
                 quest.

                 (structure)
                     A  data  type  pair that consists of a KeyName and Values
                     list that were used to find a  profile  returned  in  re-
                     sponse to a SearchProfiles request.

                     KeyName -> (string)
                        A searchable identifier of a customer profile.

                     Values -> (list)
                        A list of key values.

                        (string)

              PartyTypeString -> (string)
                 An  alternative  to PartyType which accepts any string as in-
                 put.

              GenderString -> (string)
                 An alternative to Gender which accepts any string as input.
