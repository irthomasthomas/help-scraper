UPDATE-DOMAIN()                                                UPDATE-DOMAIN()



NAME
       update-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  properties of a domain, including creating or selecting a
       dead letter queue or an encryption key.

       After a domain is created, the name cant be changed.

       Use this API or CreateDomain to enable identity resolution : set Match-
       ing to true.

       To  prevent  cross-service  impersonation  when  you call this API, see
       Cross-service confused deputy prevention for sample policies  that  you
       should apply.

       To  add  or  remove  tags  on  an  existing  Domain, see TagResource /-
       UntagResource .

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --default-expiration-days (integer)
          The default number of days until the data within the domain expires.

       --default-encryption-key (string)
          The default encryption key, which is an AWS  managed  key,  is  used
          when  no specific type of encryption key is specified. It is used to
          encrypt all data before it is placed in permanent or  semi-permanent
          storage. If specified as an empty string, it will clear any existing
          value.

       --dead-letter-queue-url (string)
          The URL of the SQS dead letter queue, which is  used  for  reporting
          errors associated with ingesting data from third party applications.
          If specified as an empty string, it will clear any  existing  value.
          You  must set up a policy on the DeadLetterQueue for the SendMessage
          operation to enable Amazon Connect Customer Profiles  to  send  mes-
          sages to the DeadLetterQueue.

       --matching (structure)
          The  process  of  matching  duplicate profiles. If Matching = true ,
          Amazon Connect Customer  Profiles  starts  a  weekly  batch  process
          called  Identity  Resolution  Job.  If you do not specify a date and
          time for Identity Resolution Job to run, by default  it  runs  every
          Saturday at 12AM UTC to detect duplicate profiles in your domains.

          After  the Identity Resolution Job completes, use the GetMatches API
          to return and review the results. Or, if you have configured Export-
          ingConfig in the MatchingRequest , you can download the results from
          S3.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              The flag that enables the matching  process  of  duplicate  pro-
              files.

          JobSchedule -> (structure)
              The  day and time when do you want to start the Identity Resolu-
              tion Job every week.

              DayOfTheWeek -> (string)
                 The day when the Identity Resolution  Job  should  run  every
                 week.

              Time -> (string)
                 The  time  when  the Identity Resolution Job should run every
                 week.

          AutoMerging -> (structure)
              Configuration information about the auto-merging process.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 The flag that enables the auto-merging of duplicate profiles.

              Consolidation -> (structure)
                 A list of matching attributes that represent matching  crite-
                 ria. If two profiles meet at least one of the requirements in
                 the matching attributes list, they will be merged.

                 MatchingAttributesList -> (list)
                     A list of matching criteria.

                     (list)
                        (string)

              ConflictResolution -> (structure)
                 How the auto-merging process should resolve conflicts between
                 different  profiles.  For example, if Profile A and Profile B
                 have the same FirstName and LastName (and that is the  match-
                 ing criteria), which EmailAddress should be used?

                 ConflictResolvingModel -> (string)
                     How the auto-merging process should resolve conflicts be-
                     tween different profiles.

                     o RECENCY : Uses the data that was most recently updated.

                     o SOURCE : Uses the data from a specific source. For  ex-
                       ample, if a company has been aquired or two departments
                       have merged, data from the specified source is used. If
                       two  duplicate  profiles are from the same source, then
                       RECENCY is used again.

                 SourceName -> (string)
                     The ObjectType name that is used to resolve profile merg-
                     ing conflicts when choosing SOURCE as the ConflictResolv-

                 A number between 0 and 1 that represents the  minimum  confi-
                 dence  score required for profiles within a matching group to
                 be merged during the auto-merge process. A higher score means
                 higher similarity required to merge profiles.

          ExportingConfig -> (structure)
              Configuration  information for exporting Identity Resolution re-
              sults, for example, to an S3 bucket.

              S3Exporting -> (structure)
                 The S3 location where Identity Resolution Jobs  write  result
                 files.

                 S3BucketName -> (string)
                     The  name of the S3 bucket where Identity Resolution Jobs
                     write result files.

                 S3KeyName -> (string)
                     The S3 key name of the location where Identity Resolution
                     Jobs write result files.

            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command

       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
