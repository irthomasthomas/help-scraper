GET-MATCHES()                                                    GET-MATCHES()



NAME
       get-matches -

DESCRIPTION
       Before  calling  this  API,  use CreateDomain or UpdateDomain to enable
       identity resolution: set Matching to true.

       GetMatches returns potentially matching profiles, based on the  results
       of the latest run of a machine learning process.

       WARNING:
          The  process  of  matching  duplicate profiles. If Matching = true ,
          Amazon Connect Customer  Profiles  starts  a  weekly  batch  process
          called  Identity  Resolution  Job.  If you do not specify a date and
          time for Identity Resolution Job to run, by default  it  runs  every
          Saturday at 12AM UTC to detect duplicate profiles in your domains.

          After  the Identity Resolution Job completes, use the GetMatches API
          to return and review the results. Or, if you have configured Export-
          ingConfig in the MatchingRequest , you can download the results from
          S3.

       Amazon Connect  uses  the  following  profile  attributes  to  identify
       matches:

       o PhoneNumber

       o HomePhoneNumber

       o BusinessPhoneNumber

       o MobilePhoneNumber

       o EmailAddress

       o PersonalEmailAddress

       o BusinessEmailAddress

       o FullName

       For  example,  two  or more profileswith spelling mistakes such as John
       Doe and  Jhn  Doe  ,  or  different  casing  email  addresses  such  as
       JOHN_DOE@ANYCOMPANY.COM and johndoe@anycompany.com , or different phone
       number formats such as 555-010-0000 and +1-555-010-0000 can be detected
       as  belonging  to  the same customer John Doe and merged into a unified
       profile.

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
          previous  response  in  the next request to retrieve the next set of
          results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return per page.

       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If there are additional results, this is the token for the next  set
          of results.

       MatchGenerationDate -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp this version of Match Result generated.

       PotentialMatches -> (integer)
          The number of potential matches found.

       Matches -> (list)
          The list of matched profiles for this instance.

          (structure)
              The Match group object.

              MatchId -> (string)
                 The unique identifiers for this group of profiles that match.

              ProfileIds -> (list)
                 A list of identifiers for profiles that match.

                 (string)

              ConfidenceScore -> (double)
                 A  number  between 0 and 1, where a higher score means higher
                 similarity. Examining match confidence scores lets  you  dis-
                 tinguish  between groups of similar records in which the sys-
                 tem is highly confident (which  you  may  decide  to  merge),
                 groups of similar records about which the system is uncertain
                 (which you may decide to  have  reviewed  by  a  human),  and
                 groups  of  similar  records  that the system deems to be un-
                 likely (which you may decide  to  reject).  Given  confidence
                 scores  vary  as per the data input, it should not be used an
                 absolute measure of matching quality.
