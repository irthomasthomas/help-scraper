OPTIONS
       --objects (list)
          A string that is serialized from a JSON object.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       DetectedProfileObjectTypes -> (list)
          Detected ProfileObjectType mappings from given objects. A maximum of
          one mapping is supported.

          (structure)
              Contains ProfileObjectType mapping information from the model.

              SourceLastUpdatedTimestampFormat -> (string)
                 The format of sourceLastUpdatedTimestamp that was detected in
                 fields.

              Fields -> (map)
                 A map of the name and the ObjectType field.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Represents a field in a ProfileObjectType.

                     Source -> (string)
                        A    field    of   a   ProfileObject.   For   example:
                        _source.FirstName, where _source is  a  ProfileObject-
                        Type  of  a  Zendesk  user and FirstName is a field in
                        that ObjectType.

                     Target -> (string)
                        The location of the data in the standard ProfileObject
                        model. For example: _profile.Address.PostalCode.

                     ContentType -> (string)
                        The  content  type  of the field. Used for determining
                        equality when searching.

              Keys -> (map)
                 A list of unique keys that can be used to map data to a  pro-
                 file.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (list)
                     (structure)
                        An object that defines the Key element of a ProfileOb-
                        ject. A Key is a special element that can be  used  to
                        search for a customer profile.

                        StandardIdentifiers -> (list)
                            The  types  of keys that a ProfileObject can have.
                            Each ProfileObject can have only 1 UNIQUE key  but
                            multiple  PROFILE  keys.  PROFILE, ASSET, CASE, or
                            ORDER means that this key can be used  to  tie  an
                            object to a PROFILE, ASSET, CASE, or ORDER respec-
                            tively. UNIQUE  means  that  it  can  be  used  to
                            uniquely  identify an object. If a key a is marked
                            as SECONDARY, it will be used to search  for  pro-
                            files  after  all  other  PROFILE  keys  have been
                            searched. A LOOKUP_ONLY key is only used to  match
                            a  profile  but  is  not  persisted to be used for
                            searching of the profile. A NEW_ONLY key  is  only
                            used  if the profile does not already exist before
                            the object is ingested, otherwise it is only  used
                            for matching objects to profiles.

                            (string)

                        FieldNames -> (list)
                            The reference for the key name of the fields map.

                            (string)
