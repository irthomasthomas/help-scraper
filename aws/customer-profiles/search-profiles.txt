SEARCH-PROFILES()                                            SEARCH-PROFILES()



NAME
       search-profiles -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches for profiles within a specific domain using one or more prede-
       fined search keys (e.g., _fullName,  _phone,  _email,  _account,  etc.)
       and/or  custom-defined  search  keys.  A search key is a data type pair
       that consists of a KeyName and Values list.

       This operation supports searching for profiles  with  a  minimum  of  1
       key-value(s) pair and up to 5 key-value(s) pairs using either AND or OR
       logic.

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token from the previous SearchProfiles API call.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of objects returned per page.

          The default is 20 if this parameter is not included in the request.

       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --key-name (string)
          A searchable identifier of a customer profile. The  predefined  keys
          you  can use to search include: _account, _profileId, _assetId, _ca-
          seId, _orderId, _fullName, _phone,  _email,  _ctrContactId,  _marke-
          toLeadId, _salesforceAccountId, _salesforceContactId, _salesforceAs-
          setId, _zendeskUserId, _zendeskExternalId, _zendeskTicketId, _servi-
          ceNowSystemId,  _serviceNowIncidentId,  _segmentUserId, _shopifyCus-
          tomerId, _shopifyOrderId.

       --values (list)
          A list of key values.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --additional-search-keys (list)
          A list of AdditionalSearchKey objects that are each searchable iden-
          tifiers  of  a  profile.  Each AdditionalSearchKey object contains a
          KeyName and a list of  Values  associated  with  that  specific  key
          (i.e.,  a  key-value(s)  pair). These additional search keys will be
          used in conjunction with the LogicalOperator and the  required  Key-
          Name  and  Values parameters to search for profiles that satisfy the
          search criteria.

          (structure)
              A data type pair that consists of a KeyName and Values list that
              is used in conjunction with the KeyName and Values parameters to
              search for profiles using the SearchProfiles API.

              KeyName -> (string)
                 A searchable identifier of a customer profile.

              Values -> (list)
                 A list of key values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "KeyName": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --logical-operator (string)
          Relationship between all specified search keys that will be used  to
          search  for  profiles. This includes the required KeyName and Values
          parameters as well as any key-value(s) pairs specified in the  Addi-
          tionalSearchKeys list.

          This parameter influences which profiles will be returned in the re-
          sponse in the following manner:

          o AND - The response only includes profiles that match  all  of  the
            search keys.

          o OR - The response includes profiles that match at least one of the
            search keys.

          The OR relationship is the default behavior if this parameter is not
          included in the request.

          Possible values:

          o AND

          o OR

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

              FoundByItems -> (list)
                 A  list  of  items  used  to  find  a  profile  returned in a
                 SearchProfiles response. An item is a key-value(s) pair  that
                 matches an attribute in the profile.

                 If  the  optional AdditionalSearchKeys parameter was included
                 in the SearchProfiles request, the FoundByItems  list  should
                 be  interpreted  based on the LogicalOperator used in the re-
                 quest:

                 o AND - The profile included in the response matched  all  of
                   the  search keys specified in the request. The FoundByItems
                   will include all of the key-value(s) pairs that were speci-
                   fied in the request (as this is a requirement of AND search
                   logic).

                 o OR - The profile included in the response matched at  least
                   one of the search keys specified in the request. The Found-
                   ByItems will include each of the  key-value(s)  pairs  that
                   the profile was found by.

                 The OR relationship is the default behavior if the LogicalOp-
                 erator parameter is not included in  the  SearchProfiles  re-
                 quest.

                 (structure)
                     A  data  type  pair that consists of a KeyName and Values
                     list that were used to find a  profile  returned  in  re-
                     sponse to a SearchProfiles request.

                     KeyName -> (string)
                        A searchable identifier of a customer profile.

                     Values -> (list)
                        A list of key values.

                        (string)

              PartyTypeString -> (string)
                 An  alternative  to PartyType which accepts any string as in-
                 put.

              GenderString -> (string)
                 An alternative to Gender which accepts any string as input.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token from the previous SearchProfiles API call.
