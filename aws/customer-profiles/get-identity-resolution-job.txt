OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --job-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the Identity Resolution Job.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

OUTPUT
       DomainName -> (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       JobId -> (string)
          The unique identifier of the Identity Resolution Job.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the Identity Resolution Job.

          o PENDING  :  The  Identity  Resolution Job is scheduled but has not
            started yet. If you turn off the Identity  Resolution  feature  in
            your domain, jobs in the PENDING state are deleted.

          o PREPROCESSING : The Identity Resolution Job is loading your data.

          o FIND_MATCHING  :  The Identity Resolution Job is using the machine
            learning model to identify profiles that belong to the same match-
            ing group.

          o MERGING  :  The  Identity Resolution Job is merging duplicate pro-
            files.

          o COMPLETED : The Identity Resolution Job completed successfully.

          o PARTIAL_SUCCESS : There's a system error and not all of  the  data
            is merged. The Identity Resolution Job writes a message indicating
            the source of the problem.

          o FAILED : The Identity Resolution Job did not merge  any  data.  It
            writes a message indicating the source of the problem.

       Message -> (string)
          The  error  messages that are generated when the Identity Resolution
          Job runs.

       JobStartTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of when the Identity Resolution  Job  was  started  or
          will be started.

       JobEndTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of when the Identity Resolution Job was completed.

       LastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The  timestamp of when the Identity Resolution Job was most recently
          edited.

       JobExpirationTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of when the Identity Resolution Job will expire.

       AutoMerging -> (structure)
          Configuration settings for how to perform the auto-merging  of  pro-
          files.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              The flag that enables the auto-merging of duplicate profiles.

          Consolidation -> (structure)
              A  list of matching attributes that represent matching criteria.
              If two profiles meet at least one of  the  requirements  in  the
              matching attributes list, they will be merged.

              MatchingAttributesList -> (list)
                 A list of matching criteria.

                 (list)
                     (string)

          ConflictResolution -> (structure)
              How  the  auto-merging  process should resolve conflicts between
              different profiles. For example, if Profile A and Profile B have
              the same FirstName and LastName (and that is the matching crite-
              ria), which EmailAddress should be used?

              ConflictResolvingModel -> (string)
                 How the auto-merging process should resolve conflicts between
                 different profiles.

                 o RECENCY : Uses the data that was most recently updated.

                 o SOURCE : Uses the data from a specific source. For example,
                   if a company has  been  aquired  or  two  departments  have
                   merged,  data from the specified source is used. If two du-
                   plicate profiles are from the same source, then RECENCY  is
                   used again.

              SourceName -> (string)
                 The  ObjectType  name that is used to resolve profile merging
                 conflicts when choosing SOURCE as the  ConflictResolvingModel
                 .

          MinAllowedConfidenceScoreForMerging -> (double)
              A  number between 0 and 1 that represents the minimum confidence
              score required for profiles within a matching group to be merged
              during the auto-merge process. A higher score means higher simi-
              larity required to merge profiles.

       ExportingLocation -> (structure)
          The S3 location where the  Identity  Resolution  Job  writes  result
          files.

                 The name of the S3 bucket name where Identity Resolution Jobs
                 write result files.

              S3KeyName -> (string)
                 The  S3  key  name  of the location where Identity Resolution
                 Jobs write result files.

       JobStats -> (structure)
          Statistics about the Identity Resolution Job.

          NumberOfProfilesReviewed -> (long)
