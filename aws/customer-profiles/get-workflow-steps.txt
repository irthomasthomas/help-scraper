NAME
       get-workflow-steps -

DESCRIPTION
       Get granular list of steps in workflow.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-workflow-steps
          --domain-name <value>
          --workflow-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --workflow-id (string)
          Unique identifier for the workflow.

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
          previous response in the next request to retrieve the  next  set  of
          results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return per page.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       WorkflowId -> (string)
          Unique identifier for the workflow.

       WorkflowType -> (string)
          The type of workflow. The only supported value  is  APPFLOW_INTEGRA-

                     Name of the flow created  during  execution  of  workflow
                     step.   APPFLOW_INTEGRATION   workflow  type  creates  an
                     appflow flow during workflow step execution on  the  cus-
                     tomers behalf.

                 Status -> (string)
                     Workflow step status for APPFLOW_INTEGRATION workflow.

                 ExecutionMessage -> (string)
                     Message   indicating   execution  of  workflow  step  for
                     APPFLOW_INTEGRATION workflow.

                 RecordsProcessed -> (long)
                     Total number of records  processed  during  execution  of
                     workflow step for APPFLOW_INTEGRATION workflow.

                 BatchRecordsStartTime -> (string)
                     Start  datetime  of records pulled in batch during execu-
                     tion of workflow step for APPFLOW_INTEGRATION workflow.

                 BatchRecordsEndTime -> (string)
                     End datetime of records pulled in batch during  execution
                     of workflow step for APPFLOW_INTEGRATION workflow.

                 CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                     Creation  timestamp of workflow step for APPFLOW_INTEGRA-
                     TION workflow.

                 LastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                     Last updated timestamp for workflow step for  APPFLOW_IN-
                     TEGRATION workflow.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  there are additional results, this is the token for the next set
          of results.
