CREATE-DOMAIN()                                                CREATE-DOMAIN()



NAME
       create-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  domain, which is a container for all customer data, such as
       customer profile attributes, object types, profile keys, and encryption
       keys.  You can create multiple domains, and each domain can have multi-
       ple third-party integrations.

       Each Amazon Connect instance can be associated with  only  one  domain.
       Multiple Amazon Connect instances can be associated with one domain.

       Use this API or UpdateDomain to enable identity resolution : set Match-
       ing to true.

       To prevent cross-service impersonation when  you  call  this  API,  see
       Cross-service  confused  deputy prevention for sample policies that you
       should apply.

       NOTE:
          It is not possible to associate a Customer Profiles domain  with  an
          Amazon  Connect Instance directly from the API. If you would like to
          create a domain and associate a Customer Profiles  domain,  use  the
          Amazon  Connect admin website. For more information, see Enable Cus-
          tomer Profiles .

          Each Amazon Connect instance can be associated with only one domain.
          Multiple Amazon Connect instances can be associated with one domain.

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --default-expiration-days (integer)
          The default number of days until the data within the domain expires.

       --default-encryption-key (string)
          The  default  encryption  key,  which is an AWS managed key, is used
          when no specific type of encryption key is specified. It is used  to
          encrypt  all data before it is placed in permanent or semi-permanent
          storage.

       --dead-letter-queue-url (string)
          The URL of the SQS dead letter queue, which is  used  for  reporting
          errors associated with ingesting data from third party applications.
          You must set up a policy on the DeadLetterQueue for the  SendMessage
          operation  to  enable  Amazon Connect Customer Profiles to send mes-
          sages to the DeadLetterQueue.

       --matching (structure)
          The process of matching duplicate profiles. If  Matching  =  true  ,
          Amazon  Connect  Customer  Profiles  starts  a  weekly batch process
          called Identity Resolution Job. If you do not  specify  a  date  and
          time  for  Identity  Resolution Job to run, by default it runs every
          Saturday at 12AM UTC to detect duplicate profiles in your domains.

          After the Identity Resolution Job completes, use the GetMatches  API
          to return and review the results. Or, if you have configured Export-
          ingConfig in the MatchingRequest , you can download the results from
          S3.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              The  flag  that  enables  the matching process of duplicate pro-
              files.

          JobSchedule -> (structure)
              The day and time when do you want to start the Identity  Resolu-
              tion Job every week.

              DayOfTheWeek -> (string)
                 The  day  when  the  Identity Resolution Job should run every
                 week.

              Time -> (string)
                 The time when the Identity Resolution Job  should  run  every
                 week.

          AutoMerging -> (structure)
              Configuration information about the auto-merging process.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 The flag that enables the auto-merging of duplicate profiles.

              Consolidation -> (structure)
                 A  list of matching attributes that represent matching crite-
                 ria. If two profiles meet at least one of the requirements in
                 the matching attributes list, they will be merged.

                 MatchingAttributesList -> (list)
                     A list of matching criteria.

                     (list)
                        (string)

              ConflictResolution -> (structure)
                 How the auto-merging process should resolve conflicts between
                 different profiles. For example, if Profile A and  Profile  B
                 have  the same FirstName and LastName (and that is the match-
                 ing criteria), which EmailAddress should be used?

                 ConflictResolvingModel -> (string)
                     How the auto-merging process should resolve conflicts be-
                     tween different profiles.

                     o RECENCY : Uses the data that was most recently updated.

                     o SOURCE  : Uses the data from a specific source. For ex-
                       ample, if a company has been aquired or two departments
                       have merged, data from the specified source is used. If
                       two duplicate profiles are from the same  source,  then
                       RECENCY is used again.

                 SourceName -> (string)
                     The ObjectType name that is used to resolve profile merg-
                     ing conflicts when choosing SOURCE as the ConflictResolv-
                     ingModel .

              MinAllowedConfidenceScoreForMerging -> (double)
                 A  number  between 0 and 1 that represents the minimum confi-
                 dence score required for profiles within a matching group  to
                 be merged during the auto-merge process. A higher score means
                 higher similarity required to merge profiles.

          ExportingConfig -> (structure)
              Configuration information for exporting Identity Resolution  re-
              sults, for example, to an S3 bucket.

              S3Exporting -> (structure)
                 The  S3  location where Identity Resolution Jobs write result
                 files.

                 S3BucketName -> (string)
                     The name of the S3 bucket where Identity Resolution  Jobs
                     write result files.

                 S3KeyName -> (string)
                     The S3 key name of the location where Identity Resolution
                     Jobs write result files.

          After the Identity Resolution Job completes, use the GetMatches  API
          to return and review the results. Or, if you have configured Export-
          ingConfig in the MatchingRequest , you can download the results from
          S3.

                 different profiles. For example, if Profile A and  Profile  B
                 have  the same FirstName and LastName (and that is the match-
                 ing criteria), which EmailAddress should be used?

                 ConflictResolvingModel -> (string)
                     How the auto-merging process should resolve conflicts be-
                     tween different profiles.

                 dence score required for profiles within a matching group  to
                 be merged during the auto-merge process. A higher score means
                 higher similarity required to merge profiles.

          ExportingConfig -> (structure)

          configuration  in  the  RuleBasedMatchingRequest  .  You can use the
          ListRuleBasedMatches and GetSimilarProfiles API to return and review
          the  results.  Also,  if  you have configured ExportingConfig in the
          RuleBasedMatchingRequest , you can download the results from S3.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
