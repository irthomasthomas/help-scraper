DESCRIPTION
       The  Amazon  Web Services Marketplace GetBuyerDashboard API enables you
       to get a procurement insights dashboard programmatically. The API  gets
       the  agreement  and  cost  analysis dashboards with data for all of the
       Amazon Web Services accounts in your Amazon Web Services Organization.

       To use the Amazon Web Services Marketplace Reporting API, you must com-
       plete the following prerequisites:

       o Enable  all features for your organization. For more information, see
         Enabling all features for an organization with Organizations , in the
         Organizations User Guide .

       o Call  the  service  as the Organizations management account or an ac-
         count registered as a delegated administrator for the procurement in-
         sights  service.  For more information about management accounts, see
         Tutorial: Creating and configuring an organization and  Managing  the
         management  account  with  Organizations  , both in the Organizations
         User Guide . For more information about delegated administrators, see
         Using  delegated  administrators , in the Amazon Web Services Market-
         place Buyer Guide .

       o Create an IAM policy that enables  the  aws-marketplace:GetBuyerDash-
         board  and  organizations:DescribeOrganization  permissions. In addi-
         tion, the management account requires the organizations:EnableAWSSer-
         viceAccess and iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole permissions to create. For
         more information about creating the policy, see Policies and  permis-
         sions in Identity and Access Management , in the IAM User Guide .

       NOTE:
          Access  can be shared only by registering the desired linked account
          as a delegated administrator. That requires  organizations:Register-
          DelegatedAdministrator     organizations:ListDelegatedAdministrators
          and organizations:DeregisterDelegatedAdministrator permissions.

       o Use the Amazon Web Services Marketplace console to create the AWSSer-
         viceRoleForProcurementInsightsPolicy  service-linked  role.  The role
         enables Amazon Web Services Marketplace procurement visibility  inte-
         gration. The management account requires an IAM policy with the orga-
         nizations:EnableAWSServiceAccess and iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole per-
         missions to create the service-linked role and enable the service ac-
         cess. For more information, see Granting access to Organizations  and
         Service-linked  role to share procurement data in the Amazon Web Ser-
         vices Marketplace Buyer Guide .

       o After creating the service-linked role, you must enable  trusted  ac-
         cess that grants Amazon Web Services Marketplace permission to access
         data from your Organizations. For more information, see Granting  ac-
         cess  to  Organizations  in the Amazon Web Services Marketplace Buyer
         Guide .
