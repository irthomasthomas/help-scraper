DESCRIPTION
       The AWS Marketplace GetBuyerDashboard API enables you to get a procure-
       ment insights dashboard programmatically. The API  gets  the  agreement
       and  cost  analysis dashboards with data for all of the Amazon Web Ser-
       vices accounts in your Amazon Web Services organization.

       To use the API, you must complete the following prerequisites:

       o Enable all features for your organization. For more information,  see
         Enabling  all  features  for an organization with Amazon Web Services
         Organizations , in the Amazon Web Services Organizations User Guide .

       o Call the service as the Amazon Web Services Organizations  management
         account or an account registered as a delegated administrator for the
         procurement insights service. Users without management  or  delegated
         administrator  accounts can use the dashboard, but they only see data
         for their accounts. For more information about  management  accounts,
         see  Tutorial:  Creating and configuring an organization and Managing
         the management account with Amazon Web Services Organizations ,  both
         in the Amazon Web Services Organizations User Guide . For more infor-
         mation about delegated administrators, see Using  delegated  adminis-
         trators , in the AWS Marketplace Buyer Guide .

       o Create  an  IAM policy that enables the aws-marketplace:GetBuyerDash-
         board and organizations:DescribeOrganization  permissions.  In  addi-
         tion, the management account requires the organizations:EnableAWSSer-
         viceAccess and iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole permissions to create  For
         more  information about creating the policy, see Policies and permis-
         sions in Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management , in  the
         IAM User Guide .

       o Use the Amazon Web Services Marketplace console to create the AWSSer-
         viceRoleForProcurementInsightsPolicy service-linked  role.  The  role
         enables  AWS Marketplace procurement visibility integration. The man-
         agement account requires an IAM  policy  with  the  organizations:En-
         ableAWSServiceAccess  and  iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole permissions to
         create the service-linked role and enable  the  service  access.  For
         more  information, see Granting access to Amazon Web Services Organi-
         zations , and Service-linked role to share procurement data , in  the
         Amazon Web Services Marketplace Buyer Guide .
