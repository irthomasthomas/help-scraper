OPTIONS
       --identifier (string)
          The  unique  identifier  of the requested resource. Valid values in-
          clude the name and ARN of the media insights pipeline configuration.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                        Specifies the name of the custom language model to use
                        when processing a transcription.  Note  that  language
                        model names are case sensitive.

                        The  language  of  the  specified  language model must
                        match the language code specified in the transcription
                        request. If the languages don't match, the custom lan-
                        guage model isn't applied. Language  mismatches  don't
                        generate errors or warnings.

                        the Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide .

                     EnablePartialResultsStabilization -> (boolean)
                        Enables partial result stabilization  for  your  tran-
                        scription. Partial result stabilization can reduce la-
                        tency in your output, but  may  impact  accuracy.  For
                        more  information, see Partial-result stabilization in
                        the Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide .

                     PartialResultsStability -> (string)
                        Specifies the level of stability to use when  you  en-
                        able  partial  results stabilization (EnablePartialRe-
                        sultsStabilization ).

                        Low stability provides the highest accuracy. High sta-
                        bility transcribes faster, but with slightly lower ac-
                        curacy.

                        For more information, see Partial-result stabilization
                        in the Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide .

                        Labels  all  personally identifiable information (PII)
                        identified in your transcript.

                        Content identification is  performed  at  the  segment
                        level; PII specified in PiiEntityTypes is flagged upon
                        complete transcription of an audio segment.

                        You  cant  set  ContentIdentificationType   and   Con-
                        tentRedactionType in the same request. If you do, your
                        request returns a BadRequestException .

                        Transcribe Developer Guide .

                     ContentRedactionType -> (string)
                        Redacts all personally identifiable information  (PII)
                        identified in your transcript.

                        Content  redaction  is performed at the segment level;
                        PII specified in PiiEntityTypes is redacted upon  com-
                        plete transcription of an audio segment.

                        You cant set ContentRedactionType and ContentIdentifi-
                        cationType in the same request. If you  do,  your  re-
                        quest returns a BadRequestException .

                        For  more  information,  see  Redacting or identifying
                        personally  identifiable  information  in  the  Amazon

                     VocabularyFilterMethod -> (string)
                        The vocabulary filtering method used in your Call Ana-
                        lytics transcription.

                     ShowSpeakerLabel -> (boolean)
                        Enables  speaker  partitioning  (diarization)  in your
                        transcription output. Speaker partitioning labels  the
                        speech from individual speakers in your media file.

                        For  more  information, see Partitioning speakers (di-
                        arization) in the Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide .

                     EnablePartialResultsStabilization -> (boolean)
                        Enables partial result stabilization  for  your  tran-
                        scription. Partial result stabilization can reduce la-
                        tency in your output, but may impact accuracy.

                        For more information, see Partial-result stabilization
                        in the Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide .

                     PartialResultsStability -> (string)
                        The  level of stability to use when you enable partial
                        results stabilization  (EnablePartialResultsStabiliza-
                        tion ).

                        Low stability provides the highest accuracy. High sta-
                        bility transcribes faster, but with slightly lower ac-
                        curacy.

                        For more information, see Partial-result stabilization
                        in the Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide .

                     ContentIdentificationType -> (string)
                        Labels all personally identifiable  information  (PII)
                        identified in your transcript.

                        Content  identification  is  performed  at the segment
                        level; PII specified in PiiEntityTypes is flagged upon
                        complete transcription of an audio segment.

                        You   cant   set  ContentIdentificationType  and  Con-
                        tentRedactionType in the  same  request.  If  you  set
                        both, your request returns a BadRequestException .

                     ContentRedactionType -> (string)
                        Redacts  all personally identifiable information (PII)
                        identified in your transcript.

                        Content redaction is performed at the  segment  level;
                        PII  specified in PiiEntityTypes is redacted upon com-
                        plete transcription of an audio segment.

                        You cant set ContentRedactionType and ContentIdentifi-
                        cationType  in the same request. If you set both, your
                        request returns a BadRequestException .

                        For more information,  see  Redacting  or  identifying
                        personally  identifiable  information  in  the  Amazon

                        The types of personally identifiable information (PII)
                        to  redact  from a transcript. You can include as many
                        types as you'd like, or you can select ALL .

                        To include PiiEntityTypes in your Call  Analytics  re-
                        quest, you must also include ContentIdentificationType
                        or ContentRedactionType , but you can't include both.

                        Values must be comma-separated and  can  include:  AD-
                        DRESS   ,   BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER   ,   BANK_ROUTING   ,
                        CREDIT_DEBIT_CVV     ,      CREDIT_DEBIT_EXPIRY      ,
                        CREDIT_DEBIT_NUMBER , EMAIL , NAME , PHONE , PIN , SSN
                        , or ALL .

                        If you leave this parameter empty, the default  behav-
                        ior is equivalent to ALL .

                        use when processing your transcription. Note that lan-
                        guage model names are case sensitive.

                        The  language  of  the  specified  language model must
                        match the language code you specify in your transcrip-
                        tion request. If the languages don't match, the custom
                        language model isn't applied. There are no  errors  or
                        warnings associated with a language mismatch.
