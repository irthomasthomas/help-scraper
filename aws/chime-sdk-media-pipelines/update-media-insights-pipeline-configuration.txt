                        Specifies the name of the custom language model to use
                        when processing a transcription.  Note  that  language
                        model names are case sensitive.

                        The  language  of  the  specified  language model must
                        match the language code specified in the transcription
                        request. If the languages don't match, the custom lan-
                        guage model isn't applied. Language  mismatches  don't
                        generate errors or warnings.

                        the Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide .

                     EnablePartialResultsStabilization -> (boolean)
                        Enables partial result stabilization  for  your  tran-
                        scription. Partial result stabilization can reduce la-
                        tency in your output, but  may  impact  accuracy.  For
                        more  information, see Partial-result stabilization in
                        the Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide .

                     PartialResultsStability -> (string)

                        sultsStabilization ).

                        Low stability provides the highest accuracy. High sta-
                        bility transcribes faster, but with slightly lower ac-
                        curacy.
