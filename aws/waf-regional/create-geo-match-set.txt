NAME
       create-geo-match-set -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Creates an  GeoMatchSet , which you use to specify which  web  requests
       you want to allow or block based on the country that the requests orig-
       inate from. For example, if you're receiving a lot of requests from one
       or more countries and you want to block the requests, you can create an
       GeoMatchSet that contains those countries and then configure AWS WAF to
       block the requests.

       To create and configure a GeoMatchSet , perform the following steps:

       o Use   GetChangeToken  to get the change token that you provide in the
         ChangeToken parameter of a CreateGeoMatchSet request.

       o Submit a CreateGeoMatchSet request.

       o Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you  provide  in  the
         ChangeToken parameter of an  UpdateGeoMatchSet request.

       o Submit  an UpdateGeoMatchSetSet request to specify the countries that
         you want AWS WAF to watch for.

       For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block
       HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A  friendly  name  or  description  of  the  GeoMatchSet . You can't
          change Name after you create the GeoMatchSet .

       --change-token (string)
          The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GeoMatchSet -> (structure)
          The  GeoMatchSet returned in the CreateGeoMatchSet response. The Ge-
          oMatchSet contains no GeoMatchConstraints .

          GeoMatchSetId -> (string)
              The  GeoMatchSetId for an GeoMatchSet . You use GeoMatchSetId to
              get information about a GeoMatchSet (see  GeoMatchSet ),  update
              a  GeoMatchSet  (see   UpdateGeoMatchSet ), insert a GeoMatchSet
              into a Rule or delete one from a Rule (see   UpdateRule  ),  and
              delete a GeoMatchSet from AWS WAF (see  DeleteGeoMatchSet ).
                 GeoMatchSetId is returned by  CreateGeoMatchSet and by  List-
                 GeoMatchSets .

          Name -> (string)
              A friendly name or description of the  GeoMatchSet .  You  can't
              change the name of an GeoMatchSet after you create it.

          GeoMatchConstraints -> (list)
              An array of  GeoMatchConstraint objects, which contain the coun-
              try that you want AWS WAF to search for.
