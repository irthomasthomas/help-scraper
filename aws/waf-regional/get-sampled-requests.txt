NAME
       get-sampled-requests -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Gets detailed information about a specified number of requests--a  sam-
       ple--that  AWS WAF randomly selects from among the first 5,000 requests
       that your AWS resource received during a time range  that  you  choose.
       You  can specify a sample size of up to 500 requests, and you can spec-
       ify any time range in the previous three hours.
          GetSampledRequests returns a time range, which is usually  the  time
          range  that  you  specified.  However,  if  your resource (such as a
          CloudFront distribution) received 5,000 requests before  the  speci-
          fied  time range elapsed, GetSampledRequests returns an updated time
          range. This new time range indicates the actual period during  which
          AWS WAF selected the requests in the sample.

OPTIONS
       --web-acl-id (string)
          The  WebACLId of the WebACL for which you want GetSampledRequests to
          return a sample of requests.

       --rule-id (string)
              RuleId is one of three values:

          o The RuleId of the Rule or the RuleGroupId  of  the  RuleGroup  for
            which you want GetSampledRequests to return a sample of requests.

          o Default_Action  , which causes GetSampledRequests to return a sam-
            ple of the requests that didn't match any  of  the  rules  in  the
            specified WebACL .

       --time-window (structure)
          The  start  date and time and the end date and time of the range for
          which you want GetSampledRequests to return a  sample  of  requests.
          You  must specify the times in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for-
          mat. UTC format includes the special designator, Z  .  For  example,
          "2016-09-27T14:50Z" . You can specify any time range in the previous
          three hours.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The beginning of the time range from which you  want  GetSample-
              dRequests  to  return a sample of the requests that your AWS re-
              source received. You must specify the date and time  in  Coordi-
              nated  Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the spe-
              cial designator, Z . For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z" . You  can
              specify any time range in the previous three hours.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The end of the time range from which you want GetSampledRequests
              to return a sample of the requests that your  AWS  resource  re-
              ceived.  You  must specify the date and time in Coordinated Uni-
              versal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the special desig-
              nator,  Z  .  For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z" . You can specify
              any time range in the previous three hours.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          StartTime=timestamp,EndTime=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "StartTime": timestamp,
            "EndTime": timestamp
          }

       --max-items (long)
          The number of requests that you want AWS WAF to  return  from  among
          the  first 5,000 requests that your AWS resource received during the
          time range. If your resource received fewer requests than the  value
          of  MaxItems  ,  GetSampledRequests returns information about all of
          them.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          (structure)

              NOTE:
                 This  is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and  see  the  AWS  WAF Developer Guide . With the latest
                     version, AWS WAF has a single set of  endpoints  for  re-
                     gional and global use.

              The  response from a  GetSampledRequests request includes a Sam-
              pledHTTPRequests complex type that appears as SampledRequests in
              the  response  syntax. SampledHTTPRequests contains one Sampled-
              HTTPRequest object for each web request that is returned by Get-
              SampledRequests .

              Request -> (structure)
                 A  complex  type that contains detailed information about the
                 request.

                 ClientIP -> (string)
                     The IP address that the request originated from.  If  the
                     WebACL is associated with a CloudFront distribution, this
                     is the value of one of the following fields in CloudFront
                     access logs:

                     o c-ip  ,  if  the  viewer did not use an HTTP proxy or a
                       load balancer to send the request

                     o x-forwarded-for , if the viewer did use an  HTTP  proxy
                       or a load balancer to send the request

                 Country -> (string)
                     The  two-letter country code for the country that the re-
                     quest originated from. For  a  current  list  of  country
                     codes, see the Wikipedia entry ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 .

                 URI -> (string)
                     The  part  of a web request that identifies the resource,
                     for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                 Method -> (string)
                     The HTTP method specified in  the  sampled  web  request.
                     CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE , GET ,
                     HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH , POST , and PUT .

                 HTTPVersion -> (string)
                     The HTTP version specified in the  sampled  web  request,
                     for example, HTTP/1.1 .

                 Headers -> (list)
                     A  complex  type that contains two values for each header
                     in the sampled web request: the name of  the  header  and
                     the value of the header.

                            This  is  AWS  WAF Classic documentation. For more
                            information, see AWS WAF Classic in the  developer
                            guide.
                               For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS
                               WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .
                               With  the  latest version, AWS WAF has a single
                               set of endpoints for regional and global use.

                        The response from a   GetSampledRequests  request  in-
                        cludes  an  HTTPHeader  complex  type  that appears as
                        Headers in the response  syntax.  HTTPHeader  contains
                        the names and values of all of the headers that appear
                        in one of the web requests that were returned by  Get-
                        SampledRequests .

                        Name -> (string)
                            The  name of one of the headers in the sampled web
                            request.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value of one of the headers in the sampled web
                            request.

              Weight -> (long)
                 A value that indicates how one result in the response relates
                 proportionally to other results in  the  response.  A  result
                 that  has  a  weight  of  2  represents roughly twice as many
                 CloudFront web requests as a result that has a weight of 1 .

              Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which AWS WAF received the request from your  AWS
                 resource, in Unix time format (in seconds).

              Action -> (string)
                 The  action  for  the  Rule that the request matched: ALLOW ,
                 BLOCK , or COUNT .

              RuleWithinRuleGroup -> (string)
                 This value is  returned  if  the  GetSampledRequests  request
                 specifies  the ID of a RuleGroup rather than the ID of an in-
                 dividual rule. RuleWithinRuleGroup is  the  rule  within  the
                 specified  RuleGroup  that  matched the request listed in the
                 response.

       PopulationSize -> (long)
          The total number of requests from  which  GetSampledRequests  got  a
          sample of MaxItems requests. If PopulationSize is less than MaxItems
          , the sample includes every request that your AWS resource  received
          during the specified time range.

       TimeWindow -> (structure)
          Usually, TimeWindow is the time range that you specified in the Get-
          SampledRequests request. However, if your AWS resource received more
          than  5,000 requests during the time range that you specified in the
          request, GetSampledRequests returns the time  range  for  the  first
          5,000  requests.  Times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for-
          mat.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The beginning of the time range from which you  want  GetSample-
              dRequests  to  return a sample of the requests that your AWS re-
              source received. You must specify the date and time  in  Coordi-
              nated  Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the spe-
              cial designator, Z . For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z" . You  can
              specify any time range in the previous three hours.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The end of the time range from which you want GetSampledRequests
              to return a sample of the requests that your  AWS  resource  re-
              ceived.  You  must specify the date and time in Coordinated Uni-
              versal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the special desig-
              nator,  Z  .  For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z" . You can specify
              any time range in the previous three hours.
