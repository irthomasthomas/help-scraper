OPTIONS
       --rule-group-id (string)
          The RuleGroupId of the  RuleGroup for which you want to get  a  list
          of  ActivatedRule objects.

       --next-marker (string)
          If  you  specify  a value for Limit and you have more ActivatedRules
          than the value of Limit , AWS WAF returns a NextMarker value in  the
          response  that  allows you to list another group of ActivatedRules .
          For the  second  and  subsequent  ListActivatedRulesInRuleGroup  re-
          quests,  specify  the value of NextMarker from the previous response
          to get information about another batch of ActivatedRules .

       --limit (integer)
          Specifies the number of ActivatedRules that you want AWS WAF to  re-
          turn for this request. If you have more ActivatedRules than the num-
          ber that you specify for Limit , the response includes a  NextMarker
          value that you can use to get another batch of ActivatedRules .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          If you have more ActivatedRules than the number that  you  specified
          for  Limit in the request, the response includes a NextMarker value.
          To list more ActivatedRules , submit  another  ListActivatedRulesIn-
          RuleGroup  request,  and  specify  the NextMarker value from the re-
          sponse in the NextMarker value in the next request.

       ActivatedRules -> (list)
          An array of ActivatedRules objects.

          (structure)

              NOTE:
                 This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide  .  With  the  latest
                     version,  AWS  WAF  has a single set of endpoints for re-
                     gional and global use.

              The ActivatedRule object in an  UpdateWebACL request specifies a
              Rule that you want to insert or delete, the priority of the Rule
              in the WebACL , and the action that you want  AWS  WAF  to  take
              when a web request matches the Rule (ALLOW , BLOCK , or COUNT ).

              To  specify  whether to insert or delete a Rule , use the Action
              parameter in the  WebACLUpdate data type.

              Priority -> (integer)
                 Specifies the order in which the Rules in a WebACL are evalu-
                 ated. Rules with a lower value for Priority are evaluated be-
                 fore Rules with a higher value. The value must  be  a  unique
                 integer.  If  you add multiple Rules to a WebACL , the values
                 don't need to be consecutive.

              RuleId -> (string)
                 The RuleId for a Rule . You use RuleId to get  more  informa-
                 tion  about  a  Rule (see  GetRule ), update a Rule (see  Up-
                 dateRule ), insert a Rule into a WebACL or delete a one  from
                 a  WebACL (see  UpdateWebACL ), or delete a Rule from AWS WAF
                 (see  DeleteRule ).
                     RuleId is returned by  CreateRule and by  ListRules .

              Action -> (structure)
                 Specifies the action that CloudFront or AWS WAF takes when  a
                 web request matches the conditions in the Rule . Valid values
                 for Action include the following:

                 o ALLOW : CloudFront responds with the requested object.

                 o BLOCK : CloudFront responds with an  HTTP  403  (Forbidden)
                   status code.

                 o COUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of requests that match
                   the conditions in the rule and then  continues  to  inspect
                   the  web  request  based  on the remaining rules in the web
                   ACL.
                     ActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only  when  updating
                     or  adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case, you do
                     not use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other  update  re-
                     quests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead of Activate-
                     dRule|OverrideAction .

                 Type -> (string)
                     Specifies how you want AWS WAF  to  respond  to  requests
                     that  match  the  settings in a Rule . Valid settings in-
                     clude the following:

                     o ALLOW : AWS WAF allows requests

                     o BLOCK : AWS WAF blocks requests

                     o COUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter  of  the  requests
                       that  match  all of the conditions in the rule. AWS WAF
                       then continues to inspect the web request based on  the
                       remaining rules in the web ACL. You can't specify COUNT
                       for the default action for a WebACL .

              OverrideAction -> (structure)
                 Use the OverrideAction to test your RuleGroup .

                 Any rule in a RuleGroup can potentially block a  request.  If
                 you set the OverrideAction to None , the RuleGroup will block
                 a request if any individual rule in the RuleGroup matches the
                 request  and  is configured to block that request. However if
                 you first want to test the RuleGroup , set the OverrideAction
                 to  Count . The RuleGroup will then override any block action
                 specified by individual rules contained within the group. In-
                 stead  of  blocking matching requests, those requests will be
                 counted. You can view a  record  of  counted  requests  using
                 GetSampledRequests .
                     ActivatedRule|OverrideAction  applies  only when updating
                     or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case  you  do
                     not  use  ActivatedRule|Action . For all other update re-
                     quests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead of Activate-
                     dRule|OverrideAction .

                 Type -> (string)
                     COUNT  overrides  the  action specified by the individual
                     rule within a RuleGroup . If set to NONE , the rule's ac-
                     tion will take place.

              Type -> (string)
                 The  rule  type,  either  REGULAR  ,  as  defined  by  Rule ,
                 RATE_BASED , as defined by  RateBasedRule , or GROUP , as de-
                 fined  by   RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR. Although this
                 field is optional,  be  aware  that  if  you  try  to  add  a
                 RATE_BASED  rule  to  a web ACL without setting the type, the
                 UpdateWebACL request will fail because the request  tries  to
                 add  a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which does not ex-
                 ist.

              ExcludedRules -> (list)
                 An array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This  is  ap-
                 plicable only when the ActivatedRule refers to a RuleGroup .

                 Sometimes  it  is  necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that
                 are blocking  traffic  unexpectedly  (false  positives).  One
                 troubleshooting  technique  is  to identify the specific rule
                 within the rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic
                 and  then disable (exclude) that particular rule. You can ex-
                 clude rules from both your own rule groups  and  AWS  Market-
                 place rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.

                 Specifying ExcludedRules does not remove those rules from the
                 rule group. Rather, it changes the action for  the  rules  to
                 COUNT  .  Therefore,  requests that match an ExcludedRule are
                 counted but not blocked. The  RuleGroup  owner  will  receive
                 COUNT metrics for each ExcludedRule .

                 If  you  want  to exclude rules from a rule group that is al-
                 ready associated with a web ACL, perform the following steps:

                 o Use the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules  that
                   you  want  to exclude. For more information about the logs,
                   see Logging Web ACL Traffic Information .

                 o Submit an  UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:

                   o The first action deletes the existing rule group from the
                     web ACL. That is, in the  UpdateWebACL request, the first
                     Updates:Action should  be  DELETE  and  Updates:Activate-
                     dRule:RuleId  should  be the rule group that contains the
                     rules that you want to exclude.

                   o The second action inserts the same rule  group  back  in,
                     but  specifying the rules to exclude. That is, the second
                     Updates:Action  should  be  INSERT  ,   Updates:Activate-
                     dRule:RuleId  should  be the rule group that you just re-
                     moved, and ExcludedRules should contain  the  rules  that
                     you want to exclude.

                     The rule to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable
                     only when the ActivatedRule refers to a RuleGroup  .  The
                     rule  must  belong  to the RuleGroup that is specified by
                     the ActivatedRule .

                     RuleId -> (string)
                        The unique identifier for the rule to exclude from the
                        rule group.
