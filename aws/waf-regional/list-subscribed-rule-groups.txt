OPTIONS
       --next-marker (string)
          If you specify a value for Limit and  you  have  more  ByteMatchSets
          subscribed  rule  groups than the value of Limit , AWS WAF returns a
          NextMarker value in the response that allows  you  to  list  another
          group of subscribed rule groups. For the second and subsequent List-
          SubscribedRuleGroupsRequest   requests,   specify   the   value   of
          NextMarker  from  the previous response to get information about an-
          other batch of subscribed rule groups.

       --limit (integer)
          Specifies the number of subscribed rule groups that you want AWS WAF
          to return for this request. If you have more objects than the number
          you specify for Limit , the response  includes  a  NextMarker  value
          that you can use to get another batch of objects.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o on

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          If  you  have  more  objects  than the number that you specified for
          Limit in the request, the response includes a NextMarker  value.  To
          list  more objects, submit another ListSubscribedRuleGroups request,
          and specify the NextMarker value from the response in the NextMarker
          value in the next request.

       RuleGroups -> (list)
          An array of  RuleGroup objects.
