NAME
       update-workspace-authentication -

DESCRIPTION
       Use  this  operation  to  define  the identity provider (IdP) that this
       workspace authenticates users from, using SAML. You can also  map  SAML
       assertion  attributes  to  workspace  user information and define which
       groups in the assertion attribute are to  have  the  Admin  and  Editor
       roles in the workspace.

       NOTE:
          Changes  to the authentication method for a workspace may take a few
          minutes to take effect.

OPTIONS
       --authentication-providers (list)
          Specifies whether this workspace uses SAML 2.0, IAM Identity Center,
          or both to authenticate users for using the Grafana console within a
          workspace. For more information, see User authentication  in  Amazon
          Managed Grafana .

       --saml-configuration (structure)
          If the workspace uses SAML, use this structure to map SAML assertion
          attributes to workspace user information and define which groups  in
          the  assertion  attribute  are to have the Admin and Editor roles in
          the workspace.

          allowedOrganizations -> (list)
              Lists which organizations defined in the SAML assertion are  al-
              lowed  to  use  the Amazon Managed Grafana workspace. If this is

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
