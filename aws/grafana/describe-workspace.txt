OPTIONS
       --workspace-id (string)
          The ID of the workspace to display information about.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

              This list is only used when the workspace  was  created  through
              the  Amazon Web Services console, and the permissionType is SER-
              VICE_MANAGED .

              (string)

                 ranges  of  IP  addresses. The IP addresses specified are al-
                 lowed to access your workspace. If the list is  not  included
                 in  the configuration then no IP addresses will be allowed to
                 access the workspace. You create a prefix list using the Ama-
                 zon VPC console.

                 Prefix list IDs have the format
                 ``

                        CIDR blocks using managed prefix lists in  the  Amazon
                        Virtual Private Cloud User Guide .

              vpceIds -> (list)
                 An  array  of  Amazon VPC endpoint IDs for the workspace. You
                 can create VPC  endpoints  to  your  Amazon  Managed  Grafana
                 workspace  for  access from within a VPC. If a NetworkAccess-
                 Configuration is specified then only VPC endpoints  specified
                 here will be allowed to access the workspace.

                 VPC endpoint IDs have the format
                 ``
                 vpce-1a2b3c4d `` .

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 378)
                        Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                        For  more  information about creating an interface VPC
                        endpoint, see Interface VPC endpoints  in  the  Amazon
                        Managed Grafana User Guide .

                        NOTE:
                     The only VPC endpoints that can be specified here are in-
                     terface VPC endpoints for Grafana workspaces  (using  the
                     com.amazonaws.[region].grafana-workspace   service   end-
                     point). Other VPC endpoints will be ignored.

                 (string)

          notificationDestinations -> (list)
              The Amazon Web Services notification channels that  Amazon  Man-
              aged  Grafana can automatically create IAM roles and permissions
              for, to allow Amazon Managed Grafana to use these channels.

              (string)

          organizationRoleName -> (string)
              The name of the IAM  role  that  is  used  to  access  resources
              through Organizations.

          organizationalUnits -> (list)
              Specifies  the  organizational  units that this workspace is al-
              lowed to use data sources from, if this workspace is in  an  ac-
              count that is part of an organization.

              (string)

          permissionType -> (string)
              If  this  is  SERVICE_MANAGED  ,  and  the workplace was created
              through the Amazon Managed Grafana console, then Amazon  Managed
              Grafana  automatically  creates the IAM roles and provisions the
              permissions that the workspace needs to use Amazon Web  Services
              data sources and notification channels.

              If  this  is  CUSTOMER_MANAGED , you must manage those roles and
              permissions yourself.

              If you are working with a workspace in a member  account  of  an
              organization  and  that account is not a delegated administrator
              account, and you want the workspace to access  data  sources  in
              other Amazon Web Services accounts in the organization, this pa-
              rameter must be set to CUSTOMER_MANAGED .

              For more information about converting between customer and  ser-
              vice  managed, see Managing permissions for data sources and no-
              tification channels . For more information about the  roles  and
              permissions   that   must   be   managed  for  customer  managed
              workspaces, see Amazon Managed Grafana permissions and  policies
              for Amazon Web Services data sources and notification channels

          stackSetName -> (string)
              The  name of the CloudFormation stack set that is used to gener-
              ate IAM roles to be used for this workspace.

          status -> (string)
              The current status of the workspace.

          tags -> (map)
              The list of tags associated with the workspace.
