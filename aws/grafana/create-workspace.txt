CREATE-WORKSPACE()                                          CREATE-WORKSPACE()



NAME
       create-workspace -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a workspace . In a workspace, you can create Grafana dashboards
       and visualizations to analyze your metrics, logs, and traces. You don't
       have  to  build,  package,  or  deploy  any hardware to run the Grafana
       server.

       Don't use CreateWorkspace to modify an existing workspace. Instead, use
       UpdateWorkspace .

OPTIONS
       --account-access-type (string)
          Specifies  whether  the workspace can access Amazon Web Services re-
          sources in this Amazon Web Services account only, or whether it  can
          also  access  Amazon Web Services resources in other accounts in the
          same organization. If you specify ORGANIZATION ,  you  must  specify
          which   organizational   units  the  workspace  can  access  in  the
          workspaceOrganizationalUnits parameter.

          Possible values:

          o CURRENT_ACCOUNT

          o ORGANIZATION

       --authentication-providers (list)
          Specifies whether this workspace uses SAML 2.0, IAM Identity  Center
          (successor to Single Sign-On), or both to authenticate users for us-
          ing the Grafana console within a workspace.  For  more  information,
          see User authentication in Amazon Managed Grafana .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            AWS_SSO
            SAML

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive,  user-provided  identifier to ensure the
          idempotency of the request.

       --configuration (string)
          The configuration string for the workspace that you create. For more
          information  about  the  format and configuration options available,
          see Working in your Grafana workspace .

       --organization-role-name (string)
          The name of an IAM role that already exists to  use  with  Organiza-
          tions  to  access  Amazon Web Services data sources and notification
          channels in other accounts in an organization.

       --permission-type (string)
          If you specify SERVICE_MANAGED on AWS Grafana console,  Amazon  Man-
          aged  Grafana automatically creates the IAM roles and provisions the
          permissions that the workspace needs to use Amazon Web Services data
          sources  and notification channels. In the CLI mode, the permission-
          Type SERVICE_MANAGED will not create the IAM role for you. The abil-
          ity  for the Amazon Managed Grafana to create the IAM role on behalf
          of the user is supported only in the Amazon Managed Grafana AWS con-
          sole.  Use only the CUSTOMER_MANAGED permission type when creating a
          workspace in the CLI.

          If you specify CUSTOMER_MANAGED , you will manage  those  roles  and
          permissions yourself. If you are creating this workspace in a member
          account of an organization that is not a delegated administrator ac-
          count,  and  you  want the workspace to access data sources in other
          Amazon Web Services accounts in the organization,  you  must  choose
          CUSTOMER_MANAGED .

          For  more  information,  see  Amazon Managed Grafana permissions and
          policies for Amazon Web Services data sources and notification chan-
          nels .

          Possible values:

          o CUSTOMER_MANAGED

          o SERVICE_MANAGED

       --stack-set-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  CloudFormation  stack set to use to generate IAM
          roles to be used for this workspace.

          The list of tags associated with the workspace.

          key -> (string)

            ...}

       --vpc-configuration (structure)
          The configuration settings for an  Amazon  VPC  that  contains  data
          sources for your Grafana workspace to connect to.

          securityGroupIds -> (list)
              The list of Amazon EC2 security group IDs attached to the Amazon
              VPC for your Grafana workspace to connect.

          subnetIds -> (list)
              The list of Amazon EC2 subnet IDs created in the Amazon VPC  for
              your Grafana workspace to connect.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          securityGroupIds=string,string,subnetIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "securityGroupIds": ["string", ...],
            "subnetIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --workspace-data-sources (list)
          Specify  the  Amazon  Web  Services data sources that you want to be
          queried in this workspace. Specifying these data  sources  here  en-
          ables  Amazon  Managed  Grafana  to create IAM roles and permissions
          that allow Amazon Managed Grafana to read data from  these  sources.
          You  must  still  add them as data sources in the Grafana console in
          the workspace.

          If you don't specify a data source here, you can still add it  as  a
          data  source  in the workspace console later. However, you will then
          have to manually configure permissions for it.

            REDSHIFT
            TWINMAKER

       --workspace-description (string)
          A description for the workspace. This is used only to help you iden-
          tify this workspace.

       --workspace-name (string)
          The name for the workspace. It does not have to be unique.

       --workspace-notification-destinations (list)
          Specify  the Amazon Web Services notification channels that you plan
          to use in this workspace. Specifying these data sources here enables
          Amazon  Managed Grafana to create IAM roles and permissions that al-
          low Amazon Managed Grafana to use these channels.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          The workspace needs an IAM role that grants permissions to the  Ama-
          zon  Web  Services resources that the workspace will view data from.
          If you already have a role that you want to use,  specify  it  here.
          The permission type should be set to CUSTOMER_MANAGED .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
