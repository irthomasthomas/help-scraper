CREATE-WORKSPACE()                                          CREATE-WORKSPACE()



NAME
       create-workspace -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a workspace . In a workspace, you can create Grafana dashboards
       and visualizations to analyze your metrics, logs, and traces. You don't
       have  to  build,  package,  or  deploy  any hardware to run the Grafana
       server.

       Don't use CreateWorkspace to modify an existing workspace. Instead, use
       UpdateWorkspace .

OPTIONS
       --account-access-type (string)
          Specifies  whether  the workspace can access Amazon Web Services re-
          sources in this Amazon Web Services account only, or whether it  can
          also  access  Amazon Web Services resources in other accounts in the
          same organization. If you specify ORGANIZATION ,  you  must  specify
          which   organizational   units  the  workspace  can  access  in  the
          workspaceOrganizationalUnits parameter.

          Possible values:

          o CURRENT_ACCOUNT

          o ORGANIZATION

       --authentication-providers (list)
          Specifies whether this workspace uses SAML 2.0, IAM Identity  Center
          (successor to Single Sign-On), or both to authenticate users for us-
          ing the Grafana console within a workspace.  For  more  information,
          see User authentication in Amazon Managed Grafana .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            AWS_SSO
            SAML

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive,  user-provided  identifier to ensure the
          idempotency of the request.

       --configuration (string)
          The configuration string for the workspace that you create. For more
          information  about  the  format and configuration options available,
          see Working in your Grafana workspace .

       --grafana-version (string)
          Specifies the version of Grafana to support in the new workspace.

          Supported values are 8.4 and 9.4 .

       --network-access-control (structure)
          Configuration for network access to your workspace.

          When this is configured, only listed IP addresses and VPC  endpoints
          will  be able to access your workspace. Standard Grafana authentica-
          tion and authorization will still be required.

          If this is not configured, or is removed, then all IP addresses  and
          VPC  endpoints  will be allowed. Standard Grafana authentication and
          authorization will still be required.

          prefixListIds -> (list)
              An array of prefix list IDs. A prefix list is  a  list  of  CIDR
              ranges  of  IP addresses. The IP addresses specified are allowed
              to access your workspace. If the list is  not  included  in  the
              configuration then no IP addresses will be allowed to access the
              workspace. You create a prefix list using the  Amazon  VPC  con-
              sole.

              Prefix list IDs have the format
              ``
              pl-1a2b3c4d `` .

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 169)
                     Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                     For  more  information about prefix lists, see Group CIDR
                     blocks using managed prefix lists in the  Amazon  Virtual
                     Private Cloud User Guide .

                     (string)

          vpceIds -> (list)
              An  array  of Amazon VPC endpoint IDs for the workspace. You can
              create VPC endpoints to your Amazon  Managed  Grafana  workspace
              for access from within a VPC. If a NetworkAccessConfiguration is
              specified then only VPC endpoints specified here will be allowed
              to access the workspace.

              VPC endpoint IDs have the format
              ``
              vpce-1a2b3c4d `` .

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 193)
                     Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                     For more information about creating an interface VPC end-
                     point, see Interface VPC endpoints in the Amazon  Managed
                     Grafana User Guide .

                     NOTE:
                 The  only VPC endpoints that can be specified here are inter-
                 face VPC endpoints for Grafana workspaces (using the com.ama-
                 zonaws.[region].grafana-workspace  service  endpoint).  Other
                 VPC endpoints will be ignored.

       --organization-role-name (string)
          The name of an IAM role that already exists to  use  with  Organiza-

       --permission-type (string)
          When creating a workspace through the Amazon Web Services  API,  CLI
          or Amazon Web Services CloudFormation, you must manage IAM roles and
          provision the permissions that the workspace needs to use Amazon Web
          Services data sources and notification channels.

          You  must  also  specify a workspaceRoleArn for a role that you will
          manage for the workspace to use when accessing those datasources and
          notification channels.

          The  ability  for  Amazon  Managed  Grafana to create and update IAM
          roles on behalf of the user is supported only in the Amazon  Managed
          Grafana console, where this value may be set to SERVICE_MANAGED .

          NOTE:
              Use  only  the  CUSTOMER_MANAGED permission type when creating a
              workspace with the API, CLI or Amazon Web  Services  CloudForma-
              tion.

       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument

                 Configuration  is specified then only VPC endpoints specified
                 here will be allowed to access the workspace.

                 VPC endpoint IDs have the format
                 ``

          organizationalUnits -> (list)
              Specifies the organizational units that this  workspace  is  al-
              lowed  to  use data sources from, if this workspace is in an ac-
              count that is part of an organization.

              (string)

          permissionType -> (string)
              If this is SERVICE_MANAGED  ,  and  the  workplace  was  created
              through  the Amazon Managed Grafana console, then Amazon Managed
              Grafana automatically creates the IAM roles and  provisions  the
              permissions  that the workspace needs to use Amazon Web Services
              data sources and notification channels.

              If this is CUSTOMER_MANAGED , you must manage  those  roles  and
              permissions yourself.

              If  you  are  working with a workspace in a member account of an
              organization and that account is not a  delegated  administrator
              account,  and  you  want the workspace to access data sources in
              other Amazon Web Services accounts in the organization, this pa-
              rameter must be set to CUSTOMER_MANAGED .

              vice managed, see Managing permissions for data sources and  no-
              tification  channels  . For more information about the roles and
              permissions  that  must  be   managed   for   customer   managed
              workspaces,  see Amazon Managed Grafana permissions and policies
              for Amazon Web Services data sources and notification channels
