NAME
       update-workspace -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  an existing Amazon Managed Grafana workspace. If you use this
       operation and omit any optional  parameters,  the  existing  values  of
       those parameters are not changed.

       To modify the user authentication methods that the workspace uses, such
       as SAML or IAM Identity Center, use UpdateWorkspaceAuthentication .

       To modify which users in  the  workspace  have  the  Admin  and  Editor
       Grafana roles, use UpdatePermissions .

OPTIONS
       --account-access-type (string)
          Specifies  whether  the workspace can access Amazon Web Services re-
          sources in this Amazon Web Services account only, or whether it  can
          also  access  Amazon Web Services resources in other accounts in the
          same organization. If you specify ORGANIZATION ,  you  must  specify
          which   organizational   units  the  workspace  can  access  in  the
          workspaceOrganizationalUnits parameter.

          Possible values:

          o CURRENT_ACCOUNT

          o ORGANIZATION

       --network-access-control (structure)
          The configuration settings for network access to your workspace.

          When this is configured, only listed IP addresses and VPC  endpoints
          will  be able to access your workspace. Standard Grafana authentica-
          tion and authorization will still be required.

          If this is not configured, or is removed, then all IP addresses  and
          VPC  endpoints  will be allowed. Standard Grafana authentication and
          authorization will still be required.

          prefixListIds -> (list)
              An array of prefix list IDs. A prefix list is  a  list  of  CIDR
              ranges  of  IP addresses. The IP addresses specified are allowed
              to access your workspace. If the list is  not  included  in  the
              configuration  (passed  an empty array) then no IP addresses are
              allowed to access the workspace. You create a prefix list  using
              the Amazon VPC console.

              Prefix list IDs have the format
              ``
              pl-1a2b3c4d `` .

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 119)
                     Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                     For  more  information about prefix lists, see Group CIDR
                     blocks using managed prefix lists in the  Amazon  Virtual
                     Private Cloud User Guide .

                     (string)

          vpceIds -> (list)
              An  array  of Amazon VPC endpoint IDs for the workspace. You can
              create VPC endpoints to your Amazon  Managed  Grafana  workspace
              for access from within a VPC. If a NetworkAccessConfiguration is
              specified then only VPC endpoints specified here are allowed  to
              access  the workspace. If you pass in an empty array of strings,
              then no VPCs are allowed to access the workspace.

              VPC endpoint IDs have the format
              ``
              vpce-1a2b3c4d `` .

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 143)
                     Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                     For more information about creating an interface VPC end-
                     point,  see Interface VPC endpoints in the Amazon Managed
                     Grafana User Guide .

                     NOTE:
                 The only VPC endpoints that can be specified here are  inter-
                 face VPC endpoints for Grafana workspaces (using the com.ama-
                 zonaws.[region].grafana-workspace  service  endpoint).  Other
                 VPC endpoints are ignored.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          prefixListIds=string,string,vpceIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "prefixListIds": ["string", ...],
            "vpceIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --organization-role-name (string)
          The  name  of  an  IAM role that already exists to use to access re-
          sources  through  Organizations.  This  can  only  be  used  with  a
          workspace that has the permissionType set to CUSTOMER_MANAGED .

       --permission-type (string)
          Use  this  parameter  if  you  want  to change a workspace from SER-
          VICE_MANAGED to CUSTOMER_MANAGED . This allows  you  to  manage  the
          permissions  that the workspace uses to access datasources and noti-
          fication channels. If the workspace is in a member Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices  account  of  an organization, and that account is not a dele-
          gated administrator account, and you want the  workspace  to  access
          data  sources in other Amazon Web Services accounts in the organiza-
          tion, you must choose CUSTOMER_MANAGED .

          If you specify this as CUSTOMER_MANAGED , you must  also  specify  a
          workspaceRoleArn  that  the  workspace will use for accessing Amazon
          Web Services resources.

          For more information on the role and permissions needed, see  Amazon
          Managed  Grafana  permissions  and  policies for Amazon Web Services
          data sources and notification channels

          NOTE:
              Do not use this to convert a CUSTOMER_MANAGED workspace to  SER-
              VICE_MANAGED  .  Do  not  include  this parameter if you want to
              leave the workspace as SERVICE_MANAGED .

              You can convert a CUSTOMER_MANAGED workspace to  SERVICE_MANAGED
              using  the Amazon Managed Grafana console. For more information,
              see Managing permissions for data sources and notification chan-
              nels .

          Possible values:

          o CUSTOMER_MANAGED

          o SERVICE_MANAGED

       --remove-network-access-configuration | --no-remove-network-access-con-
       figuration (boolean)
          Whether  to  remove  the  network  access  configuration  from   the
          workspace.

          Setting  this  to  true  and providing a networkAccessControl to set
          will return an error.

          If you remove this configuration by setting this to true , then  all
          IP addresses and VPC endpoints will be allowed. Standard Grafana au-
          thentication and authorization will still be required.

       --remove-vpc-configuration | --no-remove-vpc-configuration (boolean)
          Whether to remove the VPC configuration from the workspace.

          Setting this to true and providing a vpcConfiguration  to  set  will
          return an error.

       --stack-set-name (string)

                 workspace  for  access from within a VPC. If a NetworkAccess-
                 Configuration is specified then only VPC endpoints  specified
                 here  are  allowed to access the workspace. If you pass in an
                 empty array of strings, then no VPCs are  allowed  to  access
                 the workspace.

                 VPC endpoint IDs have the format
                 ``

              Specifies  the  organizational  units that this workspace is al-
              lowed to use data sources from, if this workspace is in  an  ac-

          permissionType -> (string)
              If  this  is  SERVICE_MANAGED  ,  and  the workplace was created
              through the Amazon Managed Grafana console, then Amazon  Managed
              Grafana  automatically  creates the IAM roles and provisions the
              permissions that the workspace needs to use Amazon Web  Services
              data sources and notification channels.

              If  this  is  CUSTOMER_MANAGED , you must manage those roles and
              permissions yourself.

              If you are working with a workspace in a member  account  of  an
              organization  and  that account is not a delegated administrator
              account, and you want the workspace to access  data  sources  in
              other Amazon Web Services accounts in the organization, this pa-
              rameter must be set to CUSTOMER_MANAGED .
