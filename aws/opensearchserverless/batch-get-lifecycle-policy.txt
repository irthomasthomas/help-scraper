BATCH-GET-LIFECYCLE-POLICY()                      BATCH-GET-LIFECYCLE-POLICY()



NAME
       batch-get-lifecycle-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  one  or  more configured OpenSearch Serverless lifecycle poli-
       cies. For more information, see Viewing data lifecycle policies .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       batch-get-lifecycle-policy uses document type  values.  Document  types
       follow  the  JSON  data model where valid values are: strings, numbers,
       booleans, null, arrays, and objects. For  command  input,  options  and
       nested  parameters that are labeled with the type document must be pro-
       vided as JSON. Shorthand syntax does not support document types.

OPTIONS
       --identifiers (list)
          The unique identifiers of policy types and policy names.

          (structure)
              The unique identifiers of policy types and policy names.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the lifecycle policy.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of lifecycle policy.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "type": "retention"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
