OPTIONS
       --resource-type (string)
          The type of the resource.

          o The resource type for health checks is healthcheck .

          o The resource type for hosted zones is hostedzone .

          Possible values:

          o healthcheck

          o hostedzone

       --resource-id (string)
          The ID of the resource for which you want to retrieve tags.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

                 Key -> (string)
                     The value of Key depends on the operation that  you  want
                     to perform:

                     o Add a tag to a health check or hosted zone : Key is the

                       to change the Value for.

                     o Delete  a  key : Key is the name of the tag you want to
                       remove.

                     o Give a name to a health check : Edit the  default  Name
                       tag.  In  the Amazon Route 53 console, the list of your
                       health checks includes a Name column that lets you  see

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of Value depends on the operation that you want
                     to perform:

                     o Add a tag to a health check or hosted zone :  Value  is
                       the value that you want to give the new tag.

                     o Edit  a  tag  : Value is the new value that you want to
                       assign the tag.
