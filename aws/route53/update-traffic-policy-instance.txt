NAME
       update-traffic-policy-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  resource record sets in a specified hosted zone that were
       created based on the settings in a specified traffic policy version.

       When you update a traffic policy instance, Amazon Route 53 continues to
       respond  to  DNS queries for the root resource record set name (such as
       example.com) while it replaces one group of resource record  sets  with
       another. Route 53 performs the following operations:

       o Route  53  creates  a  new group of resource record sets based on the
         specified traffic policy. This is true regardless of how  significant
         the differences are between the existing resource record sets and the
         new resource record sets.

       o When all of the new resource record sets have been created, Route  53
         starts  to  respond  to  DNS queries for the root resource record set
         name (such as example.com) by using the new resource record sets.

       o Route 53 deletes the old group of resource record sets that are asso-
         ciated with the root resource record set name.

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the traffic policy instance that you want to update.

       --ttl (long)
          The  TTL  that  you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to all of the up-
          dated resource record sets.

       --traffic-policy-id (string)
          The ID of the traffic policy that you want Amazon Route 53 to use to
          update  resource  record  sets  for the specified traffic policy in-
          stance.

       --traffic-policy-version (integer)
          The version of the traffic policy that you want Amazon Route  53  to
          use  to update resource record sets for the specified traffic policy
          instance.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
