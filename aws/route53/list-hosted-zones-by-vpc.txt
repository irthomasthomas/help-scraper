LIST-HOSTED-ZONES-BY-VPC()                          LIST-HOSTED-ZONES-BY-VPC()



NAME
       list-hosted-zones-by-vpc -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  the private hosted zones that a specified VPC is associated
       with, regardless of which Amazon Web Services  account  or  Amazon  Web
       Services  service  owns the hosted zones. The HostedZoneOwner structure
       in the response contains one of the following values:

       o An OwningAccount element, which contains the account number of either
         the  current  Amazon  Web Services account or another Amazon Web Ser-
         vices account. Some services, such as Cloud Map, create hosted  zones
         using the current account.

       o An  OwningService  element,  which identifies the Amazon Web Services
         service that created and owns the hosted  zone.  For  example,  if  a
         hosted  zone  was created by Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS),
         the value of Owner is efs.amazonaws.com .

       NOTE:
          When listing private hosted zones, the hosted zone  and  the  Amazon
          VPC  must  belong  to the same partition where the hosted zones were
          created. A partition is a group of Amazon Web Services Regions. Each
          Amazon Web Services account is scoped to one partition.

          The following are the supported partitions:

          o aws - Amazon Web Services Regions

          o aws-cn - China Regions

          o aws-us-gov - Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region

          For  more  information, see Access Management in the Amazon Web Ser-
          vices General Reference .

OPTIONS
       --vpc-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon VPC that you want to list hosted zones for.

       --vpc-region (string)
          For the Amazon VPC that you specified for VPCId  ,  the  Amazon  Web
          Services Region that you created the VPC in.

          Possible values:

          o us-east-1

          o us-east-2

          o us-west-1

          o cn-north-1

          o af-south-1

          o eu-south-1

       --max-items (string)
          (Optional)  The  maximum number of hosted zones that you want Amazon
          Route 53 to return. If the specified VPC  is  associated  with  more
          than  MaxItems  hosted zones, the response includes a NextToken ele-
          ment. NextToken contains an  encrypted  token  that  identifies  the
          first  hosted  zone  that Route 53 will return if you submit another
          request.

       --next-token (string)
          If the previous response included a NextToken element, the specified
          VPC  is associated with more hosted zones. To get more hosted zones,
          submit another ListHostedZonesByVPC request.

          For the value of NextToken , specify the value of NextToken from the
          previous response.

          If  the  previous response didn't include a NextToken element, there
          are no more hosted zones to get.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       HostedZoneSummaries -> (list)
          A  list  that contains one HostedZoneSummary element for each hosted
          zone that the specified Amazon VPC is associated with. Each  Hosted-
          ZoneSummary element contains the hosted zone name and ID, and infor-
          mation about who owns the hosted zone.

          (structure)
              In the response to a ListHostedZonesByVPC request,  the  Hosted-
              ZoneSummaries element contains one HostedZoneSummary element for
              each hosted zone that the specified  Amazon  VPC  is  associated
              with.  Each  HostedZoneSummary  element contains the hosted zone
              name and ID, and information about who owns the hosted zone.

              HostedZoneId -> (string)
                 The Route 53 hosted zone ID of a private hosted zone that the
                 specified VPC is associated with.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the private hosted zone, such as example.com .

              Owner -> (structure)
                 The  owner of a private hosted zone that the specified VPC is
                 associated with. The owner can be either an Amazon  Web  Ser-
                 vices account or an Amazon Web Services service.

                 OwningAccount -> (string)
                     If  the hosted zone was created by an Amazon Web Services
                     account, or was created by an Amazon Web Services service
                     that creates hosted zones using the current account, Own-
                     ingAccount contains the account ID of that  account.  For
                     example,  when you use Cloud Map to create a hosted zone,
                     Cloud Map creates the hosted zone using the current  Ama-
                     zon Web Services account.

                 OwningService -> (string)
                     If an Amazon Web Services service uses its own account to
                     create a hosted zone and associate the specified VPC with
                     that  hosted zone, OwningService contains an abbreviation
                     that identifies the service. For example, if Amazon Elas-
                     tic  File  System  (Amazon EFS) created a hosted zone and
                     associated a VPC with the hosted zone, the value of  Own-
                     ingService is efs.amazonaws.com .

       MaxItems -> (string)
          The  value  that  you  specified  for  MaxItems  in  the most recent
          ListHostedZonesByVPC request.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The value that you will use for NextToken in  the  next  ListHosted-
          ZonesByVPC request.
