LIST-GEO-LOCATIONS()                                      LIST-GEO-LOCATIONS()



NAME
       list-geo-locations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a list of supported geographic locations.

       Countries  are  listed first, and continents are listed last. If Amazon
       Route 53 supports subdivisions for a country (for  example,  states  or
       provinces),  the subdivisions for that country are listed in alphabeti-
       cal order immediately after the corresponding country.

       Route 53 does not perform authorization for this  API  because  it  re-
       trieves information that is already available to the public.

       For  a  list  of  supported geolocation codes, see the GeoLocation data
       type.

OPTIONS
       --start-continent-code (string)
          The code for the continent with which you want to start listing  lo-
          cations  that  Amazon Route 53 supports for geolocation. If Route 53
          has already returned a page or more of results,  if  IsTruncated  is
          true,  and  if  NextContinentCode  from  the previous response has a
          value, enter that value in startcontinentcode  to  return  the  next
          page of results.

          Include  startcontinentcode  only  if  you  want to list continents.
          Don't include startcontinentcode when you're  listing  countries  or
          countries with their subdivisions.

       --start-country-code (string)
          The  code for the country with which you want to start listing loca-
          tions that Amazon Route 53 supports for geolocation. If Route 53 has
          already returned a page or more of results, if IsTruncated is true ,
          and if NextCountryCode from the previous response has a value, enter
          that value in startcountrycode to return the next page of results.

       --start-subdivision-code (string)
          The  code  for the state of the United States with which you want to
          start listing locations that Amazon Route 53 supports  for  geoloca-
          tion. If Route 53 has already returned a page or more of results, if
          IsTruncated is true , and if NextSubdivisionCode from  the  previous
          response  has  a  value, enter that value in startsubdivisioncode to
          return the next page of results.

          To list subdivisions (U.S. states), you must include both startcoun-
          trycode and startsubdivisioncode .

       --max-items (string)
          (Optional)  The maximum number of geolocations to be included in the
          response body for this request. If more than  maxitems  geolocations
          remain  to  be  listed, then the value of the IsTruncated element in
          the response is true .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GeoLocationDetailsList -> (list)

          location that Amazon Route 53 supports for geolocation.

          (structure)
              A complex type that contains the codes and full continent, coun-
              try, and subdivision names for the specified geolocation code.

                 The two-letter code for the continent.

              ContinentName -> (string)
                 The full name of the continent.

              CountryCode -> (string)
                 The two-letter code for the country.

              CountryName -> (string)

              SubdivisionCode -> (string)
                 The  code  for  the  subdivision,  such as a particular state
