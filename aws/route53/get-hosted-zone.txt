OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the hosted zone that you want to get information about.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about a hosted zone

       The following get-hosted-zone command gets information about the hosted
       zone with an id of Z1R8UBAEXAMPLE:

          aws route53 get-hosted-zone --id Z1R8UBAEXAMPLE

OUTPUT
       HostedZone -> (structure)
          A complex type that contains general information about the specified
          hosted zone.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the hosted zone when you
              created it.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the domain. For public hosted  zones,  this  is  the
              name that you have registered with your DNS registrar.

              For information about how to specify characters other than a-z ,
              0-9 , and - (hyphen) and how to specify internationalized domain
              names, see CreateHostedZone .

          CallerReference -> (string)
              The  value  that you specified for CallerReference when you cre-
              ated the hosted zone.

          Config -> (structure)
              A complex type that includes the Comment  and  PrivateZone  ele-
              ments.  If you omitted the HostedZoneConfig and Comment elements
              from the request, the Config and Comment elements  don't  appear
              in the response.

              Comment -> (string)
                 Any comments that you want to include about the hosted zone.

              PrivateZone -> (boolean)
                 A value that indicates whether this is a private hosted zone.

          ResourceRecordSetCount -> (long)
              The number of resource record sets in the hosted zone.

          LinkedService -> (structure)
              If  the  hosted zone was created by another service, the service
              that created the hosted zone. When a hosted zone is  created  by
              another service, you can't edit or delete it using Route 53.

              ServicePrincipal -> (string)
                 If  the  health  check  or hosted zone was created by another
                 service, the service that created the resource.  When  a  re-
                 source  is  created  by  another  service,  you can't edit or
                 delete it using Amazon Route 53.

                 If the health check or hosted zone  was  created  by  another
                 service,  an optional description that can be provided by the
                 other service. When a resource is created by another service,
                 you can't edit or delete it using Amazon Route 53.

       DelegationSet -> (structure)

          specified hosted zone.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID that Amazon Route 53 assigns  to  a  reusable  delegation
              set.

              The  value  that you specified for CallerReference when you cre-
              ated the reusable delegation set.

          NameServers -> (list)
              A complex type that contains a list of  the  authoritative  name
              servers for a hosted zone or for a reusable delegation set.

              (string)

       VPCs -> (list)
          A complex type that contains information about the VPCs that are as-
          sociated with the specified hosted zone.

          (structure)
