OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the traffic policy.

       --document (string)
          The  definition  of this traffic policy in JSON format. For more in-
          formation, see Traffic Policy Document Format .

       --comment (string)
          (Optional) Any comments that you want to include about  the  traffic
          policy.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

              you created it.

          Version -> (integer)
              The version number that Amazon Route 53  assigns  to  a  traffic

              The name that you specified when you created the traffic policy.

          Type -> (string)
              The DNS type of the resource record sets that  Amazon  Route  53
              creates when you use a traffic policy to create a traffic policy
              instance.

          Document -> (string)
              The definition of a traffic policy in JSON format.  You  specify
              the JSON document to use for a new traffic policy in the Create-
              TrafficPolicy request. For more information about the JSON  for-
              mat, see Traffic Policy Document Format .

          Comment -> (string)
              The comment that you specify in the CreateTrafficPolicy request,
              if any.

       Location -> (string)
          A unique URL that represents a new traffic policy.
