NAME
       list-vpc-association-authorizations -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  list  of the VPCs that were created by other accounts and that
       can be associated with a specified hosted zone because you've submitted
       one or more CreateVPCAssociationAuthorization requests.

       The  response includes a VPCs element with a VPC child element for each
       VPC that can be associated with the hosted zone.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-vpc-association-authorizations is a paginated operation.  Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: VPCs

OPTIONS
       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          The ID of the hosted zone for which you want a list of VPCs that can
          be associated with the hosted zone.

       --max-results (string)
          Optional : An integer that specifies the maximum number of VPCs that
          you want Amazon Route 53 to return. If you don't specify a value for
          MaxResults , Route 53 returns up to 50 VPCs per page.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       HostedZoneId -> (string)
          The  ID  of  the  hosted zone that you can associate the listed VPCs
          with.

       NextToken -> (string)
          When the response includes a NextToken element, there are more  VPCs
          that  can  be  associated with the specified hosted zone. To get the
          next page of VPCs, submit  another  ListVPCAssociationAuthorizations
          request, and include the value of the NextToken element from the re-
          sponse in the nexttoken request parameter.

       VPCs -> (list)
          The list of VPCs that are authorized to be associated with the spec-
          ified hosted zone.

          (structure)
              (Private  hosted zones only) A complex type that contains infor-
              mation about an Amazon VPC.

              If you associate a private hosted zone with an Amazon  VPC  when
              you  make  a  CreateHostedZone request, the following parameters
              are also required.

              VPCRegion -> (string)
                 (Private hosted zones only) The region that an Amazon VPC was
                 created in.

              VPCId -> (string)
                 (Private hosted zones only) The ID of an Amazon VPC.
