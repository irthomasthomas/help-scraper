OPTIONS
       --health-check-id (string)
          The ID for the health check for which you want the last failure rea-
          son. When you created the health check,  CreateHealthCheck  returned
          the ID in the response, in the HealthCheckId element.

          NOTE:
              If  you  want  to  get  the last failure reason for a calculated
              health check, you must use the Amazon Route 53  console  or  the
              CloudWatch  console. You can't use GetHealthCheckLastFailureRea-
              son for a calculated health check.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)
