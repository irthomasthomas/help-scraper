OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          Specify  the value of Id of the traffic policy for which you want to
          list all versions.

       --traffic-policy-version-marker (string)
          For your first request to ListTrafficPolicyVersions , don't  include
          the TrafficPolicyVersionMarker parameter.

          If  you have more traffic policy versions than the value of MaxItems
          , ListTrafficPolicyVersions returns only the first group of MaxItems
          versions.  To get more traffic policy versions, submit another List-
          TrafficPolicyVersions request. For the  value  of  TrafficPolicyVer-
          sionMarker  , specify the value of TrafficPolicyVersionMarker in the
          previous response.

       --max-items (string)
          The maximum number of traffic policy versions that you  want  Amazon
          Route  53  to  include in the response body for this request. If the
          specified traffic policy has more than MaxItems versions, the  value
          of  IsTruncated in the response is true , and the value of the Traf-
          ficPolicyVersionMarker element is the ID of the first  version  that
          Route 53 will return if you submit another request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       TrafficPolicies -> (list)
          A list that contains one TrafficPolicy element for each traffic pol-
          icy version that is associated with the specified traffic policy.

          (structure)
              A complex type that contains settings for a traffic policy.

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID that Amazon Route 53 assigned to a traffic policy when
                 you created it.

              Version -> (integer)
                 The  version number that Amazon Route 53 assigns to a traffic
                 policy. For a new traffic policy, the value of Version is al-
                 ways 1.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name that you specified when you created the traffic pol-
                 icy.

              Type -> (string)
                 The DNS type of the resource record sets that Amazon Route 53
                 creates  when  you  use  a traffic policy to create a traffic
                 policy instance.

              Document -> (string)
                 The definition of a traffic policy in JSON format. You  spec-
                 ify  the JSON document to use for a new traffic policy in the
                 CreateTrafficPolicy request. For more information  about  the
                 JSON format, see Traffic Policy Document Format .

              Comment -> (string)
                 The  comment  that you specify in the CreateTrafficPolicy re-
                 quest, if any.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more traffic policies to  be
          listed. If the response was truncated, you can get the next group of
          traffic policies by submitting another ListTrafficPolicyVersions re-
          quest  and  specifying the value of NextMarker in the marker parame-
          ter.

       TrafficPolicyVersionMarker -> (string)
          If IsTruncated is true ,  the  value  of  TrafficPolicyVersionMarker
          identifies the first traffic policy that Amazon Route 53 will return
          if you submit another request. Call ListTrafficPolicyVersions  again
          and  specify  the  value  of TrafficPolicyVersionMarker in the Traf-
          ficPolicyVersionMarker request parameter.

          This element is present only if IsTruncated is true .

       MaxItems -> (string)
          The value that you specified for the maxitems parameter in the List-
          TrafficPolicyVersions request that produced the current response.
