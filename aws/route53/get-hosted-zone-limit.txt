OPTIONS
       --type (string)
          The limit that you want to get. Valid values include the following:

          o MAX_RRSETS_BY_ZONE  :  The  maximum number of records that you can
            create in the specified hosted zone.

          o MAX_VPCS_ASSOCIATED_BY_ZONE : The maximum number  of  Amazon  VPCs
            that you can associate with the specified private hosted zone.

          Possible values:

          o MAX_RRSETS_BY_ZONE

          o MAX_VPCS_ASSOCIATED_BY_ZONE

       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          The ID of the hosted zone that you want to get a limit for.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Limit -> (structure)
          The  current  setting  for  the specified limit. For example, if you
          specified MAX_RRSETS_BY_ZONE for the value of Type in  the  request,
          the  value  of  Limit  is the maximum number of records that you can
          create in the specified hosted zone.

          Type -> (string)
              The limit that you requested. Valid values include  the  follow-
              ing:

              o MAX_RRSETS_BY_ZONE  :  The  maximum number of records that you
                can create in the specified hosted zone.

              o MAX_VPCS_ASSOCIATED_BY_ZONE : The  maximum  number  of  Amazon
                VPCs  that you can associate with the specified private hosted
                zone.

          Value -> (long)
              The current value for the limit that is specified by Type .

       Count -> (long)
          The current number of entities that you have created of  the  speci-
          fied  type. For example, if you specified MAX_RRSETS_BY_ZONE for the
          value of Type in the request, the value of Count is the current num-
          ber of records that you have created in the specified hosted zone.
