TEST-DNS-ANSWER()                                            TEST-DNS-ANSWER()



NAME
       test-dns-answer -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  value  that Amazon Route 53 returns in response to a DNS re-
       quest for a specified record name and type. You can optionally  specify
       the  IP  address  of a DNS resolver, an EDNS0 client subnet IP address,
       and a subnet mask.

       This call only supports querying public hosted zones.

       NOTE:
          The TestDnsAnswer returns information similar to what you would  ex-
          pect  from  the answer section of the dig command. Therefore, if you
          query for the name servers of a subdomain that point to  the  parent
          name servers, those will not be returned.

OPTIONS
       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          The  ID of the hosted zone that you want Amazon Route 53 to simulate
          a query for.

       --record-name (string)
          The name of the resource record set that you want Amazon Route 53 to
          simulate a query for.

       --record-type (string)
          The type of the resource record set.

          Possible values:

          o SOA

          o A

          o TXT

          o NS

          o CNAME

          o MX

          o NAPTR

          o PTR

          o SRV

          o SPF

          o AAAA

          o CAA

          o DS

       --resolver-ip (string)
          If  you  want  to  simulate  a request from a specific DNS resolver,
          specify the IP address for that resolver. If you  omit  this  value,
          TestDnsAnswer  uses  the  IP address of a DNS resolver in the Amazon
          Web Services US East (N. Virginia) Region (us-east-1 ).

       --edns0-client-subnet-ip (string)
          If the resolver that you specified for  resolverip  supports  EDNS0,
          specify the IPv4 or IPv6 address of a client in the applicable loca-
          tion, for example, 192.0.2.44 or 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334 .

       --edns0-client-subnet-mask (string)
          If you specify an IP address for edns0clientsubnetip , you  can  op-
          tionally  specify the number of bits of the IP address that you want
          the checking tool to include in the DNS query. For example,  if  you
          specify    192.0.2.44    for    edns0clientsubnetip   and   24   for
          edns0clientsubnetmask , the checking tool will  simulate  a  request
          from  192.0.2.0/24.  The default value is 24 bits for IPv4 addresses
          and 64 bits for IPv6 addresses.

          The range of valid values depends on whether edns0clientsubnetip  is
          an IPv4 or an IPv6 address:

          o IPv4 : Specify a value between 0 and 32

          o IPv6 : Specify a value between 0 and 128

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Nameserver -> (string)
          The Amazon Route 53 name server used to respond to the request.

       RecordName -> (string)
          The name of the resource record set that  you  submitted  a  request
          for.

       RecordType -> (string)
          The  type  of  the  resource record set that you submitted a request
          for.

       RecordData -> (list)
          A list that contains values that Amazon Route 53 returned  for  this
          resource record set.

          (string)
              A  value  that Amazon Route 53 returned for this resource record
              set. A RecordDataEntry element is one of the following:

              o For non-alias resource record sets, a RecordDataEntry  element
                contains one value in the resource record set. If the resource
                record set contains multiple values, the response includes one
                RecordDataEntry element for each value.

              o For  multiple resource record sets that have the same name and
                type,  which  includes  weighted,  latency,  geolocation,  and
                failover,  a  RecordDataEntry  element contains the value from
                the appropriate resource record set based on the request.

              o For alias resource record sets that refer to Amazon  Web  Ser-
                vices  resources  other  than another resource record set, the
                RecordDataEntry element contains an IP  address  or  a  domain
                name  for  the  Amazon Web Services resource, depending on the
                type of resource.

              o For alias resource record sets that refer  to  other  resource
                record sets, a RecordDataEntry element contains one value from
                the referenced resource record set. If the referenced resource
                record set contains multiple values, the response includes one
                RecordDataEntry element for each value.

       ResponseCode -> (string)
          A code that indicates whether the request is valid or not. The  most
          common response code is NOERROR , meaning that the request is valid.
          If the response is not valid, Amazon Route  53  returns  a  response
          code  that  describes  the  error.  For  a list of possible response
          codes, see DNS RCODES on the IANA website.

       Protocol -> (string)
          The protocol that Amazon Route 53 used to respond  to  the  request,
          either UDP or TCP .
