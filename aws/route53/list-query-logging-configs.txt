LIST-QUERY-LOGGING-CONFIGS()                      LIST-QUERY-LOGGING-CONFIGS()



NAME
       list-query-logging-configs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the configurations for DNS query logging that are associated with
       the current Amazon Web Services account or the  configuration  that  is
       associated with a specified hosted zone.

       For more information about DNS query logs, see CreateQueryLoggingConfig
       . Additional information, including the format of DNS query  logs,  ap-
       pears in Logging DNS Queries in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-query-logging-configs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: QueryLoggingConfigs

OPTIONS
       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          (Optional) If you want to list the query logging configuration  that
          is associated with a hosted zone, specify the ID in HostedZoneId .

          If  you  don't specify a hosted zone ID, ListQueryLoggingConfigs re-
          turns all of the configurations that are associated with the current
          Amazon Web Services account.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (string)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list query logging configurations

       The  following  list-query-logging-configs  example  lists  information
       about  the  first 100 query logging configurations in your AWS account,
       for the hosted zone Z1OX3WQEXAMPLE.

          aws route53 list-query-logging-configs \
              --hosted-zone-id Z1OX3WQEXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "QueryLoggingConfigs": [
                  {
                      "Id": "964ff34e-ae03-4f06-80a2-9683cexample",
                      "HostedZoneId": "Z1OX3WQEXAMPLE",
                      "CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn": "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111122223333:log-group:/aws/route53/example.com:*"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       QueryLoggingConfigs -> (list)
          An  array that contains one QueryLoggingConfig element for each con-
          figuration for DNS query logging that is associated with the current
          Amazon Web Services account.

          (structure)
              A  complex  type that contains information about a configuration
              for DNS query logging.

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID for a configuration for DNS query logging.

              HostedZoneId -> (string)
                 The ID of the hosted zone that  CloudWatch  Logs  is  logging
                 queries for.

              CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the CloudWatch Logs log
                 group that Amazon Route 53 is publishing logs to.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If a response includes the last of the query logging  configurations
          that  are  associated  with the current Amazon Web Services account,
          NextToken doesn't appear in the response.

          If a response doesn't include the last of  the  configurations,  you
          can     get    more    configurations    by    submitting    another
          ListQueryLoggingConfigs request. Get the  value  of  NextToken  that
          Amazon  Route 53 returned in the previous response and include it in
          NextToken in the next request.
