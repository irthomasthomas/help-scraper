DELETE-TRAFFIC-POLICY()                                DELETE-TRAFFIC-POLICY()



NAME
       delete-traffic-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a traffic policy.

       When you delete a traffic policy, Route 53 sets a flag on the policy to
       indicate that it has  been  deleted.  However,  Route  53  never  fully
       deletes the traffic policy. Note the following:

       o Deleted traffic policies aren't listed if you run ListTrafficPolicies
         .

       o There's no way to get a list of deleted policies.

       o If you retain the ID of the policy, you can get information about the
         policy,   including   the   traffic   policy   document,  by  running
         GetTrafficPolicy .

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the traffic policy that you want to delete.

       --traffic-policy-version (integer)
          The version number of the traffic policy that you want to delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
