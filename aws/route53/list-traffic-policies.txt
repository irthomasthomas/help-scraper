OPTIONS
       --traffic-policy-id-marker (string)
          (Conditional) For your first request to ListTrafficPolicies ,  don't
          include the TrafficPolicyIdMarker parameter.

          If you have more traffic policies than the value of MaxItems , List-
          TrafficPolicies returns only the first MaxItems traffic policies. To
          get  the next group of policies, submit another request to ListTraf-
          ficPolicies . For the value of TrafficPolicyIdMarker ,  specify  the
          value of TrafficPolicyIdMarker that was returned in the previous re-
          sponse.

       --max-items (string)
          (Optional) The maximum number of traffic policies that you want Ama-
          zon Route 53 to return in response to this request. If you have more
          than MaxItems traffic policies, the value of IsTruncated in the  re-
          sponse is true , and the value of TrafficPolicyIdMarker is the ID of
          the first traffic policy that Route 53 will return if you submit an-
          other request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       o json

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

          count.

                 The name that you specified for the traffic policy  when  you
                 created it.

              Type -> (string)
                 The DNS type of the resource record sets that Amazon Route 53
                 creates when you use a traffic policy  to  create  a  traffic
                 policy instance.

              LatestVersion -> (integer)
                 The  version number of the latest version of the traffic pol-

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A  flag that indicates whether there are more traffic policies to be
          listed. If the response was truncated, you can get the next group of
          traffic  policies  by submitting another ListTrafficPolicies request
          and specifying the value of TrafficPolicyIdMarker in the TrafficPol-
          icyIdMarker request parameter.

       TrafficPolicyIdMarker -> (string)
          If  the  value of IsTruncated is true , TrafficPolicyIdMarker is the
          ID of the first traffic policy in the next group of MaxItems traffic
          policies.

       MaxItems -> (string)
          The value that you specified for the MaxItems parameter in the List-
          TrafficPolicies request that produced the current response.
