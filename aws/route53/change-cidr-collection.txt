CHANGE-CIDR-COLLECTION()                              CHANGE-CIDR-COLLECTION()



NAME
       change-cidr-collection -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates,  changes, or deletes CIDR blocks within a collection. Contains
       authoritative IP information mapping blocks to one  or  multiple  loca-
       tions.

       A  change  request  can  update multiple locations in a collection at a
       time, which is helpful if you want to move one or more CIDR blocks from
       one location to another in one transaction, without downtime.
          Limits

       The max number of CIDR blocks included in the request is 1000. As a re-
       sult, big updates require multiple API calls.
          PUT and DELETE_IF_EXISTS

       Use ChangeCidrCollection to perform the following actions:

       o PUT : Create a CIDR block within the specified collection.

       o DELETE_IF_EXISTS : Delete an existing CIDR block from the collection.

SYNOPSIS
            change-cidr-collection
          --id <value>
          [--collection-version <value>]
          --changes <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The UUID of the CIDR collection to update.

       --collection-version (long)
          A sequential counter that Amazon Route 53 sets to 1 when you  create
          a collection and increments it by 1 each time you update the collec-
          tion.

          We recommend that you use  ListCidrCollection  to  get  the  current
          value  of  CollectionVersion for the collection that you want to up-
          date, and then include that value with the change request. This pre-
          vents Route 53 from overwriting an intervening update:

          o If the value in the request matches the value of CollectionVersion
            in the collection, Route 53 updates the collection.

          o If the value of CollectionVersion in  the  collection  is  greater
            than  the  value  in the request, the collection was changed after
            you got the version number. Route 53 does not update  the  collec-
            tion, and it returns a CidrCollectionVersionMismatch error.

       --changes (list)
          Information about changes to a CIDR collection.

          (structure)
              A  complex type that contains information about the CIDR collec-
              tion change.

              LocationName -> (string)
                 Name of the location that is associated with the CIDR collec-
                 tion.

              Action -> (string)
                 CIDR collection change action.

              CidrList -> (list)
                 List of CIDR blocks.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          LocationName=string,Action=string,CidrList=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "LocationName": "string",
              "Action": "PUT"|"DELETE_IF_EXISTS",
              "CidrList": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Id -> (string)
          The ID that is returned by ChangeCidrCollection . You can use it  as
          input to GetChange to see if a CIDR collection change has propagated
          or not.
