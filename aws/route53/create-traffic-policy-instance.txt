NAME
       create-traffic-policy-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  resource  record  sets in a specified hosted zone based on the
       settings in a specified traffic policy version.  In  addition,  Create-
       TrafficPolicyInstance associates the resource record sets with a speci-
       fied domain name (such as  example.com)  or  subdomain  name  (such  as
       www.example.com).  Amazon  Route 53 responds to DNS queries for the do-
       main or subdomain name by using the resource record sets  that  Create-
       TrafficPolicyInstance created.

OPTIONS
       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the hosted zone that you want Amazon Route 53 to create
          resource record sets in by using the configuration in a traffic pol-
          icy.

       --name (string)
          The  domain  name  (such  as example.com) or subdomain name (such as
          www.example.com) for which Amazon Route 53 responds to  DNS  queries
          by  using  the  resource  record sets that Route 53 creates for this
          traffic policy instance.

       --ttl (long)
          (Optional) The TTL that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to all of
          the  resource  record  sets  that it creates in the specified hosted
          zone.

       --traffic-policy-id (string)
          The ID of the traffic policy that you want to use to create resource
          record sets in the specified hosted zone.

       --traffic-policy-version (integer)
          The version of the traffic policy that you want to use to create re-
          source record sets in the specified hosted zone.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
