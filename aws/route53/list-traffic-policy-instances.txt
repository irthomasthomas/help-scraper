LIST-TRAFFIC-POLICY-INSTANCES()                LIST-TRAFFIC-POLICY-INSTANCES()



NAME
       list-traffic-policy-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about the traffic policy instances that you created by
       using the current Amazon Web Services account.

       NOTE:
          After you submit an UpdateTrafficPolicyInstance request,  there's  a
          brief  delay  while Amazon Route 53 creates the resource record sets
          that are specified in the traffic policy definition. For more infor-
          mation, see the State response element.

       Route 53 returns a maximum of 100 items in each response. If you have a
       lot of traffic policy instances, you can use the MaxItems parameter  to
       list them in groups of up to 100.

OPTIONS
       --hosted-zone-id-marker (string)
          If  the value of IsTruncated in the previous response was true , you
          have more traffic policy instances. To get more traffic  policy  in-
          stances,  submit another ListTrafficPolicyInstances request. For the
          value of HostedZoneId , specify the value of HostedZoneIdMarker from
          the  previous  response,  which  is  the hosted zone ID of the first
          traffic policy instance in the next  group  of  traffic  policy  in-
          stances.

          If  the  value  of  IsTruncated in the previous response was false ,
          there are no more traffic policy instances to get.

       --traffic-policy-instance-name-marker (string)
          If the value of IsTruncated in the previous response was true ,  you
          have  more  traffic policy instances. To get more traffic policy in-
          stances, submit another ListTrafficPolicyInstances request. For  the
          value  of  trafficpolicyinstancename  ,  specify  the value of Traf-
          ficPolicyInstanceNameMarker from the previous response, which is the
          name of the first traffic policy instance in the next group of traf-
          fic policy instances.

          If the value of IsTruncated in the previous  response  was  false  ,
          there are no more traffic policy instances to get.

       --traffic-policy-instance-type-marker (string)
          If  the value of IsTruncated in the previous response was true , you
          have more traffic policy instances. To get more traffic  policy  in-
          stances,  submit another ListTrafficPolicyInstances request. For the
          value of trafficpolicyinstancetype ,  specify  the  value  of  Traf-
          ficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker from the previous response, which is the
          type of the first traffic policy instance in the next group of traf-
          fic policy instances.

          If  the  value  of  IsTruncated in the previous response was false ,
          there are no more traffic policy instances to get.

       --max-items (string)
          The maximum number of traffic policy instances that you want  Amazon
          Route  53  to return in response to a ListTrafficPolicyInstances re-
          quest. If you have more than MaxItems traffic policy instances,  the
          value  of  the IsTruncated element in the response is true , and the
          values of HostedZoneIdMarker , TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker , and
          TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker  represent  the first traffic policy
          instance in the next group of MaxItems traffic policy instances.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
