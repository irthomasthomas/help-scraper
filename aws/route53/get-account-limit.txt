OPTIONS
       --type (string)
          The limit that you want to get. Valid values include the following:

          o MAX_HEALTH_CHECKS_BY_OWNER  :  The maximum number of health checks
            that you can create using the current account.

          o MAX_HOSTED_ZONES_BY_OWNER : The maximum  number  of  hosted  zones
            that you can create using the current account.

          o MAX_REUSABLE_DELEGATION_SETS_BY_OWNER  : The maximum number of re-
            usable delegation sets that you can create using the  current  ac-
            count.

          o MAX_TRAFFIC_POLICIES_BY_OWNER  :  The  maximum  number  of traffic
            policies that you can create using the current account.

          o MAX_TRAFFIC_POLICY_INSTANCES_BY_OWNER  :  The  maximum  number  of
            traffic policy instances that you can create using the current ac-
            count. (Traffic policy instances are referred to as  traffic  flow
            policy records in the Amazon Route 53 console.)

          Possible values:

          o MAX_HEALTH_CHECKS_BY_OWNER

          o MAX_HOSTED_ZONES_BY_OWNER

          o MAX_TRAFFIC_POLICY_INSTANCES_BY_OWNER

          o MAX_TRAFFIC_POLICIES_BY_OWNER

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

OUTPUT
       Limit -> (structure)
          The current setting for the specified limit.  For  example,  if  you
          specified  MAX_HEALTH_CHECKS_BY_OWNER  for  the value of Type in the
          request, the value of Limit is the maximum number of  health  checks
          that you can create using the current account.

          Type -> (string)
              The  limit  that you requested. Valid values include the follow-
              ing:

              o MAX_HEALTH_CHECKS_BY_OWNER :  The  maximum  number  of  health
                checks that you can create using the current account.

              o MAX_HOSTED_ZONES_BY_OWNER : The maximum number of hosted zones
                that you can create using the current account.

              o MAX_REUSABLE_DELEGATION_SETS_BY_OWNER : The maximum number  of
                reusable delegation sets that you can create using the current
                account.

              o MAX_TRAFFIC_POLICIES_BY_OWNER : The maximum number of  traffic
                policies that you can create using the current account.

              o MAX_TRAFFIC_POLICY_INSTANCES_BY_OWNER  : The maximum number of
                traffic policy instances that you can create using the current
                account.  (Traffic policy instances are referred to as traffic
                flow policy records in the Amazon Route 53 console.)

          Value -> (long)
              The current value for the limit that is specified by Type .

       Count -> (long)
          The current number of entities that you have created of  the  speci-
          fied  type. For example, if you specified MAX_HEALTH_CHECKS_BY_OWNER
          for the value of Type in the request, the value of Count is the cur-
          rent number of health checks that you have created using the current
          account.
