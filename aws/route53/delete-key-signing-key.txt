DELETE-KEY-SIGNING-KEY()                              DELETE-KEY-SIGNING-KEY()



NAME
       delete-key-signing-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a key-signing key (KSK). Before you can delete a KSK, you must
       deactivate it. The KSK must be deactivated before you can delete it re-
       gardless of whether the hosted zone is enabled for DNSSEC signing.

       You  can  use  DeactivateKeySigningKey to deactivate the key before you
       delete it.

       Use GetDNSSEC to verify that the KSK is in an INACTIVE status.

OPTIONS
       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          A unique string used to identify a hosted zone.

       --name (string)
          A string used to identify a key-signing key (KSK).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.

OUTPUT
       ChangeInfo -> (structure)

          Id -> (string)
              This element contains an ID  that  you  use  when  performing  a
