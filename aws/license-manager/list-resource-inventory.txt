LIST-RESOURCE-INVENTORY()                            LIST-RESOURCE-INVENTORY()



NAME
       list-resource-inventory -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists resources managed using Systems Manager inventory.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-resource-inventory  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: ResourceInventoryList

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Filters to scope the results. The following filters and logical  op-
          erators are supported:

          o account_id  -  The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns
            the resource. Logical operators are EQUALS | NOT_EQUALS .

          o application_name - The name of the application. Logical  operators
            are EQUALS | BEGINS_WITH .

          o license_included - The type of license included. Logical operators
            are EQUALS | NOT_EQUALS . Possible  values  are  sql-server-enter-
            prise | sql-server-standard | sql-server-web | windows-server-dat-
            acenter .

          o platform - The platform of the  resource.  Logical  operators  are
            EQUALS | BEGINS_WITH .

          o resource_id - The ID of the resource. Logical operators are EQUALS
            | NOT_EQUALS .

          o tag:<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the re-
            source.  Logical operators are EQUALS (single account) or EQUALS |
            NOT_EQUALS (cross account).

          (structure)
              An inventory filter.

              Name -> (string)
                 Name of the filter.

              Condition -> (string)
                 Condition of the filter.

              Value -> (string)
                 Value of the filter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Condition=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Condition": "EQUALS"|"NOT_EQUALS"|"BEGINS_WITH"|"CONTAINS",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
