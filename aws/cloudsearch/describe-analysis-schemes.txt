NAME
       describe-analysis-schemes -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  analysis schemes configured for a domain. An analysis scheme
       defines language-specific text processing options for a text field. Can
       be  limited to specific analysis schemes by name. By default, shows all
       analysis schemes and includes any pending changes to the configuration.
       Set  the  Deployed  option to true to show the active configuration and
       exclude pending changes. For more information, see Configuring Analysis
       Schemes in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of the domain you want to describe.

       --analysis-scheme-names (list)
          The analysis schemes you want to describe.

          (string)
              Names  must  begin  with  a letter and can contain the following
              characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and _ (underscore).

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --deployed | --no-deployed (boolean)
          Whether to display the deployed configuration (true ) or include any
          pending changes (false ). Defaults to false .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       AnalysisSchemes -> (list)
          The analysis scheme descriptions.

          (structure)
              The status and configuration of an AnalysisScheme .

              Options -> (structure)
                 Configuration information for an analysis scheme. Each analy-
                 sis  scheme  has  a unique name and specifies the language of
                 the text to be processed. The following options can  be  con-
                 figured  for an analysis scheme: Synonyms , Stopwords , Stem-
                 mingDictionary , JapaneseTokenizationDictionary and Algorith-
                 micStemming .

                 AnalysisSchemeName -> (string)
                     Names  must  begin with a letter and can contain the fol-
                     lowing characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9,  and  _  (under-
                     score).

                 AnalysisSchemeLanguage -> (string)
                     An  IETF  RFC 4646 language code or mul for multiple lan-
                     guages.

                 AnalysisOptions -> (structure)
                     Synonyms, stopwords, and stemming options for an analysis
                     scheme. Includes tokenization dictionary for Japanese.

                     Synonyms -> (string)
                        A JSON object that defines synonym groups and aliases.
                        A synonym group is an  array  of  arrays,  where  each
                        sub-array  is  a group of terms where each term in the
                        group is considered a synonym of every other  term  in
                        the  group.  The  aliases value is an object that con-
                        tains a collection of  string:value  pairs  where  the
                        string specifies a term and the array of values speci-
                        fies each of the aliases for that term.  An  alias  is
                        considered  a  synonym  of the specified term, but the
                        term is not considered a synonym  of  the  alias.  For
                        more   information   about  specifying  synonyms,  see
                        Synonyms in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide .

                     Stopwords -> (string)
                        A JSON array of terms to ignore  during  indexing  and
                        searching. For example, ["a", "an", "the", "of"] . The
                        stopwords dictionary must explicitly  list  each  word
                        you  want to ignore. Wildcards and regular expressions
                        are not supported.

                     StemmingDictionary -> (string)
                        A  JSON  object  that   contains   a   collection   of
                        string:value  pairs  that each map a term to its stem.
                        For  example,  {"term1":  "stem1",  "term2":  "stem2",
                        "term3": "stem3"} . The stemming dictionary is applied
                        in addition to any algorithmic stemming. This  enables
                        you  to  override the results of the algorithmic stem-
                        ming to correct specific cases of overstemming or  un-
                        derstemming. The maximum size of a stemming dictionary
                        is 500 KB.

                     JapaneseTokenizationDictionary -> (string)
                        A JSON array that contains a collection of terms,  to-
                        kens,  readings  and  part of speech for Japanese Tok-
                        enizaiton. The Japanese  tokenization  dictionary  en-
                        ables you to override the default tokenization for se-
                        lected terms. This is only valid for Japanese language
                        fields.

                     AlgorithmicStemming -> (string)
                        The  level  of algorithmic stemming to perform: none ,
                        minimal , light , or full . The available levels  vary
                        depending  on  the language. For more information, see
                        Language Specific Text Processing Settings in the Ama-
                        zon CloudSearch Developer Guide

              Status -> (structure)
                 The status of domain configuration option.

                 CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                     A timestamp for when this option was created.

                 UpdateDate -> (timestamp)
                     A timestamp for when this option was last updated.

                 UpdateVersion -> (integer)
                     A unique integer that indicates when this option was last
                     updated.

                 State -> (string)
                     The state of processing a change to an  option.  Possible
                     values:

                     o RequiresIndexDocuments : the option's latest value will
                       not be deployed until  IndexDocuments has  been  called
                       and indexing is complete.

                     o Processing  :  the  option's  latest  value  is  in the
                       process of being activated.

                     o Active : the option's latest value  is  completely  de-
                       ployed.

                     o FailedToValidate  :  the option value is not compatible
                       with the domain's data and cannot be used to index  the
                       data. You must either modify the option value or update
                       or remove the incompatible documents.

                 PendingDeletion -> (boolean)
                     Indicates that the option will be deleted once processing
                     is complete.
