DEFINE-INDEX-FIELD()                                      DEFINE-INDEX-FIELD()



NAME
       define-index-field -

DESCRIPTION
       Configures an `` IndexField`` for the search domain. Used to create new
       fields and modify existing ones. You must specify the name of  the  do-
       main  you  are  configuring and an index field configuration. The index
       field configuration specifies a unique name, the index field type,  and
       the  options  you  want to configure for the field. The options you can
       specify depend on the `` IndexFieldType`` . If the  field  exists,  the
       new  configuration  replaces  the  old  one.  For more information, see
       Configuring Index Fields in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          A string that represents the name of  a  domain.  Domain  names  are
          unique  across the domains owned by an account within an AWS region.
          Domain names start with a letter or number and can contain the  fol-
          lowing characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       --name (string)
          A  string  that  represents  the name of an index field. CloudSearch
          supports regular index fields as well as dynamic fields.  A  dynamic
          field's  name defines a pattern that begins or ends with a wildcard.
          Any document fields that don't map to a regular index field  but  do
          match  a  dynamic  field's  pattern  are configured with the dynamic
          field's indexing options.

          Regular field names begin with a letter and can contain the  follow-
          ing  characters:  a-z  (lowercase), 0-9, and _ (underscore). Dynamic
          field names must begin or end with a wildcard (*). The wildcard  can
          also  be  the only character in a dynamic field name. Multiple wild-
          cards, and wildcards embedded within a string are not supported.

          The name score is reserved and cannot be used as a  field  name.  To
          reference a document's ID, you can use the name _id .

       --type (string)
          The type of field. The valid options for a field depend on the field
          type. For more information about  the  supported  field  types,  see
          Configuring Index Fields in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide .

       --default-value  (string)  A  value  to  use for the field if the field
       isn't specified for a document. This can be important if you are  using
       the field in an expression and that field is not present in every docu-
       ment.

       --facet-enabled (boolean)
          Whether facet information can be returned for the field.

       --search-enabled (boolean)
          Whether the contents of the field are searchable.

       --return-enabled (boolean)
          Whether the contents of the field can be returned in the search  re-
          sults.

       --sort-enabled (boolean)
          Whether the field can be used to sort the search results.

       --source-field (string)
          The name of the source field to map to the field.

       --highlight-enabled (boolean)
          Whether highlights can be returned for the field.

       --analysis-scheme (string)
          The name of an analysis scheme for a text field.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       IndexField -> (structure)
          The value of an IndexField and its current status.

          Options -> (structure)
              Configuration information for a field in  the  index,  including
              its name, type, and options. The supported options depend on the
              `` IndexFieldType`` .

              IndexFieldName -> (string)
                 A string that represents the name of an index  field.  Cloud-
                 Search  supports  regular  index  fields  as  well as dynamic
                 fields. A dynamic field's name defines a pattern that  begins
                 or  ends  with a wildcard. Any document fields that don't map
                 to a regular index field but do match a dynamic field's  pat-
                 tern  are  configured  with  the dynamic field's indexing op-
                 tions.

                 Regular field names begin with a letter and can  contain  the
                 following  characters:  a-z  (lowercase),  0-9, and _ (under-
                 score). Dynamic field names must begin or end with a wildcard
                 (*). The wildcard can also be the only character in a dynamic
                 field name. Multiple wildcards, and wildcards embedded within
                 a string are not supported.

                 The  name  score  is  reserved  and cannot be used as a field
                 name. To reference a document's ID, you can use the name  _id
                 .

              IndexFieldType -> (string)
                 The  type  of  field. The valid options for a field depend on

                     A  string  that  represents  the  name of an index field.
                     CloudSearch supports regular index fields as well as  dy-
                     namic  fields.  A  dynamic field's name defines a pattern
                     that begins or ends with a wildcard. Any document  fields
                     that  don't  map  to a regular index field but do match a
                     dynamic field's pattern are configured with  the  dynamic
                     field's indexing options.

                     Regular  field  names begin with a letter and can contain
                     the following characters: a-z  (lowercase),  0-9,  and  _
                     (underscore).  Dynamic field names must begin or end with

                     that don't map to a regular index field but  do  match  a
                     dynamic  field's  pattern are configured with the dynamic
                     field's indexing options.

                     Regular field names begin with a letter and  can  contain
                     the  following  characters:  a-z  (lowercase), 0-9, and _
                     (underscore). Dynamic field names must begin or end  with
                     a wildcard (*). The wildcard can also be the only charac-
                     ter in a dynamic  field  name.  Multiple  wildcards,  and
                     wildcards embedded within a string are not supported.

                     The  name score is reserved and cannot be used as a field
                     name. To reference a document's ID, you can use the  name
                     _id .
