OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          A name for the domain you are creating. Allowed characters  are  a-z
          (lower-case  letters),  0-9, and hyphen (-). Domain names must start
          with a letter or number and be at least 3 and no more than 28  char-
          acters long.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       DomainStatus -> (structure)
          The current status of the search domain.

          DomainId -> (string)
              An internally generated unique identifier for a domain.

          DomainName -> (string)
              A string that represents the name of a domain. Domain names  are
              unique  across the domains owned by an account within an AWS re-
              gion. Domain names start with a letter or number and can contain
              the following characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

          ARN -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  search  domain. See
              Identifiers for IAM Entities in Using AWS  Identity  and  Access
              Management for more information.

          Created -> (boolean)
              True  if  the search domain is created. It can take several min-
              utes to initialize a domain when  CreateDomain is called.  Newly
              created search domains are returned from  DescribeDomains with a
              false value for Created until domain creation is complete.

          Deleted -> (boolean)
              True if the search domain has  been  deleted.  The  system  must
              clean  up resources dedicated to the search domain when  Delete-
              Domain is called. Newly deleted search domains are returned from
              DescribeDomains with a true value for IsDeleted for several min-
              utes until resource cleanup is complete.

          DocService -> (structure)
              The service endpoint for updating documents in a search domain.

              Endpoint -> (string)
                 The endpoint to which service requests can be submitted.  For
                 example,                            search-imdb-movies-oopcn-
                 jfn6ugofer3zx5iadxxca.eu-west-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com  or
                 doc-imdb-movies-oopcnjfn6ugofer3zx5iadxxca.eu-west-1.cloud-
                 search.amazonaws.com .

          SearchService -> (structure)
              The service endpoint for requesting search results from a search
              domain.

              Endpoint -> (string)
                 The  endpoint to which service requests can be submitted. For
                 example,                            search-imdb-movies-oopcn-
                 jfn6ugofer3zx5iadxxca.eu-west-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com  or
                 doc-imdb-movies-oopcnjfn6ugofer3zx5iadxxca.eu-west-1.cloud-

              True if processing is being done to activate the current  domain
              configuration.

          SearchInstanceType -> (string)
              The instance type that is being used to process search requests.

          SearchPartitionCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  partitions  across  which  the  search index is
              spread.

          SearchInstanceCount -> (integer)
              The number of search instances that  are  available  to  process
              search requests.
