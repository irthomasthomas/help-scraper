OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          A  string  that  represents  the  name of a domain. Domain names are
          unique across the domains owned by an account within an AWS  region.
          Domain  names start with a letter or number and can contain the fol-
          lowing characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       FieldNames -> (list)
          The names of the fields that are currently being indexed.

          (string)
              A string that represents the name of an index field. CloudSearch
              supports  regular  index fields as well as dynamic fields. A dy-
              namic field's name defines a pattern that begins or ends with  a
              wildcard.  Any document fields that don't map to a regular index
              field but do match a dynamic field's pattern are configured with
              the dynamic field's indexing options.

              Regular field names begin with a letter and can contain the fol-
              lowing characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and _ (underscore). Dy-
              namic  field  names  must  begin or end with a wildcard (*). The
              wildcard can also be the only character in a dynamic field name.
              Multiple  wildcards,  and wildcards embedded within a string are
              not supported.

              The name score is reserved and cannot be used as a  field  name.
              To reference a document's ID, you can use the name _id .
