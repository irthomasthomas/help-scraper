OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          A string that represents the name of  a  domain.  Domain  names  are
          unique  across the domains owned by an account within an AWS region.
          Domain names start with a letter or number and can contain the  fol-
          lowing characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       --analysis-scheme (structure)
          Configuration  information  for  an  analysis  scheme. Each analysis
          scheme has a unique name and specifies the language of the  text  to
          be  processed. The following options can be configured for an analy-
          sis scheme: Synonyms , Stopwords , StemmingDictionary , JapaneseTok-
          enizationDictionary and AlgorithmicStemming .

          AnalysisSchemeName -> (string)
              Names  must  begin  with  a letter and can contain the following
              characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and _ (underscore).

          AnalysisSchemeLanguage -> (string)
              An IETF RFC 4646 language code or mul for multiple languages.

          AnalysisOptions -> (structure)
              Synonyms,  stopwords,  and  stemming  options  for  an  analysis
              scheme. Includes tokenization dictionary for Japanese.

              Synonyms -> (string)
                 A JSON object that defines synonym groups and aliases. A syn-
                 onym group is an array of arrays, where each sub-array  is  a
                 group  of  terms where each term in the group is considered a
                 synonym of every other term in the group. The  aliases  value
                 is an object that contains a collection of string:value pairs
                 where the string specifies a term and  the  array  of  values
                 specifies each of the aliases for that term. An alias is con-
                 sidered a synonym of the specified term, but the term is  not
                 considered a synonym of the alias. For more information about
                 specifying synonyms, see Synonyms in the  Amazon  CloudSearch
                 Developer Guide .

              Stopwords -> (string)
                 A  JSON  array of terms to ignore during indexing and search-
                 ing. For example, ["a", "an", "the", "of"]  .  The  stopwords
                 dictionary must explicitly list each word you want to ignore.
                 Wildcards and regular expressions are not supported.

              StemmingDictionary -> (string)
                 A JSON object that  contains  a  collection  of  string:value
                 pairs  that  each  map  a  term  to  its  stem.  For example,
                 {"term1": "stem1", "term2": "stem2", "term3": "stem3"} .  The
                 stemming dictionary is applied in addition to any algorithmic
                 stemming. This enables you to override the results of the al-
                 gorithmic  stemming to correct specific cases of overstemming
                 or understemming. The maximum size of a  stemming  dictionary
                 is 500 KB.

              JapaneseTokenizationDictionary -> (string)
                 A  JSON  array  that  contains a collection of terms, tokens,
                 readings and part of speech for  Japanese  Tokenizaiton.  The
                 Japanese  tokenization dictionary enables you to override the
                 default tokenization for selected terms. This is  only  valid
                 for Japanese language fields.

              AlgorithmicStemming -> (string)
                 The  level of algorithmic stemming to perform: none , minimal
                 , light , or full . The available levels  vary  depending  on
                 the  language.  For  more  information, see Language Specific
                 Text Processing Settings in the Amazon CloudSearch  Developer
                 Guide

       Shorthand Syntax:

            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

          The status and configuration of an AnalysisScheme .

          Options -> (structure)
              Configuration information for an analysis scheme. Each  analysis
              scheme  has a unique name and specifies the language of the text
              to be processed. The following options can be configured for  an
              analysis  scheme:  Synonyms  ,  Stopwords , StemmingDictionary ,
              JapaneseTokenizationDictionary and AlgorithmicStemming .

                 scheme. Includes tokenization dictionary for Japanese.

                 Synonyms -> (string)
                     A JSON object that defines synonym groups and aliases.  A
                     synonym group is an array of arrays, where each sub-array
                     is a group of terms where each term in the group is  con-
                     sidered  a  synonym of every other term in the group. The
                     aliases value is an object that contains a collection  of
                     string:value  pairs where the string specifies a term and
                     the array of values specifies each  of  the  aliases  for
                     that term. An alias is considered a synonym of the speci-
                     fied term, but the term is not considered  a  synonym  of
                     the  alias.  For  more  information about specifying syn-
                     onyms, see Synonyms in the Amazon  CloudSearch  Developer
                     Guide .

                 Stopwords -> (string)
                     A  JSON  array  of  terms  to  ignore during indexing and
                     searching. For example, ["a", "an", "the",  "of"]  .  The
                     stopwords  dictionary  must explicitly list each word you
                     want to ignore. Wildcards and regular expressions are not
                     supported.

                 StemmingDictionary -> (string)
                     A  JSON object that contains a collection of string:value
                     pairs that each map a term  to  its  stem.  For  example,
                     {"term1":  "stem1", "term2": "stem2", "term3": "stem3"} .
                     The stemming dictionary is applied in addition to any al-
                     gorithmic  stemming. This enables you to override the re-
                     sults of the algorithmic  stemming  to  correct  specific
                     cases  of overstemming or understemming. The maximum size
                     of a stemming dictionary is 500 KB.

                 JapaneseTokenizationDictionary -> (string)
                     A JSON array that contains a collection of terms, tokens,
                     readings  and  part  of speech for Japanese Tokenizaiton.
                     The Japanese tokenization dictionary enables you to over-
                     ride the default tokenization for selected terms. This is
                     only valid for Japanese language fields.

                 AlgorithmicStemming -> (string)
                     The level of algorithmic stemming to perform: none , min-
                     imal  ,  light  , or full . The available levels vary de-
                     pending  on  the  language.  For  more  information,  see

                 A unique integer that indicates when this option was last up-
                 dated.

              State -> (string)
                 The  state of processing a change to an option. Possible val-
                 ues:

                 o RequiresIndexDocuments : the option's latest value will not
                   be  deployed  until  IndexDocuments has been called and in-
                   dexing is complete.

                 o Processing : the option's latest value is in the process of
                   being activated.

                 o Active : the option's latest value is completely deployed.

                 o FailedToValidate  : the option value is not compatible with
