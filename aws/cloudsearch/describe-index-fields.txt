OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of the domain you want to describe.

       --field-names (list)
          A list of the index fields you want to describe. If  not  specified,
          information is returned for all configured index fields.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --deployed | --no-deployed (boolean)
          Whether to display the deployed configuration (true ) or include any
          pending changes (false ). Defaults to false .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

OUTPUT
       IndexFields -> (list)
          The index fields configured for the domain.

          (structure)
              The value of an IndexField and its current status.

              Options -> (structure)
                 Configuration information for a field in the index, including
                 its name, type, and options. The supported options depend  on
                 the `` IndexFieldType`` .

                 IndexFieldName -> (string)
                     A  string  that  represents  the  name of an index field.
                     CloudSearch supports regular index fields as well as  dy-
                     namic  fields.  A  dynamic field's name defines a pattern
                     that begins or ends with a wildcard. Any document  fields
                     that  don't  map  to a regular index field but do match a
                     dynamic field's pattern are configured with  the  dynamic
                     field's indexing options.

                     Regular  field  names begin with a letter and can contain
                     the following characters: a-z  (lowercase),  0-9,  and  _
                     (underscore).  Dynamic field names must begin or end with
                     a wildcard (*). The wildcard can also be the only charac-
                     ter  in  a  dynamic  field  name. Multiple wildcards, and
                     wildcards embedded within a string are not supported.

                     The name score is reserved and cannot be used as a  field
                     name.  To reference a document's ID, you can use the name
                     _id .

                 IndexFieldType -> (string)
                     The type of field. The valid options for a  field  depend
                     on  the  field  type. For more information about the sup-
                     ported field types, see Configuring Index Fields  in  the
                     Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide .

                 IntOptions -> (structure)
                     Options for a 64-bit signed integer field. Present if In-
                     dexFieldType specifies the field is of type int . All op-
                     tions are enabled by default.

                     DefaultValue -> (long)
                        A value to use for the field if the field isn't speci-
                        fied for a document. This can be important if you  are
                        using the field in an expression and that field is not
                        present in every document.

                     SourceField -> (string)
                        The name of the source field to map to the field.

                     FacetEnabled -> (boolean)
                        Whether facet information  can  be  returned  for  the
                        field.

                     SearchEnabled -> (boolean)
                        Whether the contents of the field are searchable.

                     ReturnEnabled -> (boolean)
                        Whether  the  contents of the field can be returned in

                 DoubleOptions -> (structure)
                     Options  for  a  double-precision  64-bit  floating point
                     field. Present if IndexFieldType specifies the  field  is
                     of type double . All options are enabled by default.

                     DefaultValue -> (double)
                        A value to use for the field if the field isn't speci-

                        using the field in an expression and that field is not
                        present in every document.

                     SourceField -> (string)
                        The name of the source field to map to the field.

                     FacetEnabled -> (boolean)
                        Whether facet information  can  be  returned  for  the

                     SortEnabled -> (boolean)
                        Whether the field can be used to sort the  search  re-
                        sults.

                 LiteralOptions -> (structure)
                     Options  for  literal  field.  Present  if IndexFieldType
                     specifies the field is of type literal . All options  are
                     enabled by default.

                     DefaultValue -> (string)
                        A value to use for the field if the field isn't speci-

                        A string that represents the name of an  index  field.
                        CloudSearch  supports  regular index fields as well as
                        dynamic fields. A dynamic field's name defines a  pat-
                        tern that begins or ends with a wildcard. Any document
                        fields that don't map to a regular index field but  do
                        match  a  dynamic  field's pattern are configured with
                        the dynamic field's indexing options.

                        Regular field names begin with a letter and  can  con-
                        tain  the  following characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9,

                        end  with a wildcard (*). The wildcard can also be the
                        only character in a dynamic field name. Multiple wild-
                        cards,  and wildcards embedded within a string are not
                        supported.

                        The name score is reserved and cannot  be  used  as  a
                        field  name. To reference a document's ID, you can use
                        the name _id .

                     FacetEnabled -> (boolean)
                        Whether facet information  can  be  returned  for  the
                        field.

                     SearchEnabled -> (boolean)

                 TextOptions -> (structure)
                     Options  for text field. Present if IndexFieldType speci-
                     fies the field is of type text . A text field  is  always
                     searchable. All options are enabled by default.

                     DefaultValue -> (string)
                        A value to use for the field if the field isn't speci-

                        tern that begins or ends with a wildcard. Any document
                        fields that don't map to a regular index field but  do
                        match  a  dynamic  field's pattern are configured with
                        the dynamic field's indexing options.

                        Regular field names begin with a letter and  can  con-
                        tain  the  following characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9,
                        and _ (underscore). Dynamic field names must begin  or
                        end  with a wildcard (*). The wildcard can also be the
                        only character in a dynamic field name. Multiple wild-
                        cards,  and wildcards embedded within a string are not
                        supported.

                        The name score is reserved and cannot  be  used  as  a
                        field  name. To reference a document's ID, you can use
                        the name _id .
