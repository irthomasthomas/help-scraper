NAME
       get-mobile-device-access-effect -

DESCRIPTION
       Simulates  the  effect  of the mobile device access rules for the given
       attributes of a sample access event. Use this method to  test  the  ef-
       fects of the current set of mobile device access rules for the WorkMail
       organization for a particular user's attributes.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

OPTIONS
       --organization-id (string)
          The WorkMail organization to simulate the access effect for.

       --device-type (string)
          Device type the simulated user will report.

       --device-model (string)
          Device model the simulated user will report.

       --device-operating-system (string)
          Device operating system the simulated user will report.

       --device-user-agent (string)
          Device user agent the simulated user will report.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Effect -> (string)
          The effect of the simulated access, ALLOW or DENY , after evaluating
          mobile device access rules in the WorkMail organization for the sim-
          ulated user parameters.

       MatchedRules -> (list)
          A  list of the rules which matched the simulated user input and pro-
          duced the effect.

          (structure)
              The rule that a simulated user matches.

              MobileDeviceAccessRuleId -> (string)
                 Identifier of the rule that a simulated user matches.

              Name -> (string)
                 Name of a rule that a simulated user matches.
