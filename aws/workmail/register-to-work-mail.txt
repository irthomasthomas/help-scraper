REGISTER-TO-WORK-MAIL()                                REGISTER-TO-WORK-MAIL()



NAME
       register-to-work-mail -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers  an existing and disabled user, group, or resource for Amazon
       WorkMail use by associating a mailbox and calendaring capabilities.  It
       performs no change if the user, group, or resource is enabled and fails
       if the user, group, or resource is deleted. This operation  results  in
       the  accumulation  of  costs.  For  more information, see Pricing . The
       equivalent console functionality for this operation is Enable .

       Users can either be created by calling the  CreateUser API operation or
       they can be synchronized from your directory. For more information, see
       DeregisterFromWorkMail .

SYNOPSIS
            register-to-work-mail
          --organization-id <value>
          --entity-id <value>
          --email <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-id (string)
          The identifier for the organization under which the user, group,  or
          resource exists.

       --entity-id (string)
          The identifier for the user, group, or resource to be updated.

       --email (string)
          The email for the user, group, or resource to be updated.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
