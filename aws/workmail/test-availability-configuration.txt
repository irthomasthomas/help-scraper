TEST-AVAILABILITY-CONFIGURATION()            TEST-AVAILABILITY-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       test-availability-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Performs  a  test  on an availability provider to ensure that access is
       allowed. For EWS, it verifies the provided credentials can be  used  to
       successfully  log  in. For Lambda, it verifies that the Lambda function
       can be invoked and that the resource access policy  was  configured  to
       deny anonymous access. An anonymous invocation is one done without pro-
       viding either a SourceArn or SourceAccount header.

       NOTE:
          The request must contain either one provider definition (EwsProvider
          or  LambdaProvider  ) or the DomainName parameter. If the DomainName
          parameter is provided, the configuration stored under the DomainName
          will be tested.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            test-availability-configuration
          --organization-id <value>
          [--domain-name <value>]
          [--ews-provider <value>]
          [--lambda-provider <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-id (string)
          The  Amazon  WorkMail  organization  where the availability provider
          will be tested.

       --domain-name (string)
          The domain to which the provider applies. If this field is provided,
          a  stored  availability provider associated to this domain name will
          be tested.

       --ews-provider (structure)
          Describes an EWS based availability provider. This is only  used  as
          input to the service.

          EwsEndpoint -> (string)
              The endpoint of the remote EWS server.

          EwsUsername -> (string)
              The username used to authenticate the remote EWS server.

          EwsPassword -> (string)
              The password used to authenticate the remote EWS server.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EwsEndpoint=string,EwsUsername=string,EwsPassword=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "EwsEndpoint": "string",
            "EwsUsername": "string",
            "EwsPassword": "string"
          }

       --lambda-provider (structure)
          Describes a Lambda based availability provider.

          LambdaArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the Lambda that acts as the
              availability provider.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          LambdaArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "LambdaArn": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TestPassed -> (boolean)
          Boolean indicating whether the test passed or failed.

       FailureReason -> (string)
          String  containing  the  reason  for  a failed test if TestPassed is
          false.
