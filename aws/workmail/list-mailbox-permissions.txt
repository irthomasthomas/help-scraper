LIST-MAILBOX-PERMISSIONS()                          LIST-MAILBOX-PERMISSIONS()



NAME
       list-mailbox-permissions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  mailbox  permissions  associated with a user, group, or re-
       source mailbox.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-mailbox-permissions is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: Permissions

OPTIONS
       --organization-id (string)
          The  identifier  of the organization under which the user, group, or
          resource exists.

       --entity-id (string)
          The identifier of the user, or resource for which  to  list  mailbox
          permissions.

          The  entity  ID  can  accept  UserId or ResourceId , Username or Re-
          sourcename , or email .

          o Entity      ID:      12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012,      or
            r-0123456789a0123456789b0123456789

          o Email address: entity@domain.tld

          o Entity name: entity

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve mailbox permissions

       The  following  list-mailbox-permissions  command retrieves the mailbox
       permissions associated with the specified entity's mailbox.

          aws workmail list-mailbox-permissions \
              --organization-id m-d281d0a2fd824be5b6cd3d3ce909fd27 \
              --entity-id S-1-1-11-1111111111-2222222222-3333333333-3333

       Output:

          {
              "Permissions": [
                  {
                      "GranteeId": "S-1-1-11-1122222222-2222233333-3333334444-4444",
                      "GranteeType": "USER",
                      "PermissionValues": [
                          "FULL_ACCESS"
                      ]
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Permissions -> (list)
          One page of the user, group, or resource mailbox permissions.

          (structure)
              Permission granted to a user, group, or  resource  to  access  a
              certain aspect of another user, group, or resource mailbox.

              GranteeId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of the user, group, or resource to which the
                 permissions are granted.

              GranteeType -> (string)
                 The  type  of  user,  group,  or  resource  referred  to   in
                 GranteeId.

              PermissionValues -> (list)
                 The  permissions  granted  to the grantee. SEND_AS allows the
                 grantee to send email  as  the  owner  of  the  mailbox  (the
                 grantee is not mentioned on these emails). SEND_ON_BEHALF al-
                 lows the grantee to send email on behalf of the owner of  the
                 mailbox  (the grantee is not mentioned as the physical sender
                 of these emails). FULL_ACCESS allows the grantee full  access
                 to  the  mailbox,  irrespective of other folder-level permis-
                 sions set on the mailbox.

                 (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. The value  is
