LIST-RESOURCE-DELEGATES()                            LIST-RESOURCE-DELEGATES()



NAME
       list-resource-delegates -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the delegates associated with a resource. Users and groups can be
       resource delegates and answer requests on behalf of the resource.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-resource-delegates is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: Delegates

SYNOPSIS
            list-resource-delegates
          --organization-id <value>
          --resource-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-id (string)
          The  identifier  for the organization that contains the resource for
          which delegates are listed.

       --resource-id (string)
          The identifier for the resource whose delegates are listed.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the delegates for a resource

       The  following  list-resource-delegates command retrieves the delegates
       associated with the specified resource.

          aws workmail list-resource-delegates \
              --organization-id m-d281d0a2fd824be5b6cd3d3ce909fd27 \
              --resource-id r-68bf2d3b1c0244aab7264c24b9217443

       Output:

          {
              "Delegates": [
                  {
                      "Id": "S-1-1-11-1111111111-2222222222-3333333333-3333",
                      "Type": "USER"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Delegates -> (list)
          One page of the resource's delegates.

          (structure)
              The name of the attribute, which is one of the values defined in
              the UserAttribute enumeration.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  identifier  for  the user or group associated as the re-
                 source's delegate.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of the delegate: user or group.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token used to paginate through the delegates associated  with  a
          resource.  While  results  are still available, it has an associated
          value. When the last page is reached, the token is empty.
