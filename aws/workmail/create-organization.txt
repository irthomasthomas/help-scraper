CREATE-ORGANIZATION()                                    CREATE-ORGANIZATION()



NAME
       create-organization -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new Amazon WorkMail organization. Optionally, you can choose
       to associate an existing AWS Directory Service directory with your  or-
       ganization.  If an AWS Directory Service directory ID is specified, the
       organization alias must match the directory alias. If you choose not to
       associate  an existing directory with your organization, then we create
       a new Amazon WorkMail directory for  you.  For  more  information,  see
       Adding an organization in the Amazon WorkMail Administrator Guide .

       You can associate multiple email domains with an organization, then set
       your default email domain from the Amazon  WorkMail  console.  You  can
       also  associate  a  domain that is managed in an Amazon Route 53 public
       hosted zone. For more information, see Adding a domain and Choosing the
       default domain in the Amazon WorkMail Administrator Guide .

       Optionally, you can use a customer managed master key from AWS Key Man-
       agement Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt email for  your  organization.  If
       you  don't  associate an AWS KMS key, Amazon WorkMail creates a default
       AWS managed master key for you.

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The AWS Directory Service directory ID.

       --alias (string)

              When you configure a domain hosted in  Amazon  Route  53  (Route
              53),  all  recommended DNS records are added to the organization
              when you create it. For more information, see Adding a domain in
              the Amazon WorkMail Administrator Guide .

              DomainName -> (string)
                 The fully qualified domain name.

              HostedZoneId -> (string)
                 The  hosted zone ID for a domain hosted in Route 53. Required
                 when configuring a domain hosted in Route 53.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DomainName=string,HostedZoneId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "DomainName": "string",
              "HostedZoneId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

          Connector directory ID is included in the request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
