CREATE-CONNECTOR()                                          CREATE-CONNECTOR()



NAME
       create-connector -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  SCEP  connector. A SCEP connector links Amazon Web Services
       Private Certificate Authority to your SCEP-compatible devices  and  mo-
       bile  device  management  (MDM) systems. Before you create a connector,
       you must complete a set of prerequisites, including creation of a  pri-
       vate  certificate  authority  (CA) to use with this connector. For more
       information, see Connector for SCEP prerequisites .

OPTIONS
       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon  Web  Services  Private
          Certificate Authority certificate authority to use with this connec-
          tor. Due to security vulnerabilities present in the  SCEP  protocol,
          we  recommend  using  a private CA that's dedicated for use with the
          connector.

          To retrieve the private CAs associated with your  account,  you  can
          call  ListCertificateAuthorities  using the Amazon Web Services Pri-
          vate CA API.

       --mobile-device-management (tagged union structure)
          If you don't supply a value, by default Connector for SCEP creates a
          connector  for  general-purpose  use. A general-purpose connector is
          designed to work with clients or endpoints  that  support  the  SCEP
          protocol,  except Connector for SCEP for Microsoft Intune. With con-
          nectors for general-purpose use, you manage SCEP challenge passwords
          using  Connector  for SCEP. For information about considerations and
          limitations with using Connector for SCEP,  see  Considerations  and
          Limitations .

          If you provide an IntuneConfiguration , Connector for SCEP creates a
          connector for use with Microsoft Intune, and you  manage  the  chal-
          lenge  passwords  using  Microsoft Intune. For more information, see
          Using Connector for SCEP for Microsoft Intune .

          NOTE:
              This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following  top
              level keys can be set: Intune.

          Intune -> (structure)
              Configuration settings for use with Microsoft Intune. For infor-
              mation about using Connector for SCEP for Microsoft Intune,  see
              Using Connector for SCEP for Microsoft Intune .

              AzureApplicationId -> (string)
                 The  directory  (tenant)  ID from your Microsoft Entra ID app
                 registration.

              Domain -> (string)
                 The primary domain from your Microsoft Entra ID app registra-
                 tion.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Intune={AzureApplicationId=string,Domain=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Intune": {
              "AzureApplicationId": "string",
              "Domain": "string"
            }
          }

       --client-token (string)
          Custom  string  that can be used to distinguish between calls to the
          CreateChallenge action. Client tokens for CreateChallenge  time  out
          after  five minutes. Therefore, if you call CreateChallenge multiple
          times with the same client token within five minutes, Connector  for
          SCEP  recognizes that you are requesting only one challenge and will
          only respond with one. If you change the client token for each call,
          Connector for SCEP recognizes that you are requesting multiple chal-
          lenge passwords.

       --tags (map)
          The key-value pairs to associate with the resource.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
