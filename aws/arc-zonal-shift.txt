NAME
       arc-zonal-shift -

DESCRIPTION
       This  is  the API Reference Guide for the zonal shift feature of Amazon
       Route 53 Application Recovery Controller. This guide is for  developers
       who  need  detailed  information  about  zonal  shift API actions, data
       types, and errors.

       Zonal shift is in preview release for Amazon Route 53  Application  Re-
       covery Controller and is subject to change.

       Zonal shift in Route 53 ARC enables you to move traffic for a load bal-
       ancer resource away from an Availability Zone. Starting a  zonal  shift
       helps  your application recover immediately, for example, from a devel-
       oper's bad code deployment or from an AWS infrastructure failure  in  a
       single Availability Zone, reducing the impact and time lost from an is-
       sue in one zone.

       Supported AWS resources are automatically registered with Route 53 ARC.
       Resources that are registered for zonal shifts in Route 53 ARC are man-
       aged resources in Route 53 ARC. You can start a  zonal  shift  for  any
       managed  resource  in  your  account in a Region. At this time, you can
       only start a zonal shift for Network  Load  Balancers  and  Application
       Load Balancers with cross-zone load balancing turned off.

       Zonal  shifts  are  temporary.  You must specify an expiration when you
       start a zonal shift, of up to three days  initially.  If  you  want  to
       still  keep  traffic away from an Availability Zone, you can update the
       zonal shift and set a new expiration.  You  can  also  cancel  a  zonal
       shift, before it expires, for example, if you're ready to restore traf-
       fic to the Availability Zone.

       For more information about using zonal shift, see the Amazon  Route  53
       Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide .
