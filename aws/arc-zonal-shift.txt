ARC-ZONAL-SHIFT()                                            ARC-ZONAL-SHIFT()



NAME
       arc-zonal-shift -

DESCRIPTION
       Welcome  to the Zonal Shift API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53 Ap-
       plication Recovery Controller (Route 53 ARC).

       You can start a zonal shift to move traffic for  a  load  balancer  re-
       source  away from an Availability Zone to help your application recover
       quickly from an impairment in an Availability Zone.  For  example,  you
       can  recover your application from a developer's bad code deployment or
       from an Amazon Web Services infrastructure failure in a  single  Avail-
       ability Zone.

       You  can  also  configure zonal autoshift for a load balancer resource.
       Zonal autoshift is a capability in Route 53 ARC where Amazon  Web  Ser-
       vices  shifts  away  application  resource traffic from an Availability
       Zone, on your behalf, to help  reduce  your  time  to  recovery  during
       events.  Amazon Web Services shifts away traffic for resources that are
       enabled for zonal autoshift whenever  Amazon  Web  Services  determines
       that  there's  an issue in the Availability Zone that could potentially
       affect customers.

       To ensure that zonal autoshift is safe for your application,  you  must
       also  configure practice runs when you enable zonal autoshift for a re-
       source. Practice runs start weekly zonal  shifts  for  a  resource,  to
       shift  traffic  for  the resource out of an Availability Zone. Practice
       runs make sure, on a regular basis, that you have  enough  capacity  in
       all  the  Availability  Zones in an Amazon Web Services Region for your
       application to continue to operate normally when traffic for a resource
       is shifted away from one Availability Zone.

       WARNING:
          You must prescale resource capacity in all Availability Zones in the
          Region where your application  is  deployed,  before  you  configure
          practice  runs  or enable zonal autoshift for a resource. You should
          not rely on scaling on demand when  an  autoshift  or  practice  run
          starts.

       For  more  information about using zonal shift and zonal autoshift, see
       the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide .
