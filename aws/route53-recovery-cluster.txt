DESCRIPTION
       Welcome  to  the Routing Control (Recovery Cluster) API Reference Guide
       for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller.

       With Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller, you can use rout-
       ing control with extreme reliability to recover applications by rerout-
       ing traffic across Availability Zones or AWS Regions. Routing  controls
       are  simple on/off switches hosted on a highly available cluster in Ap-
       plication Recovery Controller. A cluster provides a set of five  redun-
       dant  Regional  endpoints against which you can run API calls to get or
       update the state of routing controls. To implement  failover,  you  set
       one routing control on and another one off, to reroute traffic from one
       Availability Zone or Amazon Web Services Region to another.
          Be aware that you must specify the Regional endpoints for a  cluster
          when  you  work with API cluster operations to get or update routing
          control states in Application Recovery Controller. In addition,  you
          must  specify  the  US West (Oregon) Region for Application Recovery
          Controller  API  calls.  For  example,  use  the  parameter   region
          us-west-2  with  AWS CLI commands. For more information, see Get and
          update routing control states using the API in the Amazon  Route  53
          Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.

       This API guide includes information about the API operations for how to
       get and update routing control  states  in  Application  Recovery  Con-
       troller.  You  also  must set up the structures to support routing con-
       trols: clusters and control panels.

       For more information about working with routing control in  Application
       Recovery Controller, see the following:

       o To create clusters, routing controls, and control panels by using the
         control plane API for routing control, see the Recovery Control  Con-
         figuration API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53 Application Recov-
         ery Controller .

       o Learn about the components in recovery control configuration, includ-
         ing clusters, routing controls, and control panels. For more informa-
         tion, see Recovery control components in the Amazon Route 53 Applica-
         tion Recovery Controller Developer Guide.

       o Application  Recovery  Controller also provides readiness checks that
         run continually to help make sure that your applications  are  scaled
         and  ready to handle failover traffic. For more information about the
         related API actions, see the Recovery Readiness API  Reference  Guide
         for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller .

       o For  more  information about creating resilient applications and pre-
         paring for recovery readiness with Application  Recovery  Controller,
         see  the  Amazon  Route  53 Application Recovery Controller Developer
         Guide .
