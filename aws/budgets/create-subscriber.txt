       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-subscriber
          --account-id <value>
          --budget-name <value>
          --notification <value>
          --subscriber <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The accountId that is associated with the budget that  you  want  to
          create a subscriber for.

       --budget-name (string)
          The  name  of the budget that you want to subscribe to. Budget names
          must be unique within an account.

       --notification (structure)
          The notification that you want to create a subscriber for.

          NotificationType -> (string)
              Specifies whether the notification is  for  how  much  you  have
              spent  (ACTUAL ) or for how much that you're forecasted to spend
              (FORECASTED ).

          ComparisonOperator -> (string)
              The comparison that's used for this notification.

          Threshold -> (double)
              The threshold that's associated with a notification.  Thresholds
              are  always  a  percentage,  and many customers find value being
              alerted between 50% - 200% of the budgeted amount.  The  maximum
              limit  for  your  threshold  is  1,000,000%  above  the budgeted
              amount.

          ThresholdType -> (string)
              The type of threshold for  a  notification.  For  ABSOLUTE_VALUE
              thresholds, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go over or
              are forecasted to go over your total cost  threshold.  For  PER-
              CENTAGE thresholds, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go
              over or are forecasted to go over a certain percentage  of  your
              forecasted spend. For example, if you have a budget for 200 dol-
              lars and you have a PERCENTAGE threshold of 80%, Amazon Web Ser-
              vices notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.

          NotificationState -> (string)
              Specifies whether this notification is in alarm. If a budget no-
              tification is in the ALARM state, you passed the  set  threshold
              for the budget.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NotificationType=string,ComparisonOperator=string,Threshold=double,ThresholdType=string,NotificationState=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "NotificationType": "ACTUAL"|"FORECASTED",
            "ComparisonOperator": "GREATER_THAN"|"LESS_THAN"|"EQUAL_TO",
            "Threshold": double,
            "ThresholdType": "PERCENTAGE"|"ABSOLUTE_VALUE",
            "NotificationState": "OK"|"ALARM"
          }

       --subscriber (structure)
          The  subscriber  that  you want to associate with a budget notifica-
          tion.

          SubscriptionType -> (string)
              The type of notification that Amazon Web  Services  sends  to  a
              subscriber.

          Address -> (string)
              The  address that Amazon Web Services sends budget notifications
              to, either an SNS topic or an email.

              When you create a subscriber, the value of Address can't contain
              line breaks.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SubscriptionType=string,Address=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SubscriptionType": "SNS"|"EMAIL",
            "Address": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
