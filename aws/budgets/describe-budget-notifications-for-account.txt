NAME
       describe-budget-notifications-for-account -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  budget  names and notifications that are associated with an
       account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-budget-notifications-for-account  is  a  paginated  operation.
       Multiple  API  calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data
       set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the  --no-pagi-
       nate  argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a
       paginated response, the --query argument must extract data from the re-
       sults of the following query expressions: BudgetNotificationsForAccount

SYNOPSIS

          --account-id <value>

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The account ID of the user. It's a 12-digit number.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       BudgetNotificationsForAccount -> (list)
          A list of budget names and associated notifications for an account.

          (structure)
              The budget name and associated notifications for an account.

              Notifications -> (list)
                 A list of notifications.

                 (structure)
                     A  notification that's associated with a budget. A budget
                     can have up to ten notifications.

                     Each notification must have at least  one  subscriber.  A
                     notification  can  have  one  SNS subscriber and up to 10
                     email subscribers, for a total of 11 subscribers.

                     For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you
                     want  to be notified when you go over 160 dollars, create
                     a notification with the following parameters:

                     o A notificationType of ACTUAL

                     o A thresholdType of PERCENTAGE

                     o A comparisonOperator of GREATER_THAN

                     o A notification threshold of 80

                     NotificationType -> (string)
                        Specifies whether the notification is for how much you
                        have spent (ACTUAL ) or for how much that you're fore-
                        casted to spend (FORECASTED ).

                     ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                        The comparison that's used for this notification.

                     Threshold -> (double)
                        The threshold that's associated with  a  notification.
                        Thresholds are always a percentage, and many customers
                        find value being alerted between 50%  -  200%  of  the
                        budgeted  amount. The maximum limit for your threshold
                        is 1,000,000% above the budgeted amount.

                     ThresholdType -> (string)
                        The type of threshold for a  notification.  For  ABSO-
                        LUTE_VALUE  thresholds,  Amazon  Web Services notifies
                        you when you go over or are forecasted to go over your
                        total  cost threshold. For PERCENTAGE thresholds, Ama-
                        zon Web Services notifies you when you go over or  are
                        forecasted  to  go  over  a certain percentage of your
                        forecasted spend. For example, if you  have  a  budget
                        for 200 dollars and you have a PERCENTAGE threshold of
                        80%, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go over
                        160 dollars.

                     NotificationState -> (string)
                        Specifies  whether this notification is in alarm. If a
                        budget notification is in the ALARM state, you  passed
                        the set threshold for the budget.

              BudgetName -> (string)
                 A  string  that  represents  the  budget name. The ":" and ""
                 characters, and the "/action/" substring, aren't allowed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A generic string.
