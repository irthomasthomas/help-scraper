DESCRIBE-BUDGETS()                                          DESCRIBE-BUDGETS()



NAME
       describe-budgets -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the budgets that are associated with an account.

       WARNING:
          The  Request  Syntax  section  shows  the  BudgetLimit  syntax.  For
          PlannedBudgetLimits , see the Examples section.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-budgets is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Budgets

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  accountId that is associated with the budgets that you want de-
          scriptions of.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       Budgets -> (list)
          A list of budgets.

          (structure)
              Represents the output of the CreateBudget operation. The content
              consists of the detailed metadata and data file information, and
              the current status of the budget object.

              This is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) pattern for a budget:
                 arn:aws:budgets::AccountId:budget/budgetName

              BudgetName -> (string)
                 The  name  of a budget. The name must be unique within an ac-
                 count. The : and \ characters aren't allowed in BudgetName .

              BudgetLimit -> (structure)
                 The total amount of cost, usage, RI utilization, RI coverage,
                 Savings Plans utilization, or Savings Plans coverage that you
                 want to track with your budget.
                     BudgetLimit is required for cost or  usage  budgets,  but
                     optional  for RI or Savings Plans utilization or coverage
                     budgets. RI and Savings  Plans  utilization  or  coverage
                     budgets default to 100 . This is the only valid value for
                     RI or Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets.  You
                     can't  use  BudgetLimit with PlannedBudgetLimits for Cre-
                     ateBudget and UpdateBudget actions.

                 Amount -> (string)
                     The cost or usage amount that's associated with a  budget
                     forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold.

                 Unit -> (string)
                     The  unit of measurement that's used for the budget fore-
                     cast, actual spend, or budget threshold, such as  USD  or
                     GBP.

              PlannedBudgetLimits -> (map)
                 A  map containing multiple BudgetLimit , including current or
                 future limits.
                     PlannedBudgetLimits is available for cost or usage budget
                     and supports both monthly and quarterly TimeUnit .

                 For monthly budgets, provide 12 months of PlannedBudgetLimits
                 values. This must start from the current  month  and  include
                 the next 11 months. The key is the start of the month, UTC in
                 epoch seconds.

                 For quarterly budgets, provide four quarters  of  PlannedBud-
                 getLimits  value  entries in standard calendar quarter incre-
                 ments. This must start from the current quarter  and  include
                 the next three quarters. The key is the start of the quarter,
                 UTC in epoch seconds.

                 If the planned budget expires before 12 months for monthly or
                 four  quarters for quarterly, provide the PlannedBudgetLimits
                 values only for the remaining periods.

                 If the budget  begins  at  a  date  in  the  future,  provide
                 PlannedBudgetLimits values from the start date of the budget.

                 After  all  of  the BudgetLimit values in PlannedBudgetLimits
                 are used, the budget continues to use the last limit  as  the
                 BudgetLimit  . At that point, the planned budget provides the
                 same experience as a fixed budget.
                     DescribeBudget and DescribeBudgets  response  along  with
                     PlannedBudgetLimits also contain BudgetLimit representing
                     the current month or quarter limit present in PlannedBud-
                     getLimits . This only applies to budgets that are created
                     with PlannedBudgetLimits . Budgets that are created with-
                     out  PlannedBudgetLimits  only contain BudgetLimit . They
                     don't contain PlannedBudgetLimits .

                 key -> (string)
                     A generic string.

                 value -> (structure)
                     The amount of cost or usage that's measured for a budget.

                     For example, a Spend for 3 GB of S3 usage has the follow-
                     ing parameters:

                     o An Amount of 3

                     o A unit of GB

                     Amount -> (string)
                        The cost or usage amount that's associated with a bud-
                        get forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        The unit of measurement that's  used  for  the  budget
                        forecast,  actual  spend, or budget threshold, such as
                        USD or GBP.

              CostFilters -> (map)
                 The cost filters, such as Region , Service , member account ,
                 Tag , or Cost Category , that are applied to a budget.

                 Amazon  Web  Services Budgets supports the following services
                 as a Service filter for RI budgets:

                 o Amazon EC2

                 o Amazon Redshift

                 o Amazon Relational Database Service

                 o Amazon ElastiCache

                 o Amazon OpenSearch Service

                 key -> (string)

                 The length of time until a budget resets the actual and fore-
                 casted spend.

              TimePeriod -> (structure)
                 The period of time that's covered by  a  budget.  You  setthe
                 start  date and end date. The start date must come before the
                 end date. The end date must come before 06/15/87 00:00 UTC .

                 If you create your budget and don't  specify  a  start  date,
                 Amazon Web Services defaults to the start of your chosen time
                 period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example,
                 if you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose DAILY ,
                 and didn't set a start date, Amazon  Web  Services  set  your
                 start  date  to  01/24/18  00:00 UTC . If you chose MONTHLY ,
                 Amazon Web Services set your start date to 01/01/18 00:00 UTC
                 .  If you didn't specify an end date, Amazon Web Services set
                 your end date to 06/15/87 00:00 UTC . The  defaults  are  the
                 same for the Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

                 You can change either date with the UpdateBudget operation.

                 After  the  end  date, Amazon Web Services deletes the budget

                 Start -> (timestamp)
                     The start date for a budget. If you created  your  budget
                     and  didn't specify a start date, Amazon Web Services de-
                     faults to the start of your chosen  time  period  (DAILY,
                     MONTHLY,  QUARTERLY,  or  ANNUALLY).  For example, if you
                     created your budget on January 24, 2018,  chose  DAILY  ,
                     and didn't set a start date, Amazon Web Services set your
                     start date to 01/24/18 00:00 UTC . If you chose MONTHLY ,
                     Amazon Web Services set your start date to 01/01/18 00:00
                     UTC . The defaults are the same for the Billing and  Cost
                     Management console and the API.

                     You  can change your start date with the UpdateBudget op-
                     eration.

                 End -> (timestamp)
                     The end date for a budget. If you didn't specify  an  end
                     date,  Amazon  Web Services set your end date to 06/15/87
                     00:00 UTC . The defaults are the same for the Billing and
                     Cost Management console and the API.

                     After  the end date, Amazon Web Services deletes the bud-
                     get and all the associated notifications and subscribers.
                     You can change your end date with the UpdateBudget opera-
                     tion.

                 The  parameters  that  determine  the  budget  amount  for an
                 auto-adjusting budget.

                     The string that defines whether your budget  auto-adjusts
                     based on historical or forecasted data.

                        The number of budget  periods  included  in  the  mov-
                        ing-average  calculation that determines your auto-ad-
                        justed budget amount. The maximum value depends on the
                        TimeUnit granularity of the budget:

                        o For the DAILY granularity, the maximum value is 60 .

                        o For the MONTHLY granularity, the maximum value is 12
                          .

                        o For the QUARTERLY granularity, the maximum value  is
                          4 .

                        o For the ANNUALLY granularity, the maximum value is 1
                          .

                     LookBackAvailablePeriods -> (integer)
                        The integer that describes how many budget periods  in
                        your BudgetAdjustmentPeriod are included in the calcu-
                        lation of your current BudgetLimit . If the first bud-
                        get  period in your BudgetAdjustmentPeriod has no cost
                        data, then that budget period isnt included in the av-
                        erage that determines your budget limit.

                        For  example,  if  you set BudgetAdjustmentPeriod as 4
                        quarters, but your account had no  cost  data  in  the
                        first  quarter,  then only the last three quarters are
                        included in the calculation. In this  scenario,  Look-
                        BackAvailablePeriods returns 3 .

                        You  cant  set your own LookBackAvailablePeriods . The
                        value is automatically calculated from  the  BudgetAd-
                        justmentPeriod and your historical cost data.

                 LastAutoAdjustTime -> (timestamp)
                     The last time that your budget was auto-adjusted.
