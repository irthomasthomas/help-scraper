NAME
       describe-subscribers-for-notification -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the subscribers that are associated with a notification.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-subscribers-for-notification  is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate ar-
       gument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on  a  pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: Subscribers

SYNOPSIS
            describe-subscribers-for-notification
          --account-id <value>
          --budget-name <value>
          --notification <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The accountId that is associated with the budget  whose  subscribers
          you want descriptions of.

       --budget-name (string)
          The name of the budget whose subscribers you want descriptions of.

       --notification (structure)
          The notification whose subscribers you want to list.

          NotificationType -> (string)
              Specifies  whether  the  notification  is  for how much you have
              spent (ACTUAL ) or for how much that you're forecasted to  spend
              (FORECASTED ).

          ComparisonOperator -> (string)
              The comparison that's used for this notification.

          Threshold -> (double)
              The  threshold that's associated with a notification. Thresholds
              are always a percentage, and many  customers  find  value  being
              alerted  between  50% - 200% of the budgeted amount. The maximum
              limit for  your  threshold  is  1,000,000%  above  the  budgeted
              amount.

          ThresholdType -> (string)
              The  type  of  threshold  for a notification. For ABSOLUTE_VALUE
              thresholds, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go over or
              are  forecasted  to  go over your total cost threshold. For PER-
              CENTAGE thresholds, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go
              over  or  are forecasted to go over a certain percentage of your
              forecasted spend. For example, if you have a budget for 200 dol-
              lars and you have a PERCENTAGE threshold of 80%, Amazon Web Ser-
              vices notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.

          NotificationState -> (string)
              Specifies whether this notification is in alarm. If a budget no-
              tification  is  in the ALARM state, you passed the set threshold
              for the budget.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NotificationType=string,ComparisonOperator=string,Threshold=double,ThresholdType=string,NotificationState=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "NotificationType": "ACTUAL"|"FORECASTED",
            "ComparisonOperator": "GREATER_THAN"|"LESS_THAN"|"EQUAL_TO",
            "Threshold": double,
            "ThresholdType": "PERCENTAGE"|"ABSOLUTE_VALUE",
            "NotificationState": "OK"|"ALARM"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve the subscribers for a budget notification

       This  example retrieves the subscribers for a Cost and Usage budget no-
       tification.

       Command:

          aws budgets describe-subscribers-for-notification --account-id 111122223333 --budget-name "Example Budget" --notification NotificationType=ACTUAL,ComparisonOperator=GREATER_THAN,Threshold=80,ThresholdType=PERCENTAGE --max-results 5

       Output:

          {
             "Subscribers": [
                 {
                     "SubscriptionType": "EMAIL",
                     "Address": "example2@example.com"
                 },
                 {
                     "SubscriptionType": "EMAIL",
                     "Address": "example@example.com"
                 }
             ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Subscribers -> (list)
          A list of subscribers that are associated with a notification.

          (structure)
              The subscriber to a budget notification. The subscriber consists
              of  a  subscription  type  and  either an Amazon SNS topic or an
              email address.

              For example, an email subscriber has the following parameters:

              o A subscriptionType of EMAIL

              o An address of example@example.com

              SubscriptionType -> (string)
                 The type of notification that Amazon Web Services sends to  a
                 subscriber.

              Address -> (string)
                 The  address  that Amazon Web Services sends budget notifica-
                 tions to, either an SNS topic or an email.

                 When you create a subscriber, the value of Address can't con-
                 tain line breaks.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token in the service response that indicates the next
          set of results that you can retrieve.
