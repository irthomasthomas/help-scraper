          A list of dial requests.

          (structure)

              attributes -> (map)
                 A custom key-value pair  using  an  attribute  map.  The  at-
                 tributes  are  standard Amazon Connect attributes, and can be
                 accessed in contact flows just like  any  other  contact  at-
                 tributes.

                 key -> (string)
                     The key of the attribute. Attribute keys can include only
                     alphanumeric, dash, and underscore characters.

                 value -> (string)
                     The value of the attribute.

              clientToken -> (string)
                 Client provided parameter used  for  idempotency.  Its  value
                 must be unique for each request.

              expirationTime -> (timestamp)
                 Timestamp with no UTC offset or timezone

              phoneNumber -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attributes={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},clientToken=string,expirationTime=timestamp,phoneNumber=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "attributes": {"string": "string"
                ...},
              "clientToken": "string",
              "expirationTime": timestamp,
              "phoneNumber": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --id (string)
          Identifier representing a Campaign

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
