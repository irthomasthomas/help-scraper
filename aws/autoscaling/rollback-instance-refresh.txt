ROLLBACK-INSTANCE-REFRESH()                        ROLLBACK-INSTANCE-REFRESH()



NAME
       rollback-instance-refresh -

DESCRIPTION
       Cancels  an  instance  refresh  that  is in progress and rolls back any
       changes that it made. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling  replaces  any  instances
       that were replaced during the instance refresh. This restores your Auto
       Scaling group to the configuration that it was using before  the  start
       of the instance refresh.

       This  operation  is  part of the instance refresh feature in Amazon EC2
       Auto Scaling, which helps you update instances  in  your  Auto  Scaling
       group after you make configuration changes.

       A rollback is not supported in the following situations:

       o There is no desired configuration specified for the instance refresh.

       o The  Auto Scaling group has a launch template that uses an Amazon Web
         Services Systems Manager parameter instead of an AMI ID for  the  Im-
         ageId property.

       o The Auto Scaling group uses the launch template's $Latest or $Default
         version.

       When you receive a successful response from this operation, Amazon  EC2
       Auto  Scaling immediately begins replacing instances. You can check the
       status of this operation through the  DescribeInstanceRefreshes API op-
       eration.

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To roll back an instance refresh

       The  following  rollback-instance-refresh   example   rolls   back   an
       in-progress instance refresh for the specified Auto Scaling group.

          aws autoscaling rollback-instance-refresh \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg

       Output:

          {
              "InstanceRefreshId": "08b91cf7-8fa6-48af-b6a6-d227f40f1b9b"
          }

       For  more  information,  see Undo changes with a rollback in the Amazon
       EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.

OUTPUT
       InstanceRefreshId -> (string)
          The instance refresh ID associated with the  request.  This  is  the
          unique ID assigned to the instance refresh when it was started.
