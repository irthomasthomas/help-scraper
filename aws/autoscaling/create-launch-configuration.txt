CREATE-LAUNCH-CONFIGURATION()                    CREATE-LAUNCH-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       create-launch-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a launch configuration.

       If  you  exceed  your  maximum limit of launch configurations, the call
       fails. To query this limit, call the   DescribeAccountLimits  API.  For
       information  about  updating this limit, see Quotas for Amazon EC2 Auto
       Scaling in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

       For more information, see Launch configurations in the Amazon EC2  Auto
       Scaling User Guide .

       NOTE:
          Amazon  EC2 Auto Scaling configures instances launched as part of an
          Auto Scaling group using either a launch template or a  launch  con-
          figuration. We strongly recommend that you do not use launch config-
          urations. They do not provide full functionality for Amazon EC2 Auto
          Scaling or Amazon EC2. For information about using launch templates,
          see Launch templates in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

          Region per account.

       --image-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that was assigned during
          registration. For more information, see Find a Linux AMI in the Ama-
          zon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances .

          If you specify InstanceId , an ImageId is not required.

       --key-name (string)
          The  name  of the key pair. For more information, see Amazon EC2 key
          pairs and Amazon EC2 instances in the  Amazon  EC2  User  Guide  for

          A  list  that  contains  the security group IDs to assign to the in-
          stances in the Auto Scaling group. For more information, see Control
          traffic  to your Amazon Web Services resources using security groups
          in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --classic-link-vpc-id (string)
          Available for backward compatibility.

       --user-data (string)
          The user data to make available to the launched EC2  instances.  For
          more  information,  see  Instance metadata and user data (Linux) and
          Instance metadata and user data (Windows). If you are using  a  com-
          mand  line  tool,  base64-encoding is performed for you, and you can
          load the text from a file. Otherwise, you  must  provide  base64-en-
          coded text. User data is limited to 16 KB.

       --instance-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the instance to use to create the launch configuration.
          The new launch configuration derives attributes from  the  instance,
          except for the block device mapping.

          To  create  a  launch  configuration  with a block device mapping or
          override any other instance attributes, specify them as part of  the
          same request.

          For  more information, see Create a launch configuration in the Ama-
          zon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

       --instance-type (string)
          Specifies the instance type of the  EC2  instance.  For  information
          about  available instance types, see Available instance types in the
          Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances .

          If you specify InstanceId , an InstanceType is not required.

       --kernel-id (string)
          The ID of the kernel associated with the AMI.

          NOTE:
              We recommend that you use PV-GRUB instead  of  kernels  and  RAM
              disks.  For  more  information, see User provided kernels in the
              Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances .

       --ramdisk-id (string)
          The ID of the RAM disk to select.

          NOTE:
              We recommend that you use PV-GRUB instead  of  kernels  and  RAM
              disks.  For  more  information, see User provided kernels in the
              Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances .

       --block-device-mappings (list)
          The block device mapping entries that define the  block  devices  to
          attach  to  the  instances  at launch. By default, the block devices
          specified in the block device mapping for the AMI are used. For more
          information,  see Block device mappings in the Amazon EC2 User Guide
          for Linux Instances .

          (structure)
              Describes a block device mapping.

              VirtualName -> (string)
                 The name of the instance store volume (virtual device) to at-
                 tach  to  an instance at launch. The name must be in the form
                 ephemeral*X* where X is a number starting from zero (0),  for
                 example, ephemeral0 .

              DeviceName -> (string)
                 The device name assigned to the volume (for example, /dev/sdh
                 or xvdh ). For more information, see Device naming  on  Linux
                 instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances .

                 NOTE:
                     To define a block device mapping, set the device name and
                     exactly one of the following properties: Ebs , NoDevice ,
                     or VirtualName .

              Ebs -> (structure)
                 Information to attach an EBS volume to an instance at launch.

                 SnapshotId -> (string)
                     The snapshot ID of the volume to use.

                     You must specify either a VolumeSize or a SnapshotId .

                 VolumeSize -> (integer)
                     The volume size, in GiBs. The following are the supported
                     volumes sizes for each volume type:

                     o gp2 and gp3 : 1-16,384

                     o io1 : 4-16,384

                     o st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384

                     o standard : 1-1,024

                     You must specify either a SnapshotId or a VolumeSize . If
                     you  specify  both SnapshotId and VolumeSize , the volume
                     size must be equal or greater than the size of the  snap-
                     shot.

                 VolumeType -> (string)
                     The  volume  type.  For  more information, see Amazon EBS
                     volume types in the Amazon EBS User Guide .

                     Valid values: standard | io1 | gp2 | st1 | sc1 | gp3

                 DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether the volume is deleted on instance  ter-
                     mination.  For Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, the default value
                     is true .

                 Iops -> (integer)
                     The number of input/output (I/O)  operations  per  second
                     (IOPS)  to provision for the volume. For gp3 and io1 vol-
                     umes, this represents the number of IOPS that are  provi-
                     sioned  for  the volume. For gp2 volumes, this represents
                     the baseline performance of the volume and  the  rate  at
                     which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

                     The  following  are  the supported values for each volume
                     type:

                     o gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS

                     o io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                     For io1  volumes,  we  guarantee  64,000  IOPS  only  for
                     Instances built on the Amazon Web Services Nitro System .
                     Other  instance  families  guarantee  performance  up  to
                     32,000 IOPS.
                        Iops  is  supported when the volume type is gp3 or io1
                        and required only when the volume type is io1  .  (Not
                        used with standard , gp2 , st1 , or sc1 volumes.)

                 Encrypted -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  the  volume  should be encrypted. En-
                     crypted EBS volumes can only  be  attached  to  instances
                     that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information,
                     see Requirements for Amazon EBS encryption in the  Amazon
                     EBS  User Guide . If your AMI uses encrypted volumes, you
                     can also only launch it on supported instance types.

                     NOTE:
                        If you are creating a volume from a snapshot, you can-
                        not  create  an  unencrypted  volume from an encrypted
                        snapshot. Also, you cannot specify a KMS key  ID  when
                        using a launch configuration.

                        If  you  enable encryption by default, the EBS volumes
                        that you create are always encrypted, either using the
                        Amazon Web Services managed KMS key or a customer-man-
                        aged KMS key, regardless of whether the  snapshot  was
                        encrypted.

                        For  more information, see Use Amazon Web Services KMS
                        keys to encrypt Amazon EBS volumes in the  Amazon  EC2
                        Auto Scaling User Guide .

                 Throughput -> (integer)
                     The throughput (MiBps) to provision for a gp3 volume.

              NoDevice -> (boolean)
                 Setting this value to true prevents a volume that is included
                 in the block device mapping of the AMI from being  mapped  to
                 the specified device name at launch.

                 If NoDevice is true for the root device, instances might fail
                 the EC2 health check. In that case, Amazon EC2  Auto  Scaling
                 launches replacement instances.

            }
            ...
          ]

       --instance-monitoring (structure)
          Controls  whether instances in this group are launched with detailed
          (true ) or basic (false ) monitoring.

          The default value is true (enabled).

          WARNING:
              When detailed monitoring is enabled, Amazon CloudWatch generates
              metrics every minute and your account is charged a fee. When you
              disable detailed monitoring, CloudWatch generates metrics  every
              5  minutes.  For  more information, see Configure monitoring for
              Auto Scaling instances in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide
              .

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              If true , detailed monitoring is enabled. Otherwise, basic moni-
              toring is enabled.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Enabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Enabled": true|false
          }

       --spot-price (string)
          The maximum hourly price to be paid for any Spot  Instance  launched
          to  fulfill  the request. Spot Instances are launched when the price
          you specify exceeds the current Spot price.  For  more  information,
          see  Request Spot Instances for fault-tolerant and flexible applica-
          tions in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

          Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.001

          NOTE:
              When you change your maximum price by creating a new launch con-
              figuration,  running  instances  will continue to run as long as
              the maximum price for those running instances is higher than the
              current Spot price.

       --iam-instance-profile (string)
          The  name  or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance profile
          associated with the IAM role for the instance. The instance  profile
          contains the IAM role. For more information, see IAM role for appli-
          cations that run on Amazon EC2 instances  in  the  Amazon  EC2  Auto
          Scaling User Guide .

       --ebs-optimized | --no-ebs-optimized (boolean)
          Specifies  whether the launch configuration is optimized for EBS I/O
          (true )  or  not  (false  ).  The  optimization  provides  dedicated
          throughput  to  Amazon  EBS  and an optimized configuration stack to
          provide optimal I/O performance. This optimization is not  available
          with  all  instance types. Additional fees are incurred when you en-
          able EBS optimization for an instance type that is not EBS-optimized
          by default. For more information, see Amazon EBS-optimized instances
          in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances .

          The default value is false .

       --associate-public-ip-address | --no-associate-public-ip-address (bool-
       ean)
          Specifies whether to assign a public IPv4 address to the group's in-
          stances. If the instance is launched into a default subnet, the  de-
          fault  is  to  assign a public IPv4 address, unless you disabled the
          option to assign a public IPv4 address on the  subnet.  If  the  in-
          stance  is  launched into a nondefault subnet, the default is not to
          assign a public IPv4 address, unless you enabled the option  to  as-
          sign a public IPv4 address on the subnet.

          If  you  specify  true , each instance in the Auto Scaling group re-
          ceives a unique public  IPv4  address.  For  more  information,  see
          Provide  network  connectivity for your Auto Scaling instances using
          Amazon VPC in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

          If you specify this property, you must specify at least  one  subnet
          for VPCZoneIdentifier when you create your group.

       --placement-tenancy (string)
          The  tenancy  of  the instance, either default or dedicated . An in-
          stance with dedicated tenancy runs on isolated, single-tenant  hard-
          ware  and  can  only be launched into a VPC. To launch dedicated in-
          stances into a shared tenancy VPC (a VPC with the instance placement
          tenancy  attribute  set to default ), you must set the value of this
          property to dedicated .

          If you specify PlacementTenancy , you must specify at least one sub-
          net for VPCZoneIdentifier when you create your group.

          Valid values: default | dedicated

       --metadata-options (structure)
          The  metadata  options  for the instances. For more information, see
          Configure the instance metadata options in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scal-
          ing User Guide .

          HttpTokens -> (string)
              The state of token usage for your instance metadata requests. If
              the parameter is not specified in the request, the default state
              is optional .

              If  the  state is optional , you can choose to retrieve instance
              metadata with or without a signed token header on your  request.
              If  you  retrieve  the IAM role credentials without a token, the
              version 1.0 role credentials are returned. If you  retrieve  the
              IAM role credentials using a valid signed token, the version 2.0
              role credentials are returned.

              If the state is required , you must send a signed  token  header
              with  any  instance  metadata retrieval requests. In this state,
              retrieving the IAM role credentials always returns  the  version
              2.0 credentials; the version 1.0 credentials are not available.

          HttpPutResponseHopLimit -> (integer)
              The  desired  HTTP  PUT response hop limit for instance metadata
              requests. The larger the number, the further  instance  metadata
              requests can travel.

              Default: 1

          HttpEndpoint -> (string)
              This parameter enables or disables the HTTP metadata endpoint on
              your instances. If the parameter is not specified,  the  default
              state is enabled .

              NOTE:
                 If  you specify a value of disabled , you will not be able to
                 access your instance metadata.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          HttpTokens=string,HttpPutResponseHopLimit=integer,HttpEndpoint=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.
