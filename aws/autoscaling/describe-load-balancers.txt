DESCRIBE-LOAD-BALANCERS()                            DESCRIBE-LOAD-BALANCERS()



NAME
       describe-load-balancers -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  API  call  has  been replaced with a new "traffic sources" API
          call (DescribeTrafficSources ) that can  describe  multiple  traffic
          sources  types. While we continue to support DescribeLoadBalancers ,
          and you can use both the original DescribeLoadBalancers API call and
          the  new  DescribeTrafficSources  API  call on the same Auto Scaling
          group, we recommend using the new "traffic sources" API call to sim-
          plify how you manage traffic sources.

       Gets  information about the load balancers for the specified Auto Scal-
       ing group.

       This operation describes only Classic Load Balancers. If you  have  Ap-
       plication  Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, or Gateway Load Bal-
       ancers, use the  DescribeLoadBalancerTargetGroups API instead.

       To determine the attachment status of the load balancer, use the  State
       element  in  the  response.  When you attach a load balancer to an Auto
       Scaling group, the initial State value is Adding .  The  state  transi-
       tions to Added after all Auto Scaling instances are registered with the
       load balancer. If Elastic Load Balancing health checks are enabled  for
       the  Auto  Scaling  group,  the state transitions to InService after at
       least one Auto Scaling instance passes the health check. When the  load
       balancer  is in the InService state, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can termi-
       nate and replace any instances that are reported as  unhealthy.  If  no
       registered  instances pass the health checks, the load balancer doesn't
       enter the InService state.

       Load balancers also have an InService state if you attach them  in  the
       CreateAutoScalingGroup  API call. If your load balancer state is InSer-
       vice , but it is not working properly, check the scaling activities  by
       calling  DescribeScalingActivities and take any corrective actions nec-
       essary.

       For help with failed health checks, see Troubleshooting Amazon EC2 Auto
       Scaling:  Health checks in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide . For
       more information, see Use Elastic Load Balancing to distribute  traffic
       across  the instances in your Auto Scaling group in the Amazon EC2 Auto
       Scaling User Guide .

       describe-load-balancers is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: LoadBalancers

SYNOPSIS
            describe-load-balancers
          --auto-scaling-group-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe the Classic Load Balancers for an Auto Scaling group

       This example describes the Classic Load  Balancers  for  the  specified
       Auto Scaling group.

          aws autoscaling describe-load-balancers \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg

       Output:

          {
              "LoadBalancers": [
                  {
                      "State": "Added",
                      "LoadBalancerName": "my-load-balancer"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       LoadBalancers -> (list)
          The load balancers.

          (structure)
              Describes the state of a Classic Load Balancer.

              LoadBalancerName -> (string)
                 The name of the load balancer.

              State -> (string)
                 One of the following load balancer states:

                 o Adding  -  The  Auto Scaling instances are being registered
                   with the load balancer.

                 o Added - All Auto Scaling instances are registered with  the
                   load balancer.

                 o InService  -  At  least one Auto Scaling instance passed an
                   ELB health check.

                 o Removing - The Auto Scaling instances  are  being  deregis-
                   tered from the load balancer. If connection draining is en-
                   abled, Elastic Load Balancing waits for in-flight  requests
                   to complete before deregistering the instances.

                 o Removed  - All Auto Scaling instances are deregistered from
                   the load balancer.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A string that indicates that the response contains more  items  than
          can  be  returned in a single response. To receive additional items,
          specify this string for the NextToken value when requesting the next
          set of items. This value is null when there are no more items to re-
          turn.
