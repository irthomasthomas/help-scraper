DESCRIBE-LIFECYCLE-HOOKS()                          DESCRIBE-LIFECYCLE-HOOKS()



NAME
       describe-lifecycle-hooks -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about the lifecycle hooks for the specified Auto Scal-
       ing group.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-lifecycle-hooks
          --auto-scaling-group-name <value>
          [--lifecycle-hook-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --lifecycle-hook-names (list)
          The names of one or more lifecycle hooks. If you omit  this  parame-
          ter, all lifecycle hooks are described.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe your lifecycle hooks

       This example describes the lifecycle hooks for the specified Auto Scal-
       ing group.

          aws autoscaling describe-lifecycle-hooks \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg

       Output:

          {
              "LifecycleHooks": [
                  {
                      "GlobalTimeout": 3000,
                      "HeartbeatTimeout": 30,

                      "LifecycleTransition": "autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_LAUNCHING"
                  },

                      "LifecycleTransition": "autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_TERMINATING"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       LifecycleHooks -> (list)
          The lifecycle hooks for the specified group.

          (structure)
              Describes a lifecycle hook. A lifecycle hook lets you create so-
              lutions  that  are  aware of events in the Auto Scaling instance
              lifecycle, and then perform a custom action  on  instances  when
              the corresponding lifecycle event occurs.

              LifecycleHookName -> (string)
                 The name of the lifecycle hook.

              AutoScalingGroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the Auto Scaling group for the lifecycle hook.

              LifecycleTransition -> (string)
                 The  state of the EC2 instance to which to attach the lifecy-
                 cle hook. The following are possible values:

                 o autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_LAUNCHING

                 o autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_TERMINATING

              NotificationTargetARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of the target that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling sends  no-
                 tifications  to  when  an instance is in the transition state
                 for the lifecycle hook. The notification target can be either
                 an SQS queue or an SNS topic.

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of the IAM role that allows the Auto Scaling group to
                 publish to the specified notification target (an  Amazon  SNS
                 topic or an Amazon SQS queue).

              NotificationMetadata -> (string)
                 Additional  information  that is included any time Amazon EC2
                 Auto Scaling sends a message to the notification target.

              HeartbeatTimeout -> (integer)
                 The maximum time, in seconds,  that  can  elapse  before  the
                 lifecycle  hook  times  out. If the lifecycle hook times out,
                 Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling performs the action that  you  speci-
                 fied in the DefaultResult parameter.

              GlobalTimeout -> (integer)
                 The  maximum time, in seconds, that an instance can remain in
                 a wait state. The maximum is 172800 seconds (48 hours) or 100
                 times HeartbeatTimeout , whichever is smaller.

              DefaultResult -> (string)
                 Defines  the  action  the Auto Scaling group should take when
                 the lifecycle hook timeout elapses or if an unexpected  fail-
                 ure occurs. The possible values are CONTINUE and ABANDON .
