NAME
       describe-warm-pool -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a warm pool and its instances.

       For more information, see Warm pools for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling in the
       Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-warm-pool is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Instances

SYNOPSIS
            describe-warm-pool
          --auto-scaling-group-name <value>

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 means that the instance is healthy and should remain in  ser-
                 vice. Unhealthy means that the instance is unhealthy and that
                 Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling should terminate and replace it.

              LaunchConfigurationName -> (string)
                 The launch configuration associated with the instance.

              LaunchTemplate -> (structure)

                 LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
                     The ID of the launch template. To get  the  template  ID,
                     use the Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplates API operation.
                     New launch templates can be created using the Amazon  EC2
                     CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                     Conditional:  You  must specify either a LaunchTemplateId
                     or a LaunchTemplateName .

                 LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
                     The name of the launch  template.  To  get  the  template
                     name,  use the Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplates API op-
                     eration. New launch templates can be  created  using  the
                     Amazon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                     Conditional:  You  must specify either a LaunchTemplateId
                     or a LaunchTemplateName .

                 Version -> (string)
                     The version number, $Latest , or $Default .  To  get  the

                     DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions API operation. New  launch
                     template  versions  can  be  created using the Amazon EC2
                     CreateLaunchTemplateVersion API. If the value is  $Latest
                     ,  Amazon  EC2 Auto Scaling selects the latest version of
                     the launch template  when  launching  instances.  If  the
                     value  is  $Default , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects the
                     default version of the launch template when launching in-
                     stances. The default value is $Default .

                 Indicates  whether the instance is protected from termination
                 by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling when scaling in.

                 The number of capacity  units  contributed  by  the  instance
                 based on its instance type.

                 Valid Range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 999.

       NextToken -> (string)
          This string indicates that the response contains more items than can
          be returned in a single response. To receive additional items, spec-
          ify this string for the NextToken value when requesting the next set
          of items. This value is null when there are no more items to return.
