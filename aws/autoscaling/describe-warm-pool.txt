OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --max-records (integer)
          The maximum number of instances to return with this call. The  maxi-
          mum value is 50 .

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  for  the  next set of instances to return. (You received
          this token from a previous call.)

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 means that the instance is healthy and should remain in  ser-
                 vice.  "Unhealthy"  means  that the instance is unhealthy and
                 that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling should terminate and replace it.

                 The launch configuration associated with the instance.

              LaunchTemplate -> (structure)

                 LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
                     The ID of the launch template. To get  the  template  ID,
                     use the Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplates API operation.
                     New launch templates can be created using the Amazon  EC2
                     CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                     Conditional:  You  must specify either a LaunchTemplateId
                     or a LaunchTemplateName .

                 LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
                     The name of the launch  template.  To  get  the  template
                     name,  use the Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplates API op-
                     eration. New launch templates can be  created  using  the
                     Amazon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                     Conditional:  You  must specify either a LaunchTemplateId
                     or a LaunchTemplateName .

                 Version -> (string)

                     DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions API operation. New  launch
                     template  versions  can  be  created using the Amazon EC2
                     CreateLaunchTemplateVersion API. If the value is  $Latest
                     ,  Amazon  EC2 Auto Scaling selects the latest version of
                     the launch template  when  launching  instances.  If  the
                     value  is  $Default , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects the
                     default version of the launch template when launching in-
                     stances. The default value is $Default .

                 Indicates  whether the instance is protected from termination
                 by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling when scaling in.

                 The number of capacity  units  contributed  by  the  instance
                 based on its instance type.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  for  the next set of items to return. (You received this
          token from a previous call.)
