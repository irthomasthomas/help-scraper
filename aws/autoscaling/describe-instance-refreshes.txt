DESCRIBE-INSTANCE-REFRESHES()                    DESCRIBE-INSTANCE-REFRESHES()



NAME
       describe-instance-refreshes -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information  about  the instance refreshes for the specified Auto
       Scaling group.

       This operation is part of the instance refresh feature  in  Amazon  EC2
       Auto  Scaling,  which  helps  you update instances in your Auto Scaling
       group after you make configuration changes.

       To help you determine the status of an instance refresh, this operation
       returns  information about the instance refreshes you previously initi-
       ated, including their status, end time, the percentage of the  instance
       refresh  that is complete, and the number of instances remaining to up-
       date before the instance refresh is complete.

       The following are the possible statuses:

       o Pending - The request was created, but the operation has not started.

       o InProgress - The operation is in progress.

       o Successful - The operation completed successfully.

       o Failed - The operation failed to complete. You can troubleshoot using
         the status reason and the scaling activities.

       o Cancelling  -  An  ongoing operation is being cancelled. Cancellation
         does not roll back any replacements that have already been completed,
         but it prevents new replacements from being started.

       o Cancelled - The operation is cancelled.

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --instance-refresh-ids (list)
          One or more instance refresh IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  for  the next set of items to return. (You received this
          token from a previous call.)

       --max-records (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return with this  call.  The  default
          value is 50 and the maximum value is 100 .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list instance refreshes

       The following describe-instance-refreshes example returns a description
       of all instance refresh requests for the specified Auto Scaling  group,
       including the status message and (if available) the status reason.

          aws autoscaling describe-instance-refreshes \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg

OUTPUT
       InstanceRefreshes -> (list)
          The instance refreshes for the specified group, sorted  by  creation
          timestamp in descending order.

          (structure)
              Describes an instance refresh for an Auto Scaling group.

              InstanceRefreshId -> (string)
                 The instance refresh ID.

              AutoScalingGroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the Auto Scaling group.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status for the instance refresh operation:

                 o Pending  -  The  request was created, but the operation has
                   not started.

                 o InProgress - The operation is in progress.

                 o Successful - The operation completed successfully.

                 o Failed - The operation failed to complete.  You  can  trou-
                   bleshoot  using  the  status reason and the scaling activi-
                   ties.

                 o Cancelling - An ongoing operation is being cancelled.  Can-
                   cellation does not roll back any replacements that have al-
                   ready been completed, but it prevents new replacements from
                   being started.

                 o Cancelled - The operation is cancelled.

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 Provides  more  details  about  the current status of the in-
                 stance refresh.

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time at which the instance refresh began.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time at which the instance refresh ended.

              PercentageComplete -> (integer)
                 The percentage of the instance refresh that is complete.  For
                 each instance replacement, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling tracks the
                 instance's health status  and  warm-up  time.  When  the  in-
                 stance's  health  status changes to healthy and the specified
                 warm-up time passes, the instance is considered  updated  and
                 is added to the percentage complete.

              InstancesToUpdate -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  instances remaining to update before the in-
                 stance refresh is complete.

              ProgressDetails -> (structure)
                 Additional progress details for an Auto  Scaling  group  that
                 has a warm pool.

                 LivePoolProgress -> (structure)
                     Indicates  the  progress  of  an  instance refresh on in-
                     stances that are in the Auto Scaling group.

                     PercentageComplete -> (integer)
                        The percentage of instances in the Auto Scaling  group
                        that  have  been  replaced. For each instance replace-
                        ment, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling  tracks  the  instance's
                        health  status  and  warm-up time. When the instance's
                        health status changes to  healthy  and  the  specified
                        warm-up  time  passes,  the instance is considered up-
                        dated and is added to the percentage complete.

                     InstancesToUpdate -> (integer)
                        The number of instances remaining to update.

                 WarmPoolProgress -> (structure)
                     Indicates the progress of  an  instance  refresh  on  in-
                     stances that are in the warm pool.

                     PercentageComplete -> (integer)
                        The percentage of instances in the warm pool that have
                        been replaced. For each instance  replacement,  Amazon
                        EC2  Auto  Scaling tracks the instance's health status
                        and warm-up time. When the  instance's  health  status
                        changes  to  healthy  and  the  specified warm-up time
                        passes, the instance  is  considered  updated  and  is
                        added to the percentage complete.

                     InstancesToUpdate -> (integer)
                        The number of instances remaining to update.

              Preferences -> (structure)
                 Describes the preferences for an instance refresh.

                 MinHealthyPercentage -> (integer)
                     The  amount  of  capacity  in the Auto Scaling group that
                     must pass your group's health checks to allow the  opera-
                     tion  to continue. The value is expressed as a percentage
                     of  the  desired  capacity  of  the  Auto  Scaling  group
                     (rounded up to the nearest integer). The default is 90 .

                     Setting  the  minimum  healthy  percentage to 100 percent
                     limits the rate of replacement to one instance at a time.
                     In  contrast,  setting  it to 0 percent has the effect of
                     replacing all instances at the same time.

                 InstanceWarmup -> (integer)
                        Not needed if the default instance warmup  is  defined
                        for the group.

                     The duration of the instance warmup, in seconds.

                     NOTE:
                        The  default  is  to use the value for the default in-
                        stance warmup defined for the group.  If  default  in-
                        stance  warmup is null, then InstanceWarmup falls back
                        to the value of the health check grace period.

                 CheckpointPercentages -> (list)
                     Threshold values for each checkpoint in ascending  order.
                     Each  number  must be unique. To replace all instances in
                     the Auto Scaling group, the last number in the array must
                     be 100 .

                     For usage examples, see Adding checkpoints to an instance
                     refresh in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

                     (integer)

                 CheckpointDelay -> (integer)
                     The amount of time, in seconds, to wait  after  a  check-
                     point  before  continuing. This property is optional, but
                     if you specify a value for it, you must  also  specify  a
                     value  for CheckpointPercentages . If you specify a value
                     for CheckpointPercentages and not for  CheckpointDelay  ,
                     the CheckpointDelay defaults to 3600 (1 hour).

                 SkipMatching -> (boolean)
                     A  boolean  value that indicates whether skip matching is
                     enabled. If true, then Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling skips  re-
                     placing  instances  that match the desired configuration.
                     If no desired configuration is specified, then  it  skips
                     replacing instances that have the same configuration that
                     is already set on the group. The default is false .

              DesiredConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Describes the specific update you want to deploy.

                 LaunchTemplate -> (structure)
                     Describes the launch template  and  the  version  of  the
                     launch  template  that  Amazon  EC2  Auto Scaling uses to
                     launch Amazon EC2 instances. For more  information  about
                     launch  templates, see Launch templates in the Amazon EC2
                     Auto Scaling User Guide .

                     LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
                        The ID of the launch template. To get the template ID,
                        use  the Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplates API opera-
                        tion. New launch templates can be  created  using  the
                        Amazon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                        Conditional:  You  must  specify  either  a LaunchTem-
                        plateId or a LaunchTemplateName .

                     LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
                        The name of the launch template. To get  the  template
                        name,  use  the Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplates API
                        operation. New launch templates can be  created  using
                        the Amazon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                        Conditional:  You  must  specify  either  a LaunchTem-
                        plateId or a LaunchTemplateName .

                     Version -> (string)
                        The version number, $Latest , or $Default . To get the
                        version     number,     use     the     Amazon     EC2
                        DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions  API   operation.   New
                        launch template versions can be created using the Ama-
                        zon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplateVersion API. If the  value
                        is  $Latest , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects the lat-
                        est version of the launch template when launching  in-
                        stances.  If  the  value is $Default , Amazon EC2 Auto
                        Scaling selects the default version of the launch tem-
                        plate  when  launching instances. The default value is
                        $Default .

                 MixedInstancesPolicy -> (structure)
                     Use this structure to launch multiple instance types  and
                     On-Demand  Instances  and  Spot Instances within a single
                     Auto Scaling group.

                     A mixed instances policy contains information that Amazon
                     EC2 Auto Scaling can use to launch instances and help op-
                     timize your costs. For more information, see Auto Scaling
                     groups  with multiple instance types and purchase options
                     in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

                     LaunchTemplate -> (structure)
                        One or more launch templates and  the  instance  types
                        (overrides)  that  are used to launch EC2 instances to
                        fulfill On-Demand and Spot capacities.

                        LaunchTemplateSpecification -> (structure)
                            The launch template.

                            LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
                               The ID of the launch template. To get the  tem-
                               plate     ID,     use     the     Amazon    EC2
                               DescribeLaunchTemplates  API   operation.   New
                               launch  templates can be created using the Ama-
                               zon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                               Conditional:  You   must   specify   either   a
                               LaunchTemplateId or a LaunchTemplateName .

                            LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
                               The  name  of  the  launch template. To get the
                               template   name,    use    the    Amazon    EC2
                               DescribeLaunchTemplates   API   operation.  New
                               launch templates can be created using the  Ama-
                               zon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                               Conditional:   You   must   specify   either  a
                               LaunchTemplateId or a LaunchTemplateName .

                            Version -> (string)
                               The version number, $Latest , or $Default .  To
                               get  the  version  number,  use  the Amazon EC2
                               DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions  API  operation.
                               New launch template versions can be created us-
                               ing the Amazon EC2  CreateLaunchTemplateVersion
                               API.  If the value is $Latest , Amazon EC2 Auto
                               Scaling  selects  the  latest  version  of  the
                               launch  template  when  launching instances. If
                               the value is $Default , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
                               selects  the default version of the launch tem-
                               plate when  launching  instances.  The  default
                               value is $Default .

                        Overrides -> (list)
                            Any  properties that you specify override the same
                            properties in the launch template.

                            (structure)
                               Use this structure to let Amazon EC2 Auto Scal-
                               ing  do  the  following  when  the Auto Scaling
                               group has a mixed instances policy:

                               o Override the instance type that is  specified
                                 in the launch template.

                               o Use multiple instance types.

                               Specify  the  instance  types that you want, or
                               define your instance requirements  instead  and
                               let  Amazon  EC2  Auto  Scaling  provision  the
                               available instance types  that  meet  your  re-
                               quirements.  This  can  provide Amazon EC2 Auto
                               Scaling with a  larger  selection  of  instance
                               types  to  choose from when fulfilling Spot and
                               On-Demand capacities. You can  view  which  in-
                               stance  types  are matched before you apply the
                               instance  requirements  to  your  Auto  Scaling
                               group.

                               After  you  define  your instance requirements,
                               you don't have to keep updating these  settings
                               to  get  new  EC2 instance types automatically.
                               Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses the  instance  re-
                               quirements  of the Auto Scaling group to deter-
                               mine whether a new EC2  instance  type  can  be
                               used.

                               InstanceType -> (string)
                                   The  instance type, such as m3.xlarge . You
                                   must specify an instance type that is  sup-
                                   ported  in your requested Region and Avail-
                                   ability Zones. For  more  information,  see
                                   Instance  types  in the Amazon Elastic Com-
                                   pute Cloud User Guide .

                                   You can specify up to 40 instance types per
                                   Auto Scaling group.

                               WeightedCapacity -> (string)
                                   If  you provide a list of instance types to
                                   use, you can specify the number of capacity
                                   units  provided  by  each  instance type in
                                   terms of  virtual  CPUs,  memory,  storage,
                                   throughput,  or  other relative performance
                                   characteristic. When a  Spot  or  On-Demand
                                   Instance  is  launched,  the capacity units
                                   count toward the desired  capacity.  Amazon
                                   EC2  Auto  Scaling launches instances until
                                   the desired capacity is totally  fulfilled,
                                   even if this results in an overage. For ex-
                                   ample, if there are two units remaining  to
                                   fulfill capacity, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scal-
                                   ing can only  launch  an  instance  with  a
                                   WeightedCapacity  of  five  units,  the in-
                                   stance is launched, and the desired  capac-
                                   ity  is  exceeded  by three units. For more

                                   the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling  User  Guide  .
                                   Value must be in the range of 1999.

                                   If you specify a value for WeightedCapacity
                                   for one instance type, you must  specify  a
                                   value for WeightedCapacity for all of them.

                                   WARNING:
                                      Every  Auto Scaling group has three size
                                      parameters (DesiredCapacity , MaxSize  ,
                                      and  MinSize  ).  Usually, you set these
                                      sizes based on a specific number of  in-
                                      stances.  However,  if  you  configure a
                                      mixed  instances  policy  that   defines
                                      weights for the instance types, you must
                                      specify these sizes with the same  units
                                      that you use for weighting instances.

                               LaunchTemplateSpecification -> (structure)

                                   types might require a launch template  with
                                   a  different  AMI.  If not provided, Amazon
                                   EC2 Auto Scaling uses the  launch  template
                                   that's specified in the LaunchTemplate def-

                                   the LaunchTemplate definition count towards
                                   this limit.

                                   LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
                                      The  ID  of  the launch template. To get
                                      the template  ID,  use  the  Amazon  EC2
                                      DescribeLaunchTemplates  API  operation.

                                   Version -> (string)
                                      The  version  number,  $Latest , or $De-
                                      fault . To get the version  number,  use
                                      the              Amazon              EC2

                                      ation.  New launch template versions can
                                      be  created   using   the   Amazon   EC2
                                      CreateLaunchTemplateVersion  API. If the
                                      value is $Latest , Amazon EC2 Auto Scal-
                                      ing  selects  the  latest version of the
                                      launch  template  when   launching   in-
                                      stances. If the value is $Default , Ama-
                                      zon EC2 Auto Scaling selects the default
                                      version  of  the  launch  template  when
                                      launching instances. The  default  value
                                      is $Default .

                               InstanceRequirements -> (structure)
                                   The  instance requirements. Amazon EC2 Auto
                                   Scaling uses your specified requirements to
                                   identify instance types. Then, it uses your
                                   On-Demand and Spot allocation strategies to
                                   launch instances from these instance types.

                                   You can specify up to four separate sets of
                                   instance  requirements  per  Auto   Scaling
                                   group.  This is useful for provisioning in-
                                   stances from different Amazon  Machine  Im-
                                   ages (AMIs) in the same Auto Scaling group.
                                   To do this, create the AMIs  and  create  a
                                   new  launch  template  for  each AMI. Then,
                                   create a compatible  set  of  instance  re-
                                   quirements for each launch template.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If  you  specify  InstanceRequirements ,
                                      you can't specify InstanceType .

                                   VCpuCount -> (structure)
                                      The minimum and maximum number of  vCPUs
                                      for an instance type.

                                      Min -> (integer)
                                          The minimum number of vCPUs.

                                      Max -> (integer)
                                          The maximum number of vCPUs.

                                      m5.8xlarge , c5*.* , m5a.* , r* , *3* .

                                      For  example,  if  you specify c5* , you
                                      are excluding  the  entire  C5  instance
                                      family,  which  includes all C5a and C5n
                                      instance types. If you specify  m5a.*  ,
                                      Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will exclude all
                                      the M5a instance types, but not the  M5n
                                      instance types.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If you specify ExcludedInstanceTypes
                                          , you can't specify AllowedInstance-

                                      type  with  your  specified  attributes.
                                      When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects in-
                                      stance types with  your  attributes,  we
                                      will  exclude instance types whose price
                                      is higher than your threshold.  The  pa-
                                      rameter accepts an integer, which Amazon
                                      EC2 Auto Scaling interprets  as  a  per-
                                      centage.  To  turn off price protection,
                                      specify a high value, such as 999999 .

                                      If you set DesiredCapacityType  to  vcpu
                                      or  memory-mib  ,  the  price protection
                                      threshold is applied based  on  the  per
                                      vCPU  or per memory price instead of the
                                      per instance price.

                                      attributes. When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
                                      selects instance  types  with  your  at-
                                      tributes, we will exclude instance types
                                      whose price is higher than your  thresh-
                                      old.  The  parameter accepts an integer,
                                      which Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling interprets
                                      as  a percentage. To turn off price pro-
                                      tection, specify a high value,  such  as
                                      999999 .

                                      If  you  set DesiredCapacityType to vcpu

                                      threshold  is  applied  based on the per
                                      vCPU or per memory price instead of  the

                                   AllowedInstanceTypes -> (list)

                                      fied attributes against. All  other  in-
                                      stance  types  are ignored, even if they
                                      match your specified attributes.

                                      You can use strings  with  one  or  more
                                      wild  cards,  represented by an asterisk
                                      (* ), to allow an instance  type,  size,
                                      or  generation.  The following are exam-
                                      ples: m5.8xlarge , c5*.* , m5a.* , r*  ,
                                      *3* .

                                      For example, if you specify c5* , Amazon
                                      EC2 Auto Scaling will allow  the  entire
                                      C5  instance  family, which includes all
                                      C5a and C5n instance types. If you spec-
                                      ify m5a.* , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will
                                      allow all the M5a  instance  types,  but
                                      not the M5n instance types.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  you specify AllowedInstanceTypes
                                          ,  you  can't  specify   ExcludedIn-

                        The instances distribution.

                        OnDemandAllocationStrategy -> (string)
                            The allocation strategy to apply to your On-Demand
                            Instances when they  are  launched.  Possible  in-
                            stance types are determined by the launch template
                            overrides that you specify.

                            The following lists the valid values:
                               lowest-price

                            Uses price to determine which instance  types  are
                            the  highest priority, launching the lowest priced
                            instance types within an Availability Zone  first.
                            This  is the default value for Auto Scaling groups
                            that specify  InstanceRequirements .
                               prioritized

                            You set the order of instance types for the launch
                            template overrides from highest to lowest priority
                            (from first to last in the list). Amazon EC2  Auto
                            Scaling  launches  your  highest priority instance
                            types first. If all your On-Demand capacity cannot
                            be  fulfilled using your highest priority instance
                            type, then Amazon EC2 Auto  Scaling  launches  the
                            remaining  capacity  using the second priority in-
                            stance type, and so on. This is the default  value
                            for  Auto  Scaling  groups that don't specify  In-
                            stanceRequirements and cannot be used  for  groups
                            that do.

                        OnDemandBaseCapacity -> (integer)
                            The minimum amount of the Auto Scaling group's ca-
                            pacity that must be  fulfilled  by  On-Demand  In-
                            stances.  This  base  portion is launched first as
                            your group scales.

                            This number has the same unit  of  measurement  as
                            the  group's  desired  capacity. If you change the
                            default unit of measurement (number of  instances)
                            by  specifying  weighted  capacity  values in your
                            launch template overrides list, or by changing the
                            default  desired  capacity  type  setting  of  the
                            group, you must specify this number using the same
                            unit of measurement.

                            Default: 0

                        OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity -> (integer)
                            Controls  the  percentages  of On-Demand Instances
                            and Spot Instances for  your  additional  capacity
                            beyond  OnDemandBaseCapacity . Expressed as a num-
                            ber (for example, 20 specifies 20%  On-Demand  In-
                            stances,  80% Spot Instances). If set to 100, only
                            On-Demand Instances are used.

                            Default: 100

                        SpotAllocationStrategy -> (string)
                            The allocation strategy to apply to your Spot  In-
                            stances  when they are launched. Possible instance
                            types are determined by the launch template  over-
                            rides that you specify.

                            The following lists the valid values:
                               capacity-optimized

                            Requests Spot Instances using pools that are opti-
                            mally chosen based on the available Spot capacity.
                            This strategy has the lowest risk of interruption.
                            To give certain instance types a higher chance  of
                            launching  first,  use  capacity-optimized-priori-
                            tized .
                               capacity-optimized-prioritized

                            You set the order of instance types for the launch
                            template overrides from highest to lowest priority
                            (from first to last in the list). Amazon EC2  Auto
                            Scaling  honors  the instance type priorities on a
                            best  effort  basis  but  optimizes  for  capacity
                            first.  Note  that  if  the  On-Demand  allocation
                            strategy is set to prioritized , the same priority
                            is  applied  when  fulfilling  On-Demand capacity.
                            This is not a valid value for Auto Scaling  groups
                            that specify  InstanceRequirements .
                               lowest-price

                            Requests  Spot  Instances  using the lowest priced
                            pools within an Availability Zone, across the num-
                            ber of Spot pools that you specify for the SpotIn-
                            stancePools property. To ensure that your  desired
                            capacity  is met, you might receive Spot Instances
                            from several pools. This is the default value, but
                            it  might  lead to high interruption rates because
                            this strategy only considers  instance  price  and
                            not available capacity.

                            Amazon  EC2 Auto Scaling identifies the pools with
                            the highest capacity availability for  the  number
                            of  instances  that are launching. This means that
                            we will request Spot Instances from the pools that
                            we  believe have the lowest chance of interruption
                            in the near term. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling then re-
                            quests  Spot  Instances  from the lowest priced of
                            these pools.

                        SpotInstancePools -> (integer)
                            The number of Spot Instance pools across which  to
                            allocate  your  Spot Instances. The Spot pools are
                            determined from the different  instance  types  in
                            the overrides. Valid only when the SpotAllocation-
                            Strategy is lowest-price . Value must  be  in  the
                            range of 120.

                            Default: 2

                        SpotMaxPrice -> (string)
                            The maximum price per unit hour that you are will-
                            ing to pay for a Spot Instance.  If  your  maximum
                            price  is  lower  than  the Spot price for the in-
                            stance types that  you  selected,  your  Spot  In-
                            stances  are  not  launched.  We  do not recommend
                            specifying a maximum price because it can lead  to
                            increased   interruptions.   When  Spot  Instances
                            launch, you pay the current Spot price. To  remove
                            a  maximum  price that you previously set, include
                            the property but specify an empty string ("")  for
                            the value.

                            WARNING:
                               If  you specify a maximum price, your instances
                               will be interrupted more frequently than if you
                               do not specify one.

                            Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.001

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  string  that indicates that the response contains more items than
          can be returned in a single response. To receive  additional  items,
          specify this string for the NextToken value when requesting the next
          set of items. This value is null when there are no more items to re-
          turn.
