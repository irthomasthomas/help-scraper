NAME
       describe-load-balancer-target-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about the Elastic Load Balancing target groups for the
       specified Auto Scaling group.

       To determine the attachment status of the target group, use  the  State
       element  in  the  response.  When  you attach a target group to an Auto
       Scaling group, the initial State value is Adding .  The  state  transi-
       tions to Added after all Auto Scaling instances are registered with the
       target group. If Elastic Load Balancing health checks are  enabled  for
       the  Auto  Scaling  group,  the state transitions to InService after at
       least one Auto Scaling instance passes the health check. When the  tar-
       get group is in the InService state, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can termi-
       nate and replace any instances that are reported as  unhealthy.  If  no
       registered  instances  pass the health checks, the target group doesn't
       enter the InService state.

       Target groups also have an InService state if you attach  them  in  the
       CreateAutoScalingGroup  API  call. If your target group state is InSer-
       vice , but it is not working properly, check the scaling activities  by
       calling  DescribeScalingActivities and take any corrective actions nec-
       essary.

       For help with failed health checks, see Troubleshooting Amazon EC2 Auto
       Scaling:  Health checks in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide . For
       more information, see Use Elastic Load Balancing to distribute  traffic
       across  the instances in your Auto Scaling group in the Amazon EC2 Auto
       Scaling User Guide .

       describe-load-balancer-target-groups is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: LoadBalancerTargetGroups

SYNOPSIS
            describe-load-balancer-target-groups
          --auto-scaling-group-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe the load balancer target groups for an Auto Scaling group

       This example describes the load balancer target groups attached to  the
       specified Auto Scaling group.

          aws autoscaling describe-load-balancer-target-groups \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg

       Output:

          {
              "LoadBalancerTargetGroups": [
                  {
                      "LoadBalancerTargetGroupARN": "arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:targetgroup/my-targets/73e2d6bc24d8a067",
                      "State": "Added"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       LoadBalancerTargetGroups -> (list)
          Information about the target groups.

          (structure)
              Describes the state of a target group.

              LoadBalancerTargetGroupARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target group.

              State -> (string)
                 The state of the target group.

                 o Adding  -  The  Auto Scaling instances are being registered
                   with the target group.

                 o Added - All Auto Scaling instances are registered with  the
                   target group.

                 o InService  -  At  least one Auto Scaling instance passed an
                   ELB health check.

                 o Removing - The Auto Scaling instances  are  being  deregis-
                   tered  from the target group. If connection draining is en-
                   abled, Elastic Load Balancing waits for in-flight  requests
                   to complete before deregistering the instances.

                 o Removed  - All Auto Scaling instances are deregistered from
                   the target group.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A string that indicates that the response contains more  items  than
          can  be  returned in a single response. To receive additional items,
          specify this string for the NextToken value when requesting the next
          set of items. This value is null when there are no more items to re-
          turn.
