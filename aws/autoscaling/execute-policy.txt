EXECUTE-POLICY()                                              EXECUTE-POLICY()



NAME
       execute-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Executes  the  specified policy. This can be useful for testing the de-
       sign of your scaling policy.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            execute-policy
          [--auto-scaling-group-name <value>]
          --policy-name <value>
          [--honor-cooldown | --no-honor-cooldown]
          [--metric-value <value>]
          [--breach-threshold <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --policy-name (string)
          The name or ARN of the policy.

       --honor-cooldown | --no-honor-cooldown (boolean)
          Indicates whether Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits for the cooldown pe-
          riod to complete before executing the policy.

          Valid  only  if the policy type is SimpleScaling . For more informa-
          tion, see Scaling cooldowns for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling in the  Ama-
          zon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

       --metric-value (double)
          The metric value to compare to BreachThreshold . This enables you to
          execute a policy of type StepScaling and determine  which  step  ad-
          justment  to use. For example, if the breach threshold is 50 and you
          want to use a step adjustment with a lower bound of 0 and  an  upper
          bound of 10, you can set the metric value to 59.

          If  you specify a metric value that doesn't correspond to a step ad-
          justment for the policy, the call returns an error.

          Required if the policy type is StepScaling and not supported  other-
          wise.

       --breach-threshold (double)
          The breach threshold for the alarm.

          Required  if the policy type is StepScaling and not supported other-
          wise.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To execute a scaling policy

       This example executes the scaling policy named my-step-scale-out-policy
       for the specified Auto Scaling group.

          aws autoscaling execute-policy \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
              --policy-name  my-step-scale-out-policy \
              --metric-value 95 \
              --breach-threshold 80

       This command produces no output.

       For  more information, see Step and simple scaling policies in the Ama-
       zon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
