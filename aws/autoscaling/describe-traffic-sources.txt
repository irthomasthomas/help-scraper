DESCRIBE-TRAFFIC-SOURCES()                          DESCRIBE-TRAFFIC-SOURCES()



NAME
       describe-traffic-sources -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about the traffic sources for the specified Auto Scal-
       ing group.

       You can optionally provide a traffic source  type.  If  you  provide  a
       traffic  source type, then the results only include that traffic source
       type.

       If you do not provide a traffic source type, then the  results  include
       all the traffic sources for the specified Auto Scaling group.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --traffic-source-type (string)
          The traffic source type that you want to describe.

          The following lists the valid values:

          o elb if the traffic source is a Classic Load Balancer.

          o elbv2  if the traffic source is a Application Load Balancer, Gate-
            way Load Balancer, or Network Load Balancer.

          o vpc-lattice if the traffic source is VPC Lattice.

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return.  (You  received  this
          token from a previous call.)

       --max-records (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of items to return with this call. The maximum
          value is 50 .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       TrafficSources -> (list)
          Information about the traffic sources.

          (structure)
              Describes the state of a traffic source.

              TrafficSource -> (string)
                 This is replaced by Identifier .

              State -> (string)
                 Describes the current state of a traffic source.

                 The state values are as follows:

                 o Adding - The Auto Scaling instances  are  being  registered
                   with the load balancer or target group.

                 o Added  - All Auto Scaling instances are registered with the
                   load balancer or target group.

                 o InService - For an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer  or
                   target  group, at least one Auto Scaling instance passed an
                   ELB health check. For VPC Lattice, at least one Auto  Scal-
                   ing instance passed an VPC_LATTICE health check.

                 o Removing  -  The  Auto Scaling instances are being deregis-
                   tered from the load balancer or target group. If connection
                   draining  (deregistration  delay)  is enabled, Elastic Load
                   Balancing or VPC Lattice waits for  in-flight  requests  to
                   complete before deregistering the instances.

                 o Removed  - All Auto Scaling instances are deregistered from
                   the load balancer or target group.

              Identifier -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the traffic source.

              Type -> (string)
                 Provides additional context for the value of Identifier .

                 The following lists the valid values:

                 o elb if Identifier is the name of a Classic Load Balancer.

                 o elbv2 if Identifier is the ARN of an Application Load  Bal-
                   ancer, Gateway Load Balancer, or Network Load Balancer tar-
                   get group.

                 o vpc-lattice if Identifier is the ARN of a VPC Lattice  tar-
                   get group.

                 Required if the identifier is the name of a Classic Load Bal-
                 ancer.

       NextToken -> (string)
          This string indicates that the response contains more items than can
          be returned in a single response. To receive additional items, spec-
          ify this string for the NextToken value when requesting the next set
          of items. This value is null when there are no more items to return.
