OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --traffic-source-type (string)
          The type of traffic source you are describing. Currently,  the  only
          valid value is vpc-lattice .

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  for  the next set of items to return. (You received this
          token from a previous call.)

       --max-records (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return with this  call.  The  maximum
          value is 50 .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       TrafficSources -> (list)
          Information about the traffic sources.

          (structure)
              Describes the state of a traffic source.

              TrafficSource -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the traffic source. Currently,  this
                 is  the  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) for a VPC Lattice target
                 group.

              State -> (string)
                 The following are the possible states for a VPC Lattice  tar-
                 get group:

                 o Adding  -  The  Auto Scaling instances are being registered
                   with the target group.

                 o Added - All Auto Scaling instances are registered with  the
                   target group.

                 o InService  -  At least one Auto Scaling instance passed the
                   VPC_LATTICE health check.

                 o Removing - The Auto Scaling instances  are  being  deregis-
                   tered  from the target group. If connection draining is en-
                   abled, VPC Lattice waits for in-flight requests to complete
                   before deregistering the instances.

                 o Removed  - All Auto Scaling instances are deregistered from
                   the target group.

       NextToken -> (string)
          This string indicates that the response contains more items than can
          be returned in a single response. To receive additional items, spec-
          ify this string for the NextToken value when requesting the next set
          of items. This value is null when there are no more items to return.
