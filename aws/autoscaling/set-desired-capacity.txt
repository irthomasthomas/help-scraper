SET-DESIRED-CAPACITY()                                  SET-DESIRED-CAPACITY()



NAME
       set-desired-capacity -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets the size of the specified Auto Scaling group.

       If  a  scale-in  activity  occurs  as a result of a new DesiredCapacity
       value that is lower than the current size of the group, the Auto  Scal-
       ing  group  uses its termination policy to determine which instances to
       terminate.

       For more information, see Manual scaling in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
       User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --desired-capacity (integer)
          The  desired  capacity  is  the initial capacity of the Auto Scaling
          group after this operation completes and the capacity it attempts to
          maintain.

       --honor-cooldown | --no-honor-cooldown (boolean)
          Indicates whether Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits for the cooldown pe-
          riod to complete before initiating a scaling activity  to  set  your
          Auto  Scaling group to its new capacity. By default, Amazon EC2 Auto
          Scaling does not honor the cooldown period during manual scaling ac-
          tivities.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To set the desired capacity for an Auto Scaling group

       This  example  sets the desired capacity for the specified Auto Scaling
       group.

          aws autoscaling set-desired-capacity \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
              --desired-capacity 2 \
              --honor-cooldown

       This command returns to the prompt if successful.

OUTPUT
       None
