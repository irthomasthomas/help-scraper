NAME
       describe-launch-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about the launch configurations in the account and Re-
       gion.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-launch-configurations is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: LaunchConfigurations

OPTIONS
       --launch-configuration-names (list)
          The  launch  configuration  names.  If  you  omit this property, all
          launch configurations are described.

          Array Members: Maximum number of 50 items.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 2: To describe a specified number of launch configurations

       To   return  a  specific  number  of  launch  configurations,  use  the
       --max-items option.

          aws autoscaling describe-launch-configurations \
              --max-items 1

       If the output includes a NextToken field, there are more launch config-
       urations. To get the additional launch configurations, use the value of
       this field with the --starting-token option in  a  subsequent  call  as
       follows.

          aws autoscaling describe-launch-configurations \
              --starting-token Z3M3LMPEXAMPLE

                            The snapshot ID of the volume to use.

                            You  must  specify  either a VolumeSize or a Snap-
                            shotId .

                        VolumeSize -> (integer)
                            The volume size, in GiBs. The  following  are  the
                            supported volumes sizes for each volume type:

                            o gp2 and gp3 : 1-16,384

                            o io1 : 4-16,384

                            o st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384

                            o standard : 1-1,024

                            You  must specify either a SnapshotId or a Volume-
                            Size . If you specify both SnapshotId and  Volume-
                            Size  ,  the  volume size must be equal or greater
                            than the size of the snapshot.

                        VolumeType -> (string)
                            The volume type. For more information, see  Amazon
                            EBS volume types in the Amazon EBS User Guide .

                            Valid  values:  standard | io1 | gp2 | st1 | sc1 |
                            gp3

                        DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                            Indicates whether the volume  is  deleted  on  in-
                            stance  termination.  For Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling,
                            the default value is true .

                        Iops -> (integer)
                            The number of input/output  (I/O)  operations  per
                            second (IOPS) to provision for the volume. For gp3
                            and io1 volumes, this  represents  the  number  of
                            IOPS  that are provisioned for the volume. For gp2
                            volumes, this represents the baseline  performance
                            of the volume and the rate at which the volume ac-
                            cumulates I/O credits for bursting.

                            The following are the supported  values  for  each
                            volume type:

                            o gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS

                            o io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                            For io1 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only for
                            Instances built on the Amazon Web  Services  Nitro
                            System . Other instance families guarantee perfor-
                            mance up to 32,000 IOPS.
                               Iops is supported when the volume type  is  gp3
                               or  io1  and required only when the volume type
                               is io1 . (Not used with standard , gp2 , st1  ,
                               or sc1 volumes.)

                        Encrypted -> (boolean)
                            Specifies  whether the volume should be encrypted.
                            Encrypted EBS volumes can only be attached to  in-
                            stances  that  support  Amazon EBS encryption. For
                            more information, see Requirements for Amazon  EBS
                            encryption  in the Amazon EBS User Guide . If your
                            AMI uses encrypted  volumes,  you  can  also  only
                            launch it on supported instance types.

                            NOTE:
                               If  you  are creating a volume from a snapshot,
                               you cannot create an unencrypted volume from an
                               encrypted  snapshot. Also, you cannot specify a
                               KMS key ID when using a launch configuration.

                               If you enable encryption by  default,  the  EBS
                               volumes  that  you create are always encrypted,
                               either using the Amazon  Web  Services  managed
                               KMS  key or a customer-managed KMS key, regard-
                               less of whether the snapshot was encrypted.

                               For more information, see Use Amazon  Web  Ser-
                               vices KMS keys to encrypt Amazon EBS volumes in

                        Throughput -> (integer)
                            The throughput (MiBps) to provision for a gp3 vol-
                            ume.

                     NoDevice -> (boolean)
                        Setting  this  value to true prevents a volume that is
                        included in the block device mapping of the  AMI  from
                        being mapped to the specified device name at launch.

                        If  NoDevice  is  true  for the root device, instances
                        might fail the EC2 health check. In that case,  Amazon
                        EC2 Auto Scaling launches replacement instances.

              InstanceMonitoring -> (structure)
                 Controls  whether  instances  in this group are launched with
                 detailed (true ) or basic (false ) monitoring.

                 For more information, see Configure monitoring for Auto Scal-
                 ing instances in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     If  true , detailed monitoring is enabled. Otherwise, ba-
                     sic monitoring is enabled.

              SpotPrice -> (string)
                 The maximum hourly price to be paid  for  any  Spot  Instance
                 launched  to fulfill the request. Spot Instances are launched
                 when the price you specify exceeds the  current  Spot  price.
                 For  more  information,  see  Requesting  Spot  Instances for
                 fault-tolerant and flexible applications in  the  Amazon  EC2
                 Auto Scaling User Guide .

              IamInstanceProfile -> (string)
                 The  name  or  the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance
                 profile associated with the IAM role for  the  instance.  The
                 instance profile contains the IAM role. For more information,
                 see IAM role for applications that  run  on  Amazon  EC2  in-
                 stances in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The creation date and time for the launch configuration.

              EbsOptimized -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  the launch configuration is optimized for
                 EBS I/O (true ) or not (false ). For  more  information,  see
                 Amazon  EBS-optimized  instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide
                 for Linux Instances .

              AssociatePublicIpAddress -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether to assign a  public  IPv4  address  to  the
                 group's instances. If the instance is launched into a default
                 subnet, the default is to assign a public IPv4  address,  un-
                 less  you disabled the option to assign a public IPv4 address
                 on the subnet. If the instance is launched into a  nondefault
                 subnet,  the  default is not to assign a public IPv4 address,
                 unless you enabled the option to assign a public IPv4 address
                 on the subnet. For more information, see Provide network con-
                 nectivity for your Auto Scaling instances using Amazon VPC in
                 the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

              PlacementTenancy -> (string)
                 The tenancy of the instance, either default or dedicated . An
                 instance with dedicated tenancy runs on isolated, single-ten-
                 ant hardware and can only be launched into a VPC.

              MetadataOptions -> (structure)
                 The metadata options for the instances. For more information,
                 see Configure the instance metadata options in the Amazon EC2
                 Auto Scaling User Guide .

                 HttpTokens -> (string)
                     The  state  of token usage for your instance metadata re-
                     quests. If the parameter is not specified in the request,
                     the default state is optional .

                     If the state is optional , you can choose to retrieve in-
                     stance metadata with or without a signed token header  on
                     your  request.  If  you retrieve the IAM role credentials
                     without a token, the version 1.0 role credentials are re-
                     turned.  If you retrieve the IAM role credentials using a
                     valid signed token, the version 2.0 role credentials  are
                     returned.

                     If  the  state is required , you must send a signed token
                     header with any instance metadata retrieval requests.  In
                     this  state,  retrieving  the IAM role credentials always
                     returns the version 2.0 credentials; the version 1.0 cre-
                     dentials are not available.

                 HttpPutResponseHopLimit -> (integer)
                     The  desired  HTTP  PUT  response  hop limit for instance
                     metadata requests. The larger the number, the further in-
                     stance metadata requests can travel.

                     Default: 1

                 HttpEndpoint -> (string)
                     This parameter enables or disables the HTTP metadata end-
                     point on your instances. If the parameter is  not  speci-
                     fied, the default state is enabled .

                     NOTE:
                        If  you  specify a value of disabled , you will not be
                        able to access your instance metadata.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A string that indicates that the response contains more  items  than
          can  be  returned in a single response. To receive additional items,
          specify this string for the NextToken value when requesting the next
          set of items. This value is null when there are no more items to re-
          turn.
