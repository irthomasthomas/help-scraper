DETACH-INSTANCES()                                          DETACH-INSTANCES()



NAME
       detach-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes one or more instances from the specified Auto Scaling group.

       After  the  instances  are detached, you can manage them independent of
       the Auto Scaling group.

       If you do not specify the option to  decrement  the  desired  capacity,
       Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches instances to replace the ones that are
       detached.

       If there is a Classic Load Balancer attached to the Auto Scaling group,
       the  instances  are  deregistered  from the load balancer. If there are
       target groups attached to the Auto Scaling  group,  the  instances  are
       deregistered from the target groups.

       For  more information, see Detach or attach instances in the Amazon EC2
       Auto Scaling User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --instance-ids (list)
          The IDs of the instances. You can specify up to 20 instances.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --should-decrement-desired-capacity | --no-should-decrement-desired-ca-
       pacity (boolean)
          Indicates  whether the Auto Scaling group decrements the desired ca-
          pacity value by the number of instances detached.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To detach an instance from an Auto Scaling group

       This  example  detaches  the specified instance from the specified Auto
       Scaling group.
