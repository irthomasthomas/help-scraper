PUT-WARM-POOL()                                                PUT-WARM-POOL()



NAME
       put-warm-pool -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or updates a warm pool for the specified Auto Scaling group. A
       warm pool is a pool of pre-initialized EC2 instances that  sits  along-
       side  the  Auto Scaling group. Whenever your application needs to scale
       out, the Auto Scaling group can draw on the warm pool to meet  its  new
       desired  capacity. For more information and example configurations, see
       Warm pools for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling in the Amazon EC2  Auto  Scaling
       User Guide .

       This operation must be called from the Region in which the Auto Scaling
       group was created. This operation cannot be called on an  Auto  Scaling
       group  that has a mixed instances policy or a launch template or launch
       configuration that requests Spot Instances.

       You can view the instances in the warm pool using the  DescribeWarmPool
       API  call. If you are no longer using a warm pool, you can delete it by
       calling the  DeleteWarmPool API.

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --max-group-prepared-capacity (integer)
          Specifies the maximum number of instances that are allowed to be  in
          the warm pool or in any state except Terminated for the Auto Scaling
          group. This is an optional property. Specify it only if you  do  not
          want  the  warm pool size to be determined by the difference between
          the group's maximum capacity and its desired capacity.

          WARNING:
              If a value for MaxGroupPreparedCapacity is not specified, Amazon
              EC2  Auto  Scaling launches and maintains the difference between
              the group's maximum capacity and its desired  capacity.  If  you
              specify  a  value for MaxGroupPreparedCapacity , Amazon EC2 Auto
              Scaling uses the difference between the MaxGroupPreparedCapacity
              and the desired capacity instead.

              The  size  of  the  warm pool is dynamic. Only when MaxGroupPre-
              paredCapacity and MinSize are set to the  same  value  does  the
              warm pool have an absolute size.

          If the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group is higher than the
          MaxGroupPreparedCapacity , the capacity of the warm pool is  0,  un-
          less  you  specify  a value for MinSize . To remove a value that you
          previously set, include the property but specify -1 for the value.

       --min-size (integer)
          Specifies the minimum number of instances to maintain  in  the  warm
          pool. This helps you to ensure that there is always a certain number
          of warmed instances available to handle traffic spikes. Defaults  to
          0 if not specified.

       --pool-state (string)
          Sets the instance state to transition to after the lifecycle actions
          are complete. Default is Stopped .

          Possible values:

          o Stopped

          o Running

          o Hibernated

       --instance-reuse-policy (structure)
          Indicates whether instances in the Auto Scaling  group  can  be  re-
          turned to the warm pool on scale in. The default is to terminate in-
          stances in the Auto Scaling group when the group scales in.

          ReuseOnScaleIn -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether instances in the Auto Scaling group can be re-
              turned to the warm pool on scale in.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ReuseOnScaleIn=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ReuseOnScaleIn": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a warm pool

       The  following example creates a warm pool for the specified Auto Scal-
       ing group.

          aws autoscaling put-warm-pool \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
              --min-size 2

       This command produces no output. If a warm pool already exists, it will
       be updated.

       For more information, see Warm pools for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling in the
       Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
