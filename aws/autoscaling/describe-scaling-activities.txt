DESCRIBE-SCALING-ACTIVITIES()                    DESCRIBE-SCALING-ACTIVITIES()



NAME
       describe-scaling-activities -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information  about  the scaling activities in the account and Re-
       gion.

       When scaling events occur, you see a record of the scaling activity  in
       the  scaling activities. For more information, see Verify a scaling ac-
       tivity for an Auto Scaling group in the Amazon EC2  Auto  Scaling  User
       Guide .

       If  the  scaling event succeeds, the value of the StatusCode element in
       the response is Successful . If an attempt to launch instances  failed,
       the  StatusCode value is Failed or Cancelled and the StatusMessage ele-
       ment in the response indicates the cause of the failure. For  help  in-
       terpreting  the  StatusMessage  ,  see  Troubleshooting Amazon EC2 Auto
       Scaling in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-scaling-activities is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: Activities

OPTIONS
       --activity-ids (list)
          The activity IDs of the desired scaling activities. If you omit this
          property, all activities for the past six weeks  are  described.  If
          unknown activities are requested, they are ignored with no error. If
          you specify an Auto Scaling group, the results are limited  to  that
          group.

          Array Members: Maximum number of 50 IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --include-deleted-groups | --no-include-deleted-groups (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  to  include  scaling  activity from deleted Auto
          Scaling groups.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To describe scaling activities for the specified group

       This example describes the scaling activities for  the  specified  Auto
       Scaling group.

          aws autoscaling describe-scaling-activities \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg

       Example 3: To describe a specified number of scaling activities

       To return a specific number of activities, use the --max-items option.

          aws autoscaling describe-scaling-activities \
              --max-items 1

       Output:

          {
              "Activities": [

                  }
              ]
          }

       If the output includes a NextToken field, there are more activities. To
       get  the  additional  activities,  use the value of this field with the
       --starting-token option in a subsequent call as follows.

          aws autoscaling describe-scaling-activities \
              --starting-token Z3M3LMPEXAMPLE
