DELETE-AUTO-SCALING-GROUP()                        DELETE-AUTO-SCALING-GROUP()



NAME
       delete-auto-scaling-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified Auto Scaling group.

       If  the group has instances or scaling activities in progress, you must
       specify the option to force the deletion in order for it to succeed.

       If the group has policies, deleting the group deletes the policies, the
       underlying  alarm  actions, and any alarm that no longer has an associ-
       ated action.

       To remove instances from the Auto Scaling  group  before  deleting  it,
       call the  DetachInstances API with the list of instances and the option
       to decrement the desired capacity. This ensures that  Amazon  EC2  Auto
       Scaling does not launch replacement instances.

       To terminate all instances before deleting the Auto Scaling group, call
       the  UpdateAutoScalingGroup API and set the minimum  size  and  desired
       capacity of the Auto Scaling group to zero.

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --force-delete | --no-force-delete (boolean)
          Specifies  that  the group is to be deleted along with all instances
          associated with the group, without waiting for all instances  to  be
          terminated.  This  action also deletes any outstanding lifecycle ac-
          tions associated with the group.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To delete the specified Auto Scaling group

       This example deletes the specified Auto Scaling group.

          aws autoscaling delete-auto-scaling-group \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Deleting your Auto Scaling infrastructure  in
       the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.

       Example 2: To force delete the specified Auto Scaling group

       To  delete  the Auto Scaling group without waiting for the instances in
       the group to terminate, use the --force-delete option.

          aws autoscaling delete-auto-scaling-group \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
              --force-delete
