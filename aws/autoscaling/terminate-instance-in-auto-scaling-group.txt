TERMINATE-INSTANCE-IN-AUTO-SCALING-GTERMINATE-INSTANCE-IN-AUTO-SCALING-GROUP()



NAME
       terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Terminates  the  specified  instance and optionally adjusts the desired
       group size. This operation cannot be called  on  instances  in  a  warm
       pool.

       This  call simply makes a termination request. The instance is not ter-
       minated immediately. When an instance is terminated, the instance  sta-
       tus  changes  to terminated . You can't connect to or start an instance
       after you've terminated it.

       If you do not specify the option to  decrement  the  desired  capacity,
       Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches instances to replace the ones that are
       terminated.

       By default, Amazon EC2  Auto  Scaling  balances  instances  across  all
       Availability  Zones.  If  you decrement the desired capacity, your Auto
       Scaling group can become unbalanced between Availability Zones.  Amazon
       EC2  Auto  Scaling  tries to rebalance the group, and rebalancing might
       terminate instances in other zones. For more  information,  see  Manual
       scaling in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the instance.

       --should-decrement-desired-capacity | --no-should-decrement-desired-ca-
       pacity (boolean)
          Indicates whether terminating the instance also decrements the  size
          of the Auto Scaling group.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To terminate an instance in an Auto Scaling group

       This  example terminates the specified instance from the specified Auto
       Scaling group without updating the size of the group. Amazon  EC2  Auto
       Scaling  launches  a  replacement instance after the specified instance
       terminates.
