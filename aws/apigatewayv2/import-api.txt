OPTIONS
       --basepath (string)
          Specifies  how  to interpret the base path of the API during import.
          Valid values are ignore, prepend, and split. The  default  value  is
          ignore.  To learn more, see Set the OpenAPI basePath Property . Sup-
          ported only for HTTP APIs.

       --body (string)
          The OpenAPI definition. Supported only for HTTP APIs.

       --fail-on-warnings | --no-fail-on-warnings (boolean)
          Specifies whether to rollback the API creation when a warning is en-
          countered.  By  default,  API creation continues if a warning is en-
          countered.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To import an HTTP API

       The  following  import-api  example creates an HTTP API from an OpenAPI
       3.0 definition file named api-definition.yaml.

          aws apigatewayv2 import-api \
              --body file://api-definition.yaml

       Contents of api-definition.yaml:

          openapi: 3.0.1
          info:
              title: My Lambda API
              version: v1.0
          paths:
              /hello:
                  x-amazon-apigateway-any-method:

                          connectionType: INTERNET

       Output:

OUTPUT
       ApiEndpoint -> (string)
          The  URI  of the API, of the form {api-id}.execute-api.{region}.ama-
          zonaws.com. The stage name is typically appended to this URI to form
          a complete path to a deployed API stage.

       ApiGatewayManaged -> (boolean)
          Specifies whether an API is managed by API Gateway. You can't update
          or delete a managed API by using API Gateway. A managed API  can  be
          deleted only through the tooling or service that created it.

       ApiId -> (string)
          The API ID.

       ApiKeySelectionExpression -> (string)
          An  API key selection expression. Supported only for WebSocket APIs.
          See API Key Selection Expressions .

       CorsConfiguration -> (structure)
          A CORS configuration. Supported only for HTTP APIs.

          AllowCredentials -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether credentials are included in the CORS  request.
              Supported only for HTTP APIs.

          AllowHeaders -> (list)
              Represents  a  collection of allowed headers. Supported only for
              HTTP APIs.

              (string)

          AllowMethods -> (list)
              Represents a collection of allowed HTTP methods. Supported  only

                 A string with a length between [1-64].

          AllowOrigins -> (list)
              Represents  a  collection of allowed origins. Supported only for
              HTTP APIs.

              (string)

          ExposeHeaders -> (list)
              Represents a collection of exposed headers. Supported  only  for
              HTTP APIs.

              (string)

          MaxAge -> (integer)
              The  number  of  seconds that the browser should cache preflight
              request results. Supported only for HTTP APIs.

       CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp when the API was created.

       Description -> (string)
          The description of the API.

       DisableSchemaValidation -> (boolean)
          Avoid validating models when creating a deployment.  Supported  only
          for WebSocket APIs.

       DisableExecuteApiEndpoint -> (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  clients can invoke your API by using the default
          execute-api endpoint. By default, clients can invoke your  API  with
          the default https://{api_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com end-
          point. To require that clients use a custom domain  name  to  invoke
          your API, disable the default endpoint.

       ImportInfo -> (list)
          The  validation information during API import. This may include par-
          ticular properties of your OpenAPI definition which are ignored dur-

          If  not provided, this will be the default for HTTP APIs. This prop-
          erty is required for WebSocket APIs.

          ing API import.

          (string)
