GET-DEPLOYMENTS()                                            GET-DEPLOYMENTS()



NAME
       get-deployments -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the Deployments for an API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-deployments is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Items

SYNOPSIS
            get-deployments
          --api-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The API identifier.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (string)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve a list of deployments

       The  following  get-deployments  example  displays  a list of all of an
       API's deployments.

          aws apigatewayv2 get-deployments \
              --api-id a1b2c3d4

       Output:

          {
              "Items": [
                  {
                      "AutoDeployed": true,
                      "CreatedDate": "2020-04-07T23:58:40Z",
                      "DeploymentId": "abcdef",
                      "DeploymentStatus": "DEPLOYED",
                      "Description": "Automatic deployment triggered by changes to the Api configuration"
                  },
                  {
                      "AutoDeployed": true,
                      "CreatedDate": "2020-04-06T00:33:00Z",
                      "DeploymentId": "bcdefg",
                      "DeploymentStatus": "DEPLOYED",
                      "Description": "Automatic deployment triggered by changes to the Api configuration"
                  }
              ]
          }

          (structure)
              An  immutable  representation  of  an  API that can be called by
              users. A Deployment must be associated with a Stage for it to be
              callable over the internet.

              AutoDeployed -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether a deployment was automatically released.

              CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the Deployment resource was created.

              DeploymentId -> (string)
                 The identifier for the deployment.

              DeploymentStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the deployment: PENDING, FAILED, or SUCCEEDED.

              DeploymentStatusMessage -> (string)
                 May  contain  additional feedback on the status of an API de-
                 ployment.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description for the deployment.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The next page of elements from this collection. Not  valid  for  the
          last element of the collection.
