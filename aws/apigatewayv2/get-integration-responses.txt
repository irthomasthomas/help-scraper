NAME
       get-integration-responses -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the IntegrationResponses for an Integration.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-integration-responses  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: Items

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The API identifier.

       --integration-id (string)
          The integration ID.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (string)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          The elements from this collection.

          (structure)
              Represents an integration response.

              ContentHandlingStrategy -> (string)
                 Supported  only  for  WebSocket APIs. Specifies how to handle
                 response payload content type conversions.  Supported  values
                 are CONVERT_TO_BINARY and CONVERT_TO_TEXT, with the following
                 behaviors:

                 CONVERT_TO_BINARY:  Converts  a  response  payload   from   a
                 Base64-encoded string to the corresponding binary blob.

                 CONVERT_TO_TEXT:  Converts  a  response payload from a binary
                 blob to a Base64-encoded string.

                 If this property is not defined, the response payload will be
                 passed through from the integration response to the route re-
                 sponse or method response without modification.

              IntegrationResponseId -> (string)
                 The integration response ID.

              IntegrationResponseKey -> (string)
                 The integration response key.

              ResponseParameters -> (map)
                 A key-value  map  specifying  response  parameters  that  are
                 passed  to the method response from the backend. The key is a
                 method response header parameter name and the mapped value is
                 an integration response header value, a static value enclosed
                 within a pair of single quotes, or a JSON expression from the
                 integration  response  body.  The  mapping key must match the
                 pattern of method.response.header.{name},  where  name  is  a
                 valid  and  unique  header  name. The mapped non-static value
                 must match the pattern of  integration.response.header.{name}
                 or integration.response.body.{JSON-expression}, where name is
                 a valid and unique response header name  and  JSON-expression
                 is a valid JSON expression without the $ prefix.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)
                     A string with a length between [1-512].

              ResponseTemplates -> (map)
                 The  collection of response templates for the integration re-
                 sponse as a string-to-string map of key-value pairs. Response
                 templates  are  represented  as  a key/value map, with a con-
                 tent-type as the key and a template as the value.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)
                     A string with a length between [0-32768].

              TemplateSelectionExpression -> (string)
                 The template selection expressions for  the  integration  re-
                 sponse.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  next  page  of elements from this collection. Not valid for the
          last element of the collection.
