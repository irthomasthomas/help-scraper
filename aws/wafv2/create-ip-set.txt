CREATE-IP-SET()                                                CREATE-IP-SET()



NAME
       create-ip-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  IPSet , which you use to identify web requests that origi-
       nate from specific IP addresses or ranges of IP addresses. For example,
       if  you're  receiving  a lot of requests from a ranges of IP addresses,
       you can configure WAF to block them using an IPSet that lists those  IP
       addresses.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the IP set. You cannot change the name of an IPSet after
          you create it.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront  distribution  or
          for  a regional application. A regional application can be an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an  App-
          Sync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, or an App Runner ser-
          vice.

          To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the  Region  US  East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI  -  Specify  the  Region  when  you  use the CloudFront scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --description (string)
          A description of the IP set that helps with identification.

       --ip-address-version (string)
          The version of the IP addresses, either IPV4 or IPV6 .

          Possible values:

          o IPV4

          o IPV6

       --addresses (list)
          Contains an array of strings that specifies  zero  or  more  IP  ad-
          dresses  or  blocks of IP addresses. All addresses must be specified
          using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation.  WAF  supports
          all IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR ranges except for /0 .

          Example address strings:

          o To  configure  WAF  to allow, block, or count requests that origi-
            nated from the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify 192.0.2.44/32 .

          o To configure WAF to allow, block, or count  requests  that  origi-
            nated  from  IP  addresses  from 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255, specify
            192.0.2.0/24 .

          o To configure WAF to allow, block, or count  requests  that  origi-
            nated from the IP address 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111,
            specify 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128 .

          o To configure WAF to allow, block, or count  requests  that  origi-
            nated from IP addresses 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 to
            1111:0000:0000:0000:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff,                   specify
            1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/64 .

          For  more  information  about CIDR notation, see the Wikipedia entry
          Classless Inter-Domain Routing .

          Example JSON Addresses specifications:

          o Empty array: "Addresses": []

          o Array with one address: "Addresses": ["192.0.2.44/32"]

          o Array  with  three   addresses:   "Addresses":   ["192.0.2.44/32",
            "192.0.2.0/24", "192.0.0.0/16"]

          o INVALID specification: "Addresses": [""] INVALID

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          An array of key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

          (structure)
              A  tag associated with an Amazon Web Services resource. Tags are
              key:value pairs that you can use to categorize and  manage  your
              resources,  for purposes like billing or other management. Typi-
              cally, the tag key represents a category, such as "environment",
              and  the tag value represents a specific value within that cate-
              gory, such as "test," "development,"  or  "production".  Or  you
              might  set  the  tag key to "customer" and the value to the cus-
              tomer name or ID. You can specify one or more  tags  to  add  to
              each Amazon Web Services resource, up to 50 tags for a resource.

              You  can  tag  the Amazon Web Services resources that you manage
              through WAF: web ACLs, rule groups, IP sets, and  regex  pattern
              sets. You can't manage or view tags through the WAF console.

              Key -> (string)
                 Part  of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a
                 tag key to describe a category of information, such as  "cus-
                 tomer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 Part  of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a
                 tag value to describe a specific  value  within  a  category,
                 such  as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are case-sensi-
                 tive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an IP set for use in your web ACLs and rule groups

       The following create-ip-set command creates an IP set with a single ad-
       dress range specification.

          aws wafv2 create-ip-set \
              --name testip \
              --scope REGIONAL \
              --ip-address-version IPV4 \
              --addresses 198.51.100.0/16

       Output:

          {
              "Summary":{
                  "ARN":"arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:regional/ipset/testip/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",

OUTPUT
       Summary -> (structure)
          High-level information about an  IPSet , returned by operations like
          create and list. This provides information like the ID, that you can
          use to retrieve and manage an IPSet , and the ARN, that you  provide
          to the  IPSetReferenceStatement to use the address set in a  Rule .

          Name -> (string)
              The  name  of the IP set. You cannot change the name of an IPSet
              after you create it.

          Id -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the set. This ID is returned in the  re-
              sponses  to  create  and list commands. You provide it to opera-
              tions like update and delete.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the IP set that helps with identification.

          LockToken -> (string)
              A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your
              get  and  list  requests, to mark the state of the entity at the
              time of the request. To make changes to  the  entity  associated
              with  the token, you provide the token to operations like update
              and delete . WAF uses the token to ensure that no  changes  have
              been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change
              has been made, the update fails with  a  WAFOptimisticLockExcep-
              tion  .  If  this happens, perform another get , and use the new
              token returned by that operation.

          ARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.
