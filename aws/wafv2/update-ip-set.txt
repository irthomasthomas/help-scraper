UPDATE-IP-SET()                                                UPDATE-IP-SET()



NAME
       update-ip-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the specified  IPSet .

       NOTE:
          This  operation  completely replaces the mutable specifications that
          you already have for the IP set with the ones that  you  provide  to
          this  call. To modify the IP set, retrieve it by calling  GetIPSet ,
          update the settings as needed, and then provide the complete IP  set
          specification to this call.

       When you make changes to web ACLs or web ACL components, like rules and
       rule groups, WAF propagates the changes everywhere that the web ACL and
       its  components  are  stored  and used. Your changes are applied within
       seconds, but there might be a brief period of  inconsistency  when  the
       changes have arrived in some places and not in others. So, for example,
       if you change a rule action setting, the action might be the old action
       in one area and the new action in another area. Or if you add an IP ad-
       dress to an IP set used in a  blocking  rule,  the  new  address  might
       briefly  be  blocked  in  one area while still allowed in another. This
       temporary inconsistency can occur when you first associate  a  web  ACL
       with an Amazon Web Services resource and when you change a web ACL that
       is already associated with a resource. Generally,  any  inconsistencies
       of this type last only a few seconds.

SYNOPSIS
            update-ip-set
          --name <value>
          --scope <value>
          --id <value>
          [--description <value>]
          --addresses <value>
          --lock-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the IP set. You cannot change the name of an IPSet after
          you create it.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront  distribution  or
          for  a regional application. A regional application can be an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST  API,  or  an
          AppSync GraphQL API.

          To  work  with  CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI - Specify the  Region  when  you  use  the  CloudFront  scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for  the  set. This ID is returned in the re-
          sponses to create and list commands. You provide  it  to  operations
          like update and delete.

       --description (string)
          A description of the IP set that helps with identification.

       --addresses (list)
          Contains  an  array  of  strings  that specifies zero or more IP ad-
          dresses or blocks of IP addresses in Classless Inter-Domain  Routing
          (CIDR)  notation.  WAF supports all IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR ranges except
          for /0.

          Example address strings:

          o To configure WAF to allow, block, or count  requests  that  origi-
            nated from the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify 192.0.2.44/32 .

          o To  configure  WAF  to allow, block, or count requests that origi-
            nated from IP addresses from  192.0.2.0  to  192.0.2.255,  specify
            192.0.2.0/24 .

          o To  configure  WAF  to allow, block, or count requests that origi-
            nated from the IP address 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111,
            specify 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128 .

          o To  configure  WAF  to allow, block, or count requests that origi-
            nated from IP addresses 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 to
            1111:0000:0000:0000:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff,                   specify
            1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/64 .

          For more information about CIDR notation, see  the  Wikipedia  entry
          Classless Inter-Domain Routing .

          Example JSON Addresses specifications:

          o Empty array: "Addresses": []

          o Array with one address: "Addresses": ["192.0.2.44/32"]

          o Array   with   three   addresses:  "Addresses":  ["192.0.2.44/32",
            "192.0.2.0/24", "192.0.0.0/16"]

          o INVALID specification: "Addresses": [""] INVALID

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --lock-token (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your get
          and  list  requests,  to mark the state of the entity at the time of
          the request. To make changes to the entity associated with  the  to-
          ken,  you  provide  the token to operations like update and delete .
          WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made  to  the
          entity  since  you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the
          update fails with a WAFOptimisticLockException .  If  this  happens,
          perform  another get , and use the new token returned by that opera-
          tion.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To modify the settings for an existing IP set

       The following update-ip-set updates the settings for the  specified  IP
       set.  This  call  requires  an  ID, which you can obtain from the call,
       list-ip-sets, and a lock token which you can  obtain  from  the  calls,
       list-ip-sets  and  get-ip-set. This call also returns a lock token that
       you can use for a subsequent update.

          aws wafv2 update-ip-set \
              --name testip \
              --scope REGIONAL \
              --id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 \
              --addresses 198.51.100.0/16 \
              --lock-token 447e55ac-2396-4c6d-b9f9-86b67c17f8b5

       Output:

          {
              "NextLockToken": "0674c84b-0304-47fe-8728-c6bff46af8fc"
          }

       For more information, see IP Sets and Regex Pattern  Sets  in  the  AWS
       WAF, AWS Firewall Manager, and AWS Shield Advanced Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       NextLockToken -> (string)
          A  token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns this token to your
          update requests. You use NextLockToken in the same manner as you use
          LockToken .
