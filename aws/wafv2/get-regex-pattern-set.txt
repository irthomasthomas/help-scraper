GET-REGEX-PATTERN-SET()                                GET-REGEX-PATTERN-SET()



NAME
       get-regex-pattern-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the specified  RegexPatternSet .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-regex-pattern-set
          --name <value>
          --scope <value>
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the set. You cannot change the name after you create the
          set.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront  distribution  or
          for  a regional application. A regional application can be an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an  App-
          Sync GraphQL API, or an Amazon Cognito user pool.

          To  work  with  CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI - Specify the  Region  when  you  use  the  CloudFront  scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for  the  set. This ID is returned in the re-
          sponses to create and list commands. You provide  it  to  operations
          like update and delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve a specific regex pattern set

       The  following  get-regex-pattern-set  retrieves  the regex pattern set
       with the specified name, scope, region, and ID. You can get the ID  for
       a  regex  pattern  set  from  the commands create-regex-pattern-set and
       list-regex-pattern-sets.

          aws wafv2 get-regex-pattern-set \
              --name regexPatterSet01 \
              --scope REGIONAL \
              --id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 \
              --region us-west-2

       Output:

          {
              "RegexPatternSet":{
                  "Description":"Test web-acl",
                  "RegularExpressionList":[
                      {
                          "RegexString":"/[0-9]*/"
                      },
                      {
                          "RegexString":"/[a-z]*/"
                      }
                  ],
                  "Name":"regexPatterSet01",
                  "ARN":"arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:regional/regexpatternset/regexPatterSet01/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "Id":"a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
              },
              "LockToken":"c8abf33f-b6fc-46ae-846e-42f994d57b29"
          }

OUTPUT
       RegexPatternSet -> (structure)
          Name -> (string)
              The name of the set. You cannot change the name after you create
              the set.

          Id -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the set. This ID is returned in the  re-
              sponses  to  create  and list commands. You provide it to opera-
              tions like update and delete.

          ARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the set that helps with identification.

          RegularExpressionList -> (list)
              The regular expression patterns in the set.

              (structure)
                 A single regular expression. This is  used  in  a   RegexPat-
                 ternSet .

                 RegexString -> (string)
                     The string representing the regular expression.

       LockToken -> (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your get
          and list requests, to mark the state of the entity at  the  time  of
          the  request.  To make changes to the entity associated with the to-
          ken, you provide the token to operations like update  and  delete  .
          WAF  uses  the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the
          entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been  made,  the
          update  fails  with  a WAFOptimisticLockException . If this happens,
          perform another get , and use the new token returned by that  opera-
          tion.
